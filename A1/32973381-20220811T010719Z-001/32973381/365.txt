 <p> Well I was not expecting much, just a fun afternoon or two of reading. But I could hardly make myself finish it, it was so bad.Here are some reasons why :* A desperate dragon seeking his mate, and after 3 days thinks of giving up! People take more time to choose clothes!* Cody (the found mate) is a prostitute. Dragon may not catch anything from him (and vice versa), but who said that Cody does not have some STD already? And not one of them thinks it would be wise to check....* Cody (said mate) has no friends. None. What does that say about his psychological profile? Not much good, frankly.* In the court of fearie our Cody manages to be bored! How??? He makes no move to learn customs/culture/language or anything else. Which frankly speaks more about him then anybody else, and makes him VERY unlikable.* No one mentions the difference in prospective life-spans of dragons and humans, which is like 100x.....* The fearie king is said to be very smart and capable, but we see none of that....etc, etc </p>

 <p> Reviewed by BookAddictfor TheRomanceReviews.comSnarky rent boys are in high demand as of late. When Cody is debating a change for something better, Kirit offers him a chance he cannot pass up. Once Cody learns more about Kirit, perhaps he shouldn't have been so quick to leave his home. Finding out the handsome man who is great in bed is from another world is not an everyday occurrence.Cody works the clubs as an independent entertainment contractor. Kirit is a dragon shifter from a race known as a Draak. He lives beyond the Veil where other magical beings exist--Fae, ogres and druids. Kirit has been alive for a long time and pines for a mate. Tired of waiting, he comes to Earth to search for a mate. When he finds Cody, he won't let him go.The plot of this story is simple and lightheartedly fun. Even Cody at times pokes fun of a true mate. Ms. Mahoney is a good storyteller who keeps the story lively with comical characters. The characters are adorable. Cody is a boy with an attitude. He is irreverent to those with authority, although usually at a respectful distance. Kirit is a funny character because he takes everything so literally. His lack of understanding makes him quite endearing. The dynamic between the two characters is hysterical at times and gooey loving at others. Kirit's possessiveness is adorable as he growls and keeps Cody close to his side.The story flows at a decent pace. Ms. Mahoney clues the reader in on a conspiracy which is neatly resolved by the end of the book. However, there are a few threads in this story which are not fully explained. For example, Cal is aware of witches but it is never explained exactly how he crossed their paths before. In addition, the worldbuilding is a bit light. For those who read fantasy frequently, they can fill in the blanks. For those who are not familiar with fantasy, it may be a bit hard to understand. This paranormal romance is recommended to m/m readers who love dragons. </p>

 <p> The first book in A Dragon&#8217;s Treasure series is a fascinating m/m story of dragons, fairies and other fae that entices the reader to join them in their world.  Dragon antics and manipulative Kings lead the couple into some intense, dangerous and sometimes humorous situations that add lots of spice to the story.  Snarky and funny dialogue also elicit quite a few chuckles and with lots of fun and charming characters this story becomes a very entertaining read that I couldn&#8217;t put down.  The author has added her own spin to the paranormal world and Faerie Realm that certainly has lots of potential for future books. I am really glad that Nyx&#8217;s book is next because I can&#8217;t wait to read about his mate.See my full review at: The Jeep Diva .com </p>

 <p> - More character development needed for the Fae and King Seamus- More information needed about court politics- A better picture needed of the land and towns beyond the VeilThe dragons were portrayed beautifully. Grumpy, brutal warriors on the outside, loving and possessive on the inside.  Cody was resilient, tenacious, and loyal. He stood up to his intimidating dragon mate Kirik (whom I loved) and braved the Court for Kirik's sake. I quite liked the couple. Recommended. </p>

 <p> Reviewed by MM Good Book ReviewsThis is the first book in this series and I can tell from the first paragraph that it was going to be an amazing read and I was right. It gave me a world full of fantasies that were just perfect. I love the paranormal worlds a lot more than just a normal romance story because it seems that so much more thought went goes into it. This is about amazing dragon shifters and a fae court. There are a mixture of different types of paranormals in this book. I love that even though Cody was a rent boy, he still seems to have not lost that zeal of life. He is just trying to pay the rent and bills so he sells his body to do it. However he had decided for a break, seems that even he was getting tired of the same old same old. Hiding behind a dumpster in the alley, taking a break from the problems around him Cody was found by Kirit. A very sexy man with an attitude and a quirky way of talking.Kirit was tired of living in a world without a mate, so he decides to go to earth and search for his one and only. Although dragons can have many choices, they get a sense from one by their scent, however due to a fight Kirit had lost that part of him, so he has to wait for a pull of some sort. He had at first decided to use a witch to help him find his mate, but surprise he finds it while out walking from a club. He felt the pull to take this man. He is of an old world standing so when Cody talks most of the time he has no idea what he is saying.Once Cody excepts, he wisk him back through the portal to his world only to find himself and his mate stuck at the palace because the king wanted to meet Cody. They get stuck there when a council was going to come there to court, Shemas wanted Kirit's help with them. What they had not expected was it was all a test to see if Cody could handle it. With Cody's quirky attitude he was well loved by many, even fighting his own battles when needed. The only problem was a dragon wants to always be the hero so he had to fix that part of it.This story is funny and I pretty much laughed through the whole book. Everytime someone said something it would be answered with I don't understand that. It was a recurring joke for all of them. I can't wait to read the next book in this series. It is a quirky little story and I was amazed to find out that I read it in one setting. I would recommend this story to anyone who loved the paranormal worlds, dragons, sexy men and hot sex. Bring on book two because I can't wait to read it. </p>

 <p> I read so many books and am disappointed that it is positively a miracle of nature when I find one I like so well as this.  Like Goldilocks I thought that one book ended in the middle of the story, another had this pretentious weenie alpha who had to be rescued by his mate and a third had a guy that wanted to marry the wicked witch of the west instead of the hero...  Well, books have annoyed me lately.  That's all I will say about that.  But this one was perfect and delicious and funny and had a dragon as the hero.  I liked everything about the plot and I loved all the characters.  I have been re-reading it off and on since I first got it.Cody is working as a prostitute in Denver, Colorado, (don't judge him, we never get to hear much about his background except he grew up on the streets and has occasionally been given black eyes) when one of his potential customers is just too attractive to deal with in the regular way.  The muscular man named Kirit, who blushes so cutely, insists on feeding him and following him around.  It turns out he's a dragon, (yes, the large fire-breathing, flying kind) and Cody is the mate he's been seeking for so long.  Unfortunately, for them to be together Cody will have to travel back with Kirit to his homeworld Faerie... where there is no modern technology, only magic.  Before they can travel to Kirit's home the king of Faerie insists they visit his castle.  The dragons, of which Kirit is an important member, are crucial to the king's power base and political intrigues endanger Cody's life, before he can even start his honeymoon.  I especially loved how well the dragon's were described and what different characters they all had.  Chaos, a brother dragon, was a riot.  The whole book was well done and you get a happy ending and a potential sequal to boot.  This is what five stars are all about!  Check out "Lucky"Luckyalso by this author.  Another excellent fantasy story! </p>

 <p> 2.5Amusing, in a simplistic insubstantial way. There wasn't much here. A couple OK sex scenes, some over the top snark, and a lot of aimless, self-created mess that passed for action. Meh. I thought Kirit's good-natured (if grumpy), borderline dim-wittedness was pretty adorable and the other dragons were interesting side kicks. Cody however grated on just about every nerve I have. But then, overly mouthy characters that mysteriously get away with aggressing on power figures who would otherwise crush disrespectful persons always annoy me. Essentially, I was disappointed with a lot of aspect of the book, but still managed to enjoy it on the most base levels. </p>

 <p> So I love dragons and when this book was on sale for 0.99 cents I figured I could try it for such low price. And I have read something by this writer before, so it was not a complete unknown.I certainly thought that since the story was pretty long a lot of things could have been portrayed in more depth than it was - characters, world building, everything (and half of the sex scenes could have been cut - here we go page space to develop characters and world more than it was).I was also hoping for some kind of falling in love between Kirit and Cody rather than - boom, you are *Mine treasure, mine*.Having said it, despite wishing for more depth, the main guys were fun and writing was very funny. I am very tired of BIG VERY BIG guy and little twink pairing in m/m, but at least here Cody was strong, stubborn and resilient character, who also seemed to have a sense of humor, so I went along with it.Kirit, despite instant mating attraction seemed to be actually nice, rather than the arrogant you know who when he was dealing with Cody. I mean, he was roaring and saying Mine a lot, but I did not see him ever doing anything without making sure Cody wanted it . Staying in the palace was not something either of them wanted, so that did not count.&#34;He turned his head away. &#34;Don't,&#34; he requested.&#34;Get used to it. Mine&#34;The big guy really liked that word.&#34;I would probably check out next book in the series. </p>

 <p> I liked the description of this book but I found the actual story lacking. Cody is a barhopping twink who earns a living by sleeping with the men he picks up in bars and Kirit is a dragon searching for his one true love. Of the two main characters, Cody was definitely more well rounded and sympathetic. Kirit never bothers to find out anything about the man he professes to love and alternates between ignoring him (after whisking him off to another dimension where he knows no one) and rushing in to their quarters for sex. Oh, he also likes to make sure everyone knows Cody is his mate by shouting MINE!! whenever he's actually with Cody and someone else gets too close. If that's love, give me chocolate. </p>
