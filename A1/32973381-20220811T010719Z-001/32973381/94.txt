<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> I bought this as a compromise, trying to find a good case/keyboard combination for my graduate studies.  I am looking for something to help with note taking in class and occasionally tracking ideas with a note program.  After looking at reviews for a couple weeks and not finding any items locally to try out, I decided to take a chance on this product.  I'm breaking down my review to various categories.BLUETOOTH: after using for nearly two hours right out of the box, I have not had any problems with connection and setting it up took less than a minute.  Can't complain about that at all.  Supposedly, the light will blink when the battery gets low.  I can't say this will happen, but for two hours without a charge I am satisfied with this part.KEYBOARD:  The keyboard is small, although I've never used one this small to be able to compare.  I still prefer to use a full size.  For this unit, there is no shift key on the right side.  That is an interesting adjustment to make and I wonder about how going back and forth could be.  There are also some shortcut keys that are specific to the iPad and could be useful in the long term for getting around.  The biggest problem I have found is that the keystrokes will double or triple for no reason without any user error.  This is a big annoyance if you are  like me and want to see what I type just as I waant it (that is an example of what happens).  keyboad is soft plastic, won't damage your screens, and provides a decent typing experience.  I like the click click experience,knowing I've pressed a button, etc.  This keyboad would be suitable for me.  There are some up-raised bars at the top of the keyboard between the logo and the connect button.  These work well for adjusting your viewing angle, but it's not their intention, and it's not a huge degree of separation.  I have found that using the touchscreen is a good experience as well, screen doesn't fall back, feels fairly well supported.  probably don't want to go using a lot of force though.FIT/DESIGN:  Some users have commented on the fit of this case.  I have a first gen iPad and had to cut some of the packaging foam to place inside the cover - this allows my ipad to sit high enough so that the entire screen is visible.  If you don't do this, you will lose visibility of maybe 1/4".  I don't call that a dealbreaker, but it tells me the gen 2 certainly won't fit well as it is thinner and will likely have lots of room to shift.  shouldn't fall out though.  I like the design of the case a lot, one of the reasons I went ahead with it.  the material has a nice smooth feel, holds the item well as far as keeping it in the case, and I like the sleek design that doesn't have all sorts of fancy bling.  I like simple.  I really like the magnetic close - doesn'tt interfere with anything on the unit.  There is a flap that closes on the unit, tucked in behind it, holding it in the sleeve.  It's about 2 inches long, more than enough to safely hold the unit in place.  magnetic flap folds underneath keyboard to raise for typing, very comfortable in my opinion.  Finer details, like stiching and symmetry, give the case away as a sort of "generic" item -  not very high quality and this makes this a $50 item as opposed to the $100 "MSRP." I can't see paying that much at any point for this item sight unseen.  I tried folding the keyboard back to use just the ipad - if you shut it off I think it would be functional this way because the keyboard is not hard plastic.  It's not designed for this type of use, so keep that in mind.OVERALL:  I like the idea and concept of this unit.  I think it falls short of the five star rating, obviously, and could use improvement.  I don't see that happening though and I am planning on returning this one.  Aside from the problems I've mentioned, mine arrived damaged so i am shipping it back for a refund and will go another direction.  I would love to see a full size keyboard/case design sometime, as I wouldn't mind the size and would prefer the functionality of a full size board and ease of carrying it in a single case.If you have any specific questions about the unit, just add a comment and I will respond when I see it.  Thanks. </p>

 <p> I purchased this product as a gift but had a chance to use it for a short time.  Overall the product works very well and the leather case is very nice and sturdy.  The buttons are rather small and take a bit of getting used to. </p>

 <p> Good product </p>

 <p> This was one of the only well reviewed cases I found for my first generation iPad. I recieved the product and found that  it was black leather rather than the brown pictured. The bezel around the screen when the iPad is on the case raises up, which doesn't do anything negative, except make the product look used or worn. The iPad sits well in the case and has various slits to adjust the angle, however, there is a little too much wiggle room in the case. This makes it so the iPad can slip a little too far down, resulting in a little bit of the bottom of the screen being covered up.Now onto the goods:The  keyboard is very nice and  easily connects via bluetooth. With waterproof keys there is no worry about spilling or cleaning. However, this silicone keyboard does lend to an interesting feel that is somewhere in between squishy and tactile. All I have to say is that it takes a bit of getting used to, but that's it. It has great battery  life and shortcuts for iPad specific functions, and near complete lack  of the typical  clacking sound.This is a very nice looking case with  a plush leather feel, it will also fit the newer iPads, I just hope they change the picture for future buyers. </p>

 <p> Works great with my Gen 1 iPad.  Very easy to setup, works as good as I had hoped.Uses a standard USB charging cable (not iPod/iPad).  Not sure how long the charge lasts on the keyboard, but through minimal usage, it has been working now for almost a week.Only cons:> I wish there was a way to modify the case so that the screen could be in portrait position while still able to use the keyboard.> iPad operations are intended for touch screen.  While the keyboard is a definite plus (now I consider this thing an essential), still many functions are only available to the touch screen> I would like it slightly better if there was a way to fold back the keyboard so that it isn't felt when the iPad is being used as an e-reader for example.  It isn't bad, but feels a bit awkward.The case is good.  A pocket for a stylus and business cards might make this a bit better for business users.  Love the feel and responsiveness of the keyboard.  It is a definite plus to have number keys and the ability to get at characters without switching modes on the onscreen keyboard.If it doubt, try this thing.  I highly doubt you will be disappointed. </p>

 <p> This is a great product. I got this thinking I could have a keyboard with my iPad whenever I type out some rather long documents.. the on-screen keyboard that comes built-in with the iPad is great, but not so much when you have to do some really lengthy typing work.Although this keyboard doesn't have the feel of a regular keyboard, I still like it. It is extremely value-for-money.I would totally recommend this product! </p>

 <p> This is the third time I am using this product for myself but I bought almost 6 of these.I earlier used this with first Ipad, fits well.But with the new Ipad2 it is lose i.e. oversize and I have to put some padding, but still its not as good as it was with original Ipad because you cannot see the complete screen of the IPAD2 in horizontal position which is a big irritant. Although when they sold they said this was good for new Ipad 2 which is not true.Product as such is robust and good, just the issue that the new Ipad2 does not snug well in this pocket and also it does not have a hole for the camera on the back of the IPAD2.They should not advertise on the Amazon site that this is for IPAD2 THIS IS MISREPRESENTATION OF FACTS!! Amazon should do something about this seller!! </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Excellent Product but incorrect version, NOT FOR IPAD2 </p>

 <p> Good quality for the price. Keyboard has a nice feel to it. Does add weight but worth it if you need to do a lot of typing. </p>

 <p> I got this for my iPad 2.  I needed to add a little padding to the bottom of the case to keep the 2 from slipping down too low in the case while in "laptop" mode, but it was overall an acceptable fit.  It doesn't feel like its rattling around or anything in there while I carry the case.  I was a little skeptical about this item since its the cheapest keyboard/case combo I could find, but gave it a chance.  I'm glad I did.  It adds a lot to the usefulness of the iPad, and has been reliable so far.  The keys have kind of a rubbery, mushy feel to them which is a small annoyance.  The biggest problem I had is the way they rearranged a few of the keys and dropped the right shift key.  Granted, they had to do something to get everything to fit in the limited space they had, but I think other keyboards have found a better way.  The case itself is made out of some vinyl like material, but it looks nice enough.  It's well padded but not too bulky, and has kind of a rectangular appearance.  The flap on the top makes removing the iPad fairly easy, but also holds it firmly in place.  I don't think I'd want to write any long papers with this, but its great for email, commenting on message boards, etc. </p>

 <p> Got this keyboard case for my new/discontinued HP TouchPad.  It makes for a little bulkier package than I'd like, but I got the keyboard charged & paired right away and am generally pleased so far.  Still very much learning, but the rubber keys are comfortable (you will see the same generic keyboard in virtually every case/keyboard combo) and seems well-made, w/ good tactile sense.  Hopefully no significant Bluetooth disconnect issues.  Only time will tell so far as this & battery life are concerned.  The case is black, and anyone expecting Prada or Coach quality will be disappointed.  The case smells like leather, at least, and is nicely padded.  My only problems are that the case doesn't allow the TouchPad to lean back as I'd like, and as said, it's a bit bulky.  But altogether I got a very low-cost quality tablet with some added versatility. </p>

 <p> Although the photo shows a brown cover, I received a black one which is what I prefer. This will work with both iPad1 and iPad2. I have both and I'm glad I don't have to buy separate keyboards to use my devices. As one reviewer mentioned, there is no hole for the camera if you have an iPad2 but that is not important to me. If I want to take a picture with my iPad2, it would be no problem taking it out of the cover. There is a flap on top of the device slot that tucks inside to keep it from falling out. Since the iPad2 is thinner, it also helps to keep it more stable and not shift around. Syncing with bluetooth was quick and simple. There is an on/off toggle switch and a button to activate bluetooth. The included instruction sheet is pretty straightforward. The keyboard arrived powered up and there is a USB cord for recharging. As for typing, I tried it on different notetaking apps and it works for each one. The keys are softer than I am used to but they are responsive. The material on the case is soft and not cheap looking. I think the purchasers who gave bad reviews got defective products which is too bad. The downside is I will need two cords to recharge my iPad and to recharge the keyboard. I need to get a dual USB charger that iPad will work with to use as my travel back-up. Good value. </p>

 <p> Works with iPad1 and 2! </p>
