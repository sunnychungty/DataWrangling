 <p> I enjoyed reading this story. Although I have to admit I skimmed some of the conversations of the non-main characters. I like Angela Verdenius in general. </p>

 <p> The characters are real, convincing and adorable. Bree is a big beautiful woman, independent, beliefs that makes some raise eyebrows. Nick is a soldier, true stubborn and protective alpha male.The dialog made me laugh, it is fun, witty, clever as they work through they issues, learn to compromise, and fall in love.The romance is sweet and steamy, makes you *swoon*!And it is always a pleasure to catch up with the characters from the previous books.Even though the books are written as series, all of them can be read as stand-alone books. These are the best BBW books on the market I have read, and can recommend all of them! </p>

 <p> Another home run from Angela Verdenius! </p>

 <p> I am a sucker for anything to do with military love stories and throw in a BBW, you can't go wrong with this story. This is a sweet book and though it dragged just a LITTLE Little bit, this book is still worth the purchase. </p>

 <p> Thoroughly enjoyed the latest novel from this author. I read it one sitting and when I put it down all I could think was.....can't wait for her next one!Her female heroine is spunky and witty. I enjoyed the verbal exchanges with the hero and had a few LOL moments. The plot is quirky but the strong main character development doesn't make it too out there. It's nice that the author ties in characters ( Alex Lawson and his love) from  her prior novels. It gives the reader a chance to &#34;check in&#34; on how they've been doing since their &#34;happily ever after ending&#34; </p>

 <p> Her books keep getting better & better !! </p>

 <p> Another great book by Angela.  This one is about  Bree  who speaks her mind before thinking about her words, and a UFO hunter. And Nick a soldier, true stubborn and protective. He has been receiving letters from his Goodbye Girl and is due to either leave the service or reenlist. He decides to find her and when he does the &#34;sparks&#34; fly. Such a great love story with a different twist to it.I love how the characters have some connection to the characters from Angela's other  BBW books.Read them I think you will enjoy them. I know I do and can't wait for the next one to come out. </p>

 <p> Another Winner! </p>

 <p> Another great story from Angela Verdenius.  I've become quite a fan of her BBW books and how they always tie into previous characters.  It makes you feel like family.  The dynamic and banter is so natural and a real talent that Ms Verdenius possesses.  I always look anxiously forward to her next book. </p>

 <p> The PremiseAussie soldier Sergeant Nick Mason looks forward to getting letters from The Goodbye Girl, a woman who chooses a soldier without a family to correspond with during their time overseas.  But now Nick&#8217;s going home, and he receives her usual goodbye letter, and traditionally Nick should pass her along to the next lonely soldier - but he can bring himself to do that.  So he sets out in search of the Goodbye Girl, but he&#8217;s surprised by what he finds out.Bree is the Goodbye Girl, and she&#8217;s recently moved to a little town in Australia (which happens to be the town that Nick&#8217;s visiting his friend Alex.  Bree doesn&#8217;t expect to meet Nick, ever.  But she does, and he&#8217;s not going to let her go.My ThoughtsI liked Nick and Bree. He&#8217;s protective without being smothering, she&#8217;s independent yet not obstinately so. She&#8217;s always had to take care of herself so it takes a while for her to adjust to Nick&#8217;s concern for her. I liked seeing Alex and Harly (the H/h from a previous book). I always enjoy visiting the little &#8216;vers Ms. Verdenius has created, and seeing old characters can add to the story without overwhelming the current narrative.  The UFO angle is different, and I like that Bree is more in the vein of a Fox Mulder - she wants to believe, but she&#8217;s not going to be a fool.  Their attraction is more on the sweet than blazingly hot side, but I enjoyed it all the same.  Yes, Bree is a BBW, but it&#8217;s not the only thing that defines her, which I liked.The Bottom LineSweet romance with a touch of the paranormal, I enjoyed it and I&#8217;ll continue to buy Ms. Verdenius&#8217; books </p>

 <p> After reading the sample I didn't think I would like this book. Don't get me wrong I love quirky and out the box novels but aliens and UFOs are not really my thing. Since I had already read the sample and get a little involved in the story, I went ahead and purchased it. I actually liked it though. Bree had me cracking up throughout the entire book. Just her interaction with everyone she came in contact with and the back and forth banter and flirting between her and Nick..I liked it!! :) </p>

 <p> I love this story and the author. It is sexy and funny. Her sense of humor is great and each story can stand alone, but reading them all is so much better. My friends have started this series and are loving it. </p>

 <p> It's been a while since a book literally made me laugh but this one did and I enjoyed it so much.  I liked the characters and the story line but the best part was the dialog.  Nice to see a female lead that was quirky and comfortable with it. </p>

 <p> This book is a perfect continuation of this series! I love the fact that Bee the main heroine is into UFOs. It adds a great twist to the story! Angela Verdenius is one of my favorite authors! I can't wait for more from her! </p>

 <p> Another home run! </p>

 <p> This could have been so much better, if it hadn't been so dreadfully boring! It was a story about nothing. Nothing, no emotion, hardly any connection and very little that actually happens. I don't remember the previous books in this series being so boring, so something just seemed to go off here. It could have been about two people falling in love, despite the huge differences in their lives, the distance, the separation, the beliefs, but no, alien and UFO chasing was the horse that was beaten to death here. Over and over again. The dialogue was so awkward, neither the H nor the h sounded real, it was as if this book was written with the purpose of putting me to sleep and it did. The worst part of this book was the Hero, he was so perfect he was boring too, and his role in the story was simply not enough to sustain my interest, almost like the non-hero of chick-lit. These books are quite formulaic and I am disappointed but it is time for me to stop reading this author's books. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> 1.5 stars, a struggle to read this utterly boring book. </p>
