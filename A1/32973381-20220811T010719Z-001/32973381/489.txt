 <p> Divorce is a very difficult thing to deal with for the husband and wife.  While I always believe there is a second chance to try to fix the relationship, if you must go through a divorce with children, this book has some wonderful advice on how to handle the difficult situation.  Informative read, I recommend it. </p>

 <p> My friend recently got divorced and we picked up Divorce with Children by Lisa McGinley. Her kids really suffer from her divorce and we went through the book to find some usable solutions that she could apply ASAP to make her kids feel better. Luckily we found some great advice to make the pain and the confusion a little bit lighter. We love about the book that it provides easy and quick solutions. The advice is very practical and easy to implement. She already applied some of the guidance from the book with good results so the methods are very effective. I hightly recommend the book. </p>

 <p> I have a bachelors degree in child psychology and development and let me tell you that it is very important to be sensitive to the emotional changes that children go through during a divorce or a separation. Far too often the kids get caught up in the emotional distress of the parents when a marriage ends. That can cause emotional distress and create broken family bonds. This book is a good resource for parents as they approach this time of their lives while keeping the needs of their children a top priority. </p>

 <p> Great resource for parents </p>

 <p> This is such a great book. The author, Lisa gives wonderful advice on how to talk to your children when you and your spouse are going through a divorce. It is very important to put your children first so they do not resent you later on. She gives you advice on what to talk to your kids about and how to help them get through this divorce, because it really does affect not only you, but your children as well. I highly recommend this book to anyone going through a divorce! </p>

 <p> This book saved our family. It didn't prevent the divorce, but it made us realize how traumatic it could be on our children, and how to take steps to lessen and even alleviate their stress and pain over the breakup. Their mother and I actually get along even better now than we did when they were married, and the kids have definitely noticed! Highly recommended! </p>

 <p> I wish this little book had been around several years ago when I needed it.  Somehow, I managed to get most of it right - but, oh, how this little book would have paved the way a little - for me, for their dad, and, most of all, for our kids.  Good job, Lisa. </p>

 <p> Unfortunately, when parents go through a divorce, it's the children who suffer the most.  They are stuck in the middle feeling the pain and confusion of what just happened.  This was a quick, easy to read guide in which the author provides practical advice to help cope with these tough and trying times in a manner that can be easily, and effectively applied.  Highly recommended.Sincerely, Terry Thompson (author ofLeadership Is: A Developmental Leadership Guide to Personal and Professional Success,Push Start: A Practical Guide to Jumpstart Your Life From Average to Awesome,What it takes to become a MENTOR, andLeadership Solved) </p>
