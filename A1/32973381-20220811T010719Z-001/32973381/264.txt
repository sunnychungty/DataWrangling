 <p> Okay so Street Fighter might not be up there with HARD TARGET but it has its moments and sometimes delivers a laugh amongst the carnage. Timecop and Hard Target are easily worth the price of the set and The Quest was another good vehicle for Van Damme. An excellent choice if you are looking for some great action movies. </p>

 <p> I bought this set specifically because I wanted a widescreen version of "Timecop," and I'm happy to say that the print quality in both sound and visual is excellent.  "Hard Target" looks just as good as it does on the previous DVD release.  These two films are easily the best of the Jean-Claude Van Damme features, with solid acting, plot, effects, and action.  Just these two films alone makes the set worthwhile.  However, the lesser-known "Quest" is great martial arts fun of the same stripe as "Bloodsport" or "Enter the Dragon," where the hero has to fight a bunch of other martial artists in a tournament."Street Fighter" is the weakest of the bunch.  If it were a B-grade action flick, the straight-to-cable kind like you used to see on "Monstervision" or the off hours of Cinemax, it would be fine.  However, the movie is completely unfocused, and the obvious ill health of Raul Julia is uncomfortable.  Because it was supposed to be big budget with pretty big names for 1994, it's not fun like so many B-grade mid-1990s action films are.  It's just bad, but it's no reason not to buy this set.  Skip "Street Fighter" and go straight to the other 3 films.  You won't regret it. </p>

 <p> Let's get this out of the way: The worst movie of the foursome is Street Fighter.  A movie about a video game based entirely on a fighting tournament, that doesn't have a fighting tournament, is a horrible idea.  The acting, the script, the action, all are very bad.  One of JCVD's worst movies.  Having said that...Timecop is superb.  It's Back to the Future without the G rating.  Tons of action and the typical JCVD elements.Hard Target is JCVD's foray into the John Woo world, where everything from a cigar to a snake gets a spinning kick.  It's over the top, but still pretty awesome.The Quest is absolutely lights out.  Tons of similarities to video games, movies, and other fighting genre concepts, this one just rocks.  It's basically a hyper repeat of the movie that put JCVD on the map: Bloodsport.This is a very worthwhile quadruple feature.  Watch the three good ones and enjoy them, then watch Street Fighter and play Mystery Science Theater 3000. </p>

 <p> And it's about bloody time.My only purpose in writing this review is to confirm that at long last, we have a Region 1 version of Timecop in true anamorphic widescreen format. If, like me, you've been waiting for it for years, then I guess that'll be good news to you. </p>

 <p> Timecop in widescreen at last! </p>

 <p> This four pack of movies is definately for fans of Van Damme!  The best movie of this set is Timecop, then Hard Target, followed by The Quest and Street Fighter.  There are some great fight scenes in the Timecop and Hard Target, but if you've never seen Bloodsport (a must see), The Quest is very similar to that in a cheaper way.  Street Fighter is one of thoose video game to movies, enough said!  Very enjoyable if you are a fan of Van Damme or you watch it with friends! </p>

 <p> I bought this DVD for my son; he loves it. It's great to have four movies on one disk. I also think these old movies are more appropriate, with less sexual content, less bad language, and a clear right and wrong, with the good guy fighting for justice. </p>

 <p> Jean Claude Van Damme brings to the screen a combination of 007 adventure andscience fiction.  I sat glued to my chair and watched all four films on four different days.  It is really amazing how one man can portray over and over againwhat it means to be a fighter again evil whether it is today, yesterday, ortommorow.  This type of film is not for everyone; but, it certainly, filled anitch in my viewing habits; so, if you enjoy good against evil stories watch thisaction pack with four films in it. </p>

 <p> Any movie where Jean Claude Van Damme has a mullet or travels through time is good in my book.  Timecop is actually not that bad a movie as I remember.  Hard Target is also good but Street Fighter looked silly to me.  I'm not in grade school so all of those movies like Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter don't have the same effect on me.  The Quest looked dumb and it didn't hold my attention so I just turned it off.Overall, this is a good buy and its def worth the price. </p>

 <p> Worth it for TIMECOP and HARD TARGET... </p>

 <p> I gotta say... I am very happy I bought this set... I did buy it primarily to get Timecop in widescreen... and I admit I was apprehensive about this... Frankly, I was afraid they would take the full screen version and simply cut off the top and bottom, like so many companies have done to "create" a widescreen version of their movies... but this version is true 2:35:1 widescreen AND it is dual layer and very good quality - even on the big screen plasma! I haven't watched the other films in the set yet, but I don't care... Timecop is excellent and finally it is here in widescreen... I recommend this highly and say thanks to the people who decided to give us true quality for the money we spent on this! </p>

 <p> Finally - TIMECOP in true widescreen! </p>

 <p> This is a 2 disc set. First disc consists of TimeCop  and Hard Target. Second disc consists of Street Fighter and The Quest. Hard Target and TimeCop are really good movies. Timecop is a futuristic movie. Hard Target is full of action. One of Van Damme's best. Unfortunately, Street Fighter and The Quest are a total disappointment. The directing and acting are awful. Street fighter, based on one of the most successful games in history--Street Fighter II-- does not follow the actual game script and the special effects are terrible. Most of the characters do not exhibit their powers with the exception of Bison. Copcom did a terrible job with special effects here. The Quest has really bad acting. It is a really bad version of Van Damme's first big movie BloodSport. It is basically about an international fighting contest. I give The Quest thumbs down all the way. The movies have no scene menus which is not good. There are no selection of scenes allowed. </p>

 <p> Should be called double feature... </p>

 <p> Time Cop is the best of the four, Hard Target is next.  The other two are mediocre.Not Van Damme's best collection.Buy used at the lowest price. </p>
