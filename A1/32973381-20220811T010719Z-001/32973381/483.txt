 <p> What a great book! I wasn't sure what to think when I started reading this one, but I quickly found myself turning the pages as quick as I could. It read so much more like a novel than most of the stories I read from this genre! It was not all about spankings and domestic discipline with a little story thrown in. It was a great story that ALSO had spankings and domestic discipline.  It centered on a military couple going through an extremely tough time in their lives! You will really care about them!! I loved Shelby and Dean's relationship, even though it was most definitely rocky. I also loved all of the scenes with their son, Morgan in them. Anyone who has raised teenage sons will appreciate how accurate the portrayal was! Well worth the read! </p>

 <p> This story opens your eyes a little to how military career individuals have to adjust to civilian life. The authors develops the characters so you can relate with them. </p>

 <p> I love a military hero, they are so strong, sexy and dominant. Dean, Dinah's hero in Sir, Yes Sir, does not disappoint. This hero is a bit broken however, and carries the baggage you would expect in his situation. He has to learn how to be a civilian again, as well as a husband and father. Dean has a difficult time adjusting and finds he must learn how to bend and to grow personally in order to keep his family together. He also learns its okay for him to lean on and trust his woman to make that happen. A tumultuous story, a tearjerker at times so have some tissue handy. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The character growth of the male lead was what made it for me. I really didn't like him at first, but he grew on my and by the end I had fallen for him. </p>

 <p> Dean has retired from the Army due to an accident. He has become bitter and everyone feels it. His wife, Shelby and his son, Morgan are becoming strangers to him. If he doesn't do something quick, he'll lose them both. He is keeping a secret that could cause everything to change. He has let Shelby take the full workload and doesn't see her patience is running thin.Shelby is trying to be the understanding wife and take care of Dean but it quickly become more than she can take. When she offered a promotion at work, she knows she has to take it because her family is desperate for the money. Hiding a secret that could change everything as well, she struggles with whether or not to tell Dean and how he will react to the news.Sir Yes Sir was an inspiring story for me. My heart went out to Shelby as I quickly became invested in this story and it's characters. Watching Dean and Shelby struggle to keep their relationship afloat, seeing their son Morgan going through his own personal hell, and watching as Shelby struggled to maintain her role as the supportive wife. I love this story and gave it 5 stars because it's not your typical erotic romance. The characters are more invested and their is more of a buildup.Sir Yes Sir will keep you rooting for Dean and Shelby until it's final pages. I recommend it for anyone needing a strong romance that will help to tear down your emotional walls. Dinah McLeod wrote a beautiful story that is strongly relatable. </p>

 <p> When you read a book of Dinah McLeod it's like she is sitting next to you and is reading her story just for you. Intimate, but not just in the sexy sense of the word, but intimate like in Close. You feel close to all of her persona's. In the fist two chapters you can completely identify with Shelby who is trying to keep her family together. Just in time we get to know the Colonel, a tough retired Army man who is having trouble getting used to civilian life. After that follows one hell of spanking scene. There may not be many spanking scenes in this book. but the spanking scenes that can be found in the book are so hot! I read one of the scenes out loud to my wife and even bought a bath brush to copy the scene from the book :-) O, my.Dinah is &#8211; and I hope always will be &#8211; a genuine storyteller. She tells the story of Shelby and Dean, her husband and their teenage son so wonderful I wish would you to read it too. I thinks she deserves a six star ranking for this one.Thank you Dinah. </p>

 <p> I enjoyed this book a lot. This is my second book by this author. I loved the military aspect of the book as well as the DD angle. I, also have two children born far apart, almost 13 years apart. I can relate to the whole &#34;starting over&#34; issue. Short, easy read. </p>

 <p> I'll admit at first I was a bit upset with Dean and his attitude toward Shelby and Morgan especially we he got on them for not respecting him.  But as the story unfolds and you get beneath the surface there is so much more to all of the characters.  And you see Dean really begin to make an effort.  This story is really about the whole family and not just the couple.  The ending is wonderful and worth the journey to get there. </p>

 <p> I absolutely loved this book. Dinah McLeod has such wonderful insight. Dean is a strong but broken man, Morgan is a strong woman who finds ways to help Dean to heal. I hope there is a sequel because I want to read more about Cara, the nurse who needs healing. There is growth of both characters which is how a book should be, otherwise it would be undeveloped. </p>

 <p> As this story begins, we meet Shelby and Dean.  Dean had an accident while in the Army and chooses to retire rather than take a desk job.  Shelby and Dean are a little lost by the abrupt change.  As a retired military wife myself, I can understand.  And, even though she is a submissive wife, Shelby has had to deal with her husband being gone for long periods of time by taking charge of their family life.  I really enjoyed this story.  Dinah McLeod does a great job of character development and letting us know the inner mind of the characters.  That being said, I really did not like Dean in the beginning.  He is cold and distant.  Then, secrets are told and Shelby and Dean start to come together again.  Their 17 year old son, Morgan, is also struggling, mainly because he doesn&#8217;t feel that his father loves him for who he is.  Then, Shelby is unexpectedly hospitalized and Dean has to step up to the plate and become the HOH that he is supposed to be.  I only gave 4 stars because, once again, this is a wonderful story with very little spanking.  I really expect more than 2 spankings in a story labeled as a spanking story. </p>

 <p> Mmmm! What's not to love about a man in uniform?? Of course, and Yes, sir? Please, sir? Dean is a man I could fall in love with every day- even if he is carrying a huge load on his shoulders. Times are tough for this small family, and a man needs to lead his family. Dinah mastered Dean's character! Although I'm pretty sure he would be highly offended to hear me say so. Then there is Shelby, sweet Shelby, doing her best to be a good wife and understand her man. She's willing to carry more than her share, why she's been doing that for years, that is what army wives do. It's a given. But what they're doing-- isn't what they had in mind, that's the problem, their whole life has been thrown off kilter. Dinah is an amazing story crafter and I'll read her books every day if she'd write that fast. This is another bestseller by my standards. </p>

 <p> Shelby and Dean Davis are a very touching couple.Dean, the hunky ex-military man come's into the story a bit of a broken man. We immediately see what a levelheaded, supportive, and loving wife Shelby is. Their lives have recently gone from structural Army life, to make do civilians. Shelby works at a local Dairy Queen and Dean is still dancing around his guilt, offering little support to his family. I actually didn't like Dean in the beginning of this story. He struck me as a very selfish man.There was a point in the story when I almost didn't think the author was going to be able to redeem this man, but she did so beautifully. Guilt is an emotion that eats at people from the inside out, and Dean carried his hard. I loved the scene in this book that caused Dean to truly evaluate himself. It was very touching and I would elaborate but that would spoil the moment for those who haven't yet read this delightfully touching story.Shelby is an astounding wife and mother. She's keen to see what's going on under the surface with her family, but wisely chooses when to speak and when not too. One day at work, she gets an unexpected surprise that turns out to be just the life changing event they all needed. When Shelby is unexpected hospitalized, Dean turns into a new man. He and Morgan mend the rift in their relationship, his job is going well, and he has meaning in his life again.The family grows close again once Shelby comes home and the touching little surprise at the end will leave a tear in your eye wishing there were more.There's a tiny little part in this story where Miss McLeod leaves us hanging. Cara, the nurse that Shelby becomes close with has a conversation with her husband that Shelby can't help but overhear and the side she heard didn't sound good. She wants to reach out to her friend but the timing is bad, she's just getting ready to leave the hospital.Is there a story with Cara and Kevin coming soon? yes? </p>

 <p> SIR, YES SIR by Dinah McLeod was a beautifully written story of Domestic Discipline. It was not over the top with the DD and the entire story was interesting.  I really like the interaction between Dean and Shelby and even their son Morgan.  Dean had to retire early from his career in the Army and he is bitter about it.  Shelby being the typical Army spouse has basically raised their son alone and being very active in the FRG.  Morgan feels his father doesn't care about him.  I look forward to reading more books by Dinah McLeod! </p>

 <p> Although I'm a fan of Old-fashioned husband stories, switching from Dean's perspective to Shelby's perspective was a little unsettling to me. I think it interrupted the flow of the story. I'd rather the story be told from one perspective. I applaud the different approach but for me, it didn't work as well as most other stories.A complimentary copy was provided by the author for an honest review. </p>

 <p> This book was okay for me. It seemed a little slow at first until you understood the history of what happened to Dean. After the truth came out, the story really started to develope. I would have liked, and thought that there would have been more spankings. </p>

 <p> As always Dinah delivers a wonderful story. Shelby, Dean, and Morgan definitely deliver a mix for a good story. Den is a military career man, Shelby his wife has always been a sty at one kind of woman because of Dean&#8217;s career. Morgan the young man determined to be himself and not a carbon copy of his dad.Dean leaves the military but not of his own accord. Going from years of military to sudden civilian life is a huge change for all of them, but the son Morgan seems to have adjusted best. Dean is a dominant man who must learn to be not only dominant but soft when it requires it. He must learn to connect with Shelby and Morgan all over again.This story will lead the reader through a gallant of emotions and ranges. The spanking in it is just as good as the rest of the story. I enjoyed this tale and look forward to more of Dinah&#8217;s wonderful stories. </p>
