<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Shocking expose on the ill effects of Black Popular Culture and Meth on Southern Whites. </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> The FP pulls the curtain back on a white subculture that elites at The New York Times would never deign to acknowledge. Following the story of Jtro and his crew you can't help but feel for their plight. Uneducated and with no future, their only release is getting drunk and gaining sexual market value through displays of competence at Beat Beat Revelation. When the town's liquor store is controlled by a rival gang, residents of Frazier Park must either comply with the gang's demands, or seek escapism through Meth. This sets up the conflict for our hero, Jtro, and we all learn how to truly be Never Ignorant, at Getting Goals Accomplished. Who WILL feed the ducks, yo? INDEED. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> There are times when a movie is so absurd, so ridiculous, and so over the top that you can't help but enjoy it. The movies that never take themselves too seriously yet at the same time are the perfect mix of campy cheesiness and straight shooting acting; the ones that may have initially bombed at the box office, but have gained a cult following since its release on Blu-ray, DVD, or even VHS. Full length features that may be seen as a failure in the eyes of reception and criticism, but you are a huge fan of; no matter if that's a closet fan, a shy one, or one that screams their admiration of said feature from the heavens. "The FP" fully embraces all of that and never tries to be something it's not, which is perhaps one of the reasons it's as good as it is.It takes a few minutes for this ludicrous concept to really sink in. A gang war centered on Dance Dance Revolution; that's basically what you're looking at here. Once you're able to accept that that is actually happening; the movie is a hell of a lot of fun. The movie is driven by its endless amount of references to 80s movies and its insane dialogue. Aside from Art Hsu, these are some of the whitest guys you've ever come across and yet they speak some of the most ghetto, street dialect you've ever heard.Most of the stuff said in the film can't be repeated here. The F word is used over 250 times, but that only helps add to the humor of the movie. When KCDC first pulls JTRO back to The FP, he gives him the most ridiculous pep talk in the world: drunks have turned to meth in his absence because L Dubba E now controls all the alcohol in town. No drunks means no bums and no bums means that no one will feed the ducks down at the park. A town without ducks is nothing. The movie essentially revolves around restoring alcohol to the people, gaining enough street cred to be respected, and bringing ducks back to the town.Everything is so outrageous that you can't help but laugh. At one point, KCDC says that gats are like toothpaste - just in case. Later, KCDC offers JTRO a Spaghetti-O waffle sandwich. Then there's the shoot out where BLT (Nick Principe) is taking cover behind a toilet and the two training montages that are a blatant homage to "Rocky." "The FP" is really, really funny. It's also incredible with how many movies it may remind you of. It's like "The Warriors" meets "The Road Warrior," "Rocky," and "The Karate Kid" with a score influenced by John Carpenter."The FP" obviously isn't going to be for everyone. It's very silly, but in the right light is pretty great. It's the type of movie that has to be seen to believed; one that you're endlessly showing to friends because they give you that stupid look when you tell them about its concept. Given its extremely low budget, it's amazing the movie looks as good as it does. The lighting is phenomenal, the sets highlight its post-apocalyptic type atmosphere, and the score is way better than it should be. It's as if "The FP" knew ahead of time that it would become a cult classic long before it was even released. "The FP" is so absurd that it's brilliant.Special features on the Blu-ray release of the film include Never Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished The Making of The FP (around 21.5 minutes in length), audio commentary by The Trost brothers, Costume Designing The FP (8 minutes), Scoring The FP (6 minutes), The FP in The FP (10.5 minutes), the green band trailer, the red band trailer, and a 16-page booklet featuring introductions by directors Rob Zombie, Mark Neveldine, and Brian Taylor.The Making of feature is really cool. Brandon Trost reveals that they purposely made "The FP" reference familiar films from the 80s so you could still understand what was going on even if you couldn't understand the crazy dialogue. Influences for the film include "Rocky," "The Warriors," "The Karate Kid," John Carpenter, "8 Mile," Double Dragon, Street Fighter, "The Road Warrior," and "Waterworld." The Trost brothers shot the majority of the movie on their dad's property and would steal junk to make their sets and despite the tight budget were able to make the production value feel much bigger."The FP" is now available on single disc DVD and single disc Blu-ray from Drafthouse Films. The Blu-ray is presented in 1080p HD with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and DTS-HD MA 5.1 or 5.1 Dolby Digital sound. It's rated R for pervasive language, sexual content, some nudity, and brief drug material and is around 83 minutes in length. </p>

 <p> I bought this movie on a whim, mostly because I'm in the process of buying the entire Drafthouse Films collection. I'm weird like that. I live in Austin, so I had seen The FP be advertised around town when it was originally released. I skipped it because, quite frankly, it looked silly. I regret my decision. The FP is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It's hilarious. But it's also a pretty good movie. It has an interesting plot, but it's so self-aware. It is my opinion that the FP has the best final scene in any movie ever. Do yourself a favor, watch this movie. It's worth every penny. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Blu-ray Review: "The FP" </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> How one independent film can mix together a dance culture satire lampooning everything from "Breakin'" to "Step Up" with the feel good attitude of "Rocky" and "The Karate Kid" while topping it off with a pinch of "The Road Warrior" and "Class of 1984" is beyond me. However, one movie successfully does just this. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to "The FP."In the not-so-distant future, Frazier Park, CA is overrun by alcoholics in a land where consumption of the drink is limited and they've turned to meth and other drugs for their fixes. Two gangs now run the streets of the apocalyptic city. They settle their disputes through a dangerous street-level version of the video game "Dance, Dance, Revolution." Only one will be left standing when the gangs clash against each other and decide their fates playing "Beat, Beat Revelation!"Words can't possibly describe how literally ridiculous this movie is. They also can't describe how fun it is. I couldn't stop smiling the entire time. The urban street lingo flowing out of the white and Asian characters' mouths is laugh-out-loud hilarious. Everything in this movie feels like the result of a car wreck between the dance, new wave, redneck, and punk cultures of the 1980s and 1990s. How the actors played their roles straight-faced is beyond me.The high definition transfer of the film hasn't drained the film of any of its personality. It still hangs on to its independent flavor and spirit. The 5.1 Dolby Digital surround sound pumps the electronic score out in your face as the dance contests and training sequences get fiercer and fiercer.The producers of this Blu-ray release went all out for its special features. There's a 20-minute behind-the-scenes featurette entitled "Never Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished: The Making of 'The FP'" and two others as well. Audio commentary is provided by the Trost Brothers, who directed the film. A featurette entitled "'The FP' in the FP: A Return to Frazier Park" shows the cast and crew promoting a special screening of the movie in the town it was named after. Green band and red band trailers are included. There's also a 16-page booklet that features pictures from the movie and introductions by directors Rob Zombie ("Halloween"), Mark Neveldine ("Crank"), and Brian Taylor ("Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance")."The FP" is something to behold in its Blu-ray version. I guarantee you've never seen a movie like it. I've never witnessed a film that perfectly captures the decline of Western civilization while simultaneously being inspirational. Rob Zombie said it best when he described it as "'The Karate Kid' starring Snake Plissken versus white trash Clubber Lang against the backdrop of 'The Warriors' set to a bumping disco John Carpenter soundtrack in the world of 'Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo.'" Enough said, yo! </p>

 <p> If this is some sort of student film (which is the way it feels) and I were the instructor that had to grade it, I would give it a solid B.  I would say in my notes "It's not good enough to be on Blu-Ray, DVD or even Netflix, but it's a promising start.  You'll do better next time".If this is some sort of effort made by mainstream producers (I'm not sure of that, but just assuming), this is a great looking film.  The photography is awesome.And...that's all I can say that's good about it.Worse still, it is on Blu-Ray, DVD and Netflix.So, this is a comedy based on the Bemani games of a decade ago (not exactly topical).  Where do I...uh...laugh?  When the nutty Asian guy says an F-bomb (according to IMDB there are 250 of those)?  A guy dies trying to keep up with the little arrows?  All the over the top mimicry of a cheap version of gangsta war film?Jason?  Jason?!!  Hello?  Where do I laugh?  Is there an area of this film that has humor?  Can you point them out?  Maybe a laugh track so I know when to start giggling?  How about a visual cue like the screen flashes, or an audio cue like the horn of an Edsel?Some compare this film to an Ed Wood masterpiece like Plan 9 From Outer Space or one of his troubled teen films.  Sorry, those were entertaining.  The FP is just not entertaining.  This movie is just a waste of time.  There are better films of this comedy genre that has at least one big laugh.  I don't even crack a smile with this one.Even National Lampoon's cheap, awful, straight-to-video comedies of the last few years (of which there have been, like, ten thousand or so) have more yuks than this film. World Trade Center has more belly laughs than this film.  Platoon is hysterical compared to...well, you get the idea.So if you want to just be rebellious and buy this film because of "haters" like me (I don't really care enough about it to hate it), go for it.  But your money is better spent on actual comedy. </p>

 <p> Words almost can't describe how much I love this movie. The FP IS what Lost Skeleton of Cadavra TRIES to be: A genre spoof that manages to be hilariously funny without winking at the camera or visibly trying too hard (the best example I can think of to describe the difference is this: if the makers of Lost Skeleton had made The FP, JTRO's eyepatch would have constantly switched eyes).But enough about that. The FP evokes, very strongly and deliberately, the kind of shabby direct-to-video post-apocalypse films that saw a meteoric rise in the 80s. If you ever had an experience of watching those movies with friends, and making fun of the ridiculousness on the screen, then odds are you're gonna dig The FP.G Dubba E, out! </p>

 <p> What's a town without ducks?With this and many other now immortalized lines this film became an instant cult classic.  The world this film creates has to be seen to be believed and it is sold 100% by everyone involved.  Watch it yourself and then put it on for some friends without telling them what it is about.  In the opening sequence they will be bewildered and think they are watching some funky 80's flick and then the magic that is "The FP" reveals itself and you are either a believer or not.  No spoilers here.  I just wish the cover didn't give something away that is better left as a surprise.  This film is best enjoyed with no knowledge of what you are going into.  It's not for everyone as there is a lot of profanity and vulgarity in the movie.  Characters definitely have their own manner of speaking too.  The humor of this film is awesome and the closing shot was great.  There are no films to really compare this to.  It stands and dances on its own. </p>

 <p> When I first saw the trailer for THE FP and learned what it was about I could only do one thing. I laughed. Hard and loud. Are you for real? A post apocalyptic film where gangs fought one another for possession of turf by...dance dance revolution?Much of THE FP seems like something that would come out of a Troma film. That's a compliment, not an insult. The production values are low budget but you can't really tell because the film looks that good. There is little to no money coming along to rescue this film so it all depends on the effort made by those involved. That effort is tremendous.As I said, the film takes place in what appears to be the near future, a world where everyone seems to do little more than get drunk and celebrate their heroes, those who face off in dance dance revolution. If you don't know what ddr is it's the game where to contestants stand on a platform made of squares and must imitate the patterns appearing on the screen making dance moves in the process.The main hero is Btro, a player who has yet to be beaten. His brother Jtro (Jason Trost) is also a competitor but not near the player Btro is. On a fateful night, Btro is facing L Dubba E, the winner taking control of the FP (short for Frazier Park where the film takes place). During the competition Btro has a heart attack and Jtro swears to never ddr again.A year later and we find Jtro working a road crew. His friend KCDC comes to him and tells him they need his help. L Dubba E has taken control of the liquor store and now the drunks are limited to meth instead of getting drunk. KCDC pleads his case to Jtro telling him the drunks no longer feed the ducks in the local lake. "Do you know what it's like to have a lake with no ducks?" he screams? Ok so that should tell you how funny this movie can get.Jtro returns home and KCDC helps him by getting him to the toughest trainer ever, BLT. BLT doesn't pull punches and hold Jtro up to his own high standards. He knows Btro was the best there ever was but also knows that Jtro has the potential to replace him. In a series of Rocky inspired montages we witness Jtro in training. But can he beat L Dubba E?Along the way we have a touch of romance tossed in as well. Jtro's long lost love Stacy is glad he has returned as well. A heavy drinker with a father she hates, Stacy has always hoped for a way to be noticed. Jtro gives her that chance. Don't misunderstand though. Stacy is as far from a fairy princess as you can get with a reputation for various sexual acts, one of which closes the film as it fades to black.I know, you're probably scratching your head thinking I've gone insane to recommend a movie that sounds like this. Had I not watched it I would have thought the same thing. But with the low expectations I had as it began I was astounded by how much heart was put into this thing. It also provided me some great belly laughs that I hadn't had much chance to expel in some time.This movie is definitely not for everyone. Those with a sense of adventure or looking for something different will love it. Those who admire Troma films will love it. Those who look for anything off the wall will love it. All others beware. You just might find yourself laughing at the most inappropriate things. </p>

 <p> When Albert Camus wrote of the absurdity of man, he could never have fathomed the FP.  This is the most wonderfully absurb movie I have ever seen.  If you attempt to take it seriously, you will hate it.  If you are capable of taking it seriously, seek professional help.  The plot surrounds a young man, JTRO, who lives in a semi-post-apocolyptic (or merely post-recession?) northern California town, Frazier Park (aka "the FP").  There, rival gangs must compete in "Beat Beat Revelation" (aka "Dance-Dance-Revolution") for their street cred.  After the death of his brother, JTRO leaves the FP and seeks employment in the logging industry, because "Logs is chill".  When the heir to the only liquor store in town brokers alchohol to only those who will comply with his gang's demands, JTRO must return in the name of justice to set things right.  So be Never Ignorant and Get Goals accomplished, settle in with a spaghetti-O and waffle sandwich, and watch "The FP".  Turn on the subtitles - the spelling of the dialog is half the the fun.  Dayum! </p>
