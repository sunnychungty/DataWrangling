 <p> Flesh for the Beast begins as a Rose Red rip-off about a big house that has served, during its long and illustrious career, both as (a). a whore house and (b). a lunatic asylum. as one might suspect, given this limited information, "The Fischer House" is fiercely haunted--in that squidgy way that is bound to make your dry cleaner cringe. a team of paranormal investigators are brought in by the building's new owner, ostensibly in hopes of bringing "peace" to the establishment and making it livable once more. but this team's fate is sealed at the opening scene, wherein we learn that the team leader is a big, cautious, sane, intelligent...black man* with an overdependence on technology, a "bad feeling about this," and a fear of guns.so i said to myself, "Self, now there's a guy who's going to end up crucified to the ceiling in an arbitrary and nonsensical fashion that will never be accounted for."** i was rather disappointed in Lead Black Guy (whose name now eludes me), really, because he's set up to be the hero--and even if he wasn't going to be the "hero" per se, i was at least hoping to see him do something more interesting than oh, say, die like a choad somewhere off camera.at any rate, you've got all the other stereotypical "horror" characters present too: Creepy Homeowner with a Cane and a Facial Scar, Uptight Blonde Psychic Who Will Probably Morph Into Someone Hot and Horny The Moment She Lets Her Hair Down and Quits Fainting, Skinny Little Weenie Guy with a Camera and a Suicidal Penchant for Kleptomania, and let us not forget Dork in a Knit Cap Who Wishes Something Interesting Would Happen. but i would argue that what this movie really needed in order to shake up the plot was a good homo. that's right--this flick needed a stouthearted gay man, because as this movie dramatically underscores, straight men are MORONS who cannot be trusted to think their way out of a wet sandwich wrapper when presented with a naked woman.allow me to explain. as it turns out, this spooky old building is still home to a few of the original working girls-now-turned-succubi. these flesh-hungry ex-whores spend their respective afterlives first seducing and second chomping their way through the digestive tracts of any and all male visitors to the Fischer House. what this means is that this movie is chock full of badly choreographed, comical sex scenes followed by disembowelment--and let me add that the disembowelment and subsequent gruesome death takes FAR longer than the nookie. not one of the doomed boys depicted could hang on for more than 8 seconds, making me suspect that the casting call for this movie was held at a rodeo. cripes, guys. i could keep a one-armed handstand longer than that--and i've got a bum elbow.in short, Flesh for the Beast was two hours of brief and sloppy boinking followed by a soft-tissue buffet--thanks to the inability of any given male to think beyond a neatly-waxed landing strip. </p>

 <p> If you want a slickly paced horror movie that makes you think and/or has you on the edge of your seat, pass this one over. If you want a horror movie that successfully mixes horror & humor, pass this one over as well. Now if you are looking for something that's full of schlocky goodness, this is the film for you.Flesh for the Beast's storyline isn't anything remotely new. It features a group of paranormal investigators who are hired by the owner of a mysterious & abandoned house to check it out. What follows is literally an orgy of sex & blood. The sex comes first, followed by the liberal shedding of blood by the hapless victim. Throughout it all you'll be rolling your eyes at how stupid the victims are even by horror movie standards & laughing at the sheer amount of nude shots thrown into the film. (Seriously, there's tons of them.)Is this film good? No. Does it fulfill it's basic requirement (to entertain) to the viewer? Yep, as long as this is the type of film you like to watch. Some will absolutely despise this film & throw it immediately into the wastebasket. Others will see this for the schlocky gem that it is & will immediately turn it into an impromptu MST3K session. For what it is, it's not that bad. It never takes itself seriously or tries to pretend that it is anything other than a cheesy horror movie, which works in it's benefit.If you enjoyed this film & want to know more about the film's succubi or if you merely want to read something in the same vein, I recommend tracking down the comic/manga book that follows the movie. It doesn't include the movie plot & instead has several new stories about the girls from the film. </p>

 <p> This movie proves that gore alone does not satisfy, especially when the gore is as bland and unsatisfying as that found in this first release from the guys at Media Blasters and Shriek Show.  The box this film comes in isn't bad, though; it actually makes the movie sound promising to a gore-hound such as me.  The selection of extra features included on the DVD also led me to believe that the movie was one I could sink my teeth into, quenching a little of my perpetual thirst for horror in the process.  Unfortunately, things go downhill quickly as soon as you open the box.  Director Terry West seems proud of this movie, and that makes me feel a pang of guilt when I declare Flesh For the Beast one of the most boring, bland, uninteresting horror films I've ever seen.All of the action in this low-budget disappointment takes place inside a haunted mansion.  The back-story to the plot, as if it really even matters, revolves around the man who built the house originally (it was a house of ill repute, by the way) and his acquisition of a certain amulet resembling a frog who has just been flatted by a steam roller.  Sergio Jones plays John Stoker, a man who bought the house five years ago and has been trying to rid it of its ghostly manifestations.  Our would-be heroes (or nitwits, as the case would be) are the latest team to try and bring peace to the house; unfortunately, most of them end up trying to "get a piece" (if you know what I mean) and forget all about trying to restore peace.  Yes, the house is haunted, and yes, our main characters each run across something not human; strangely enough, these so-called parapsychology "professionals" never even entertain the notion that the naked women they find in this "empty" house are anything more than real women desperate to make mad, passionate love to them.  There is a lot of gore, none of which is impressive in the least, and basically you just sit there counting the minutes hoping every single character in the movie dies a horrible death.  Lo and behold, there is a plot twist toward the end - I have to give the writers credit on that point; it's actually quite a trick to pull off a plot twist in a movie that has almost no plot to begin with.I know this movie did not have a large budget, but the special effects are just not very good in the eyes of this horror lover; the blood works, but blood is easy; the disemboweled guts are acceptable; the whole cannibalism thing offers a little satisfaction; but the makeup and masks worn by the "ghosts" did not impress me at all; the best looked like they had been bought at the nearest retail outlet store.  I actually suffered through the 30-minute-long featurette included on the DVD, as well, and the guys actually went into great detail on the whole special effects work; seeing how it was done made it even less impressive after the fact.  I think the biggest weakness this film has, though, is the acting.  If each actor had carried copies of the script around with him and read each line directly from the page, I think it would have been an improvement over the wooden, disaffected performances turned in by virtually everyone (except Ruby LaRocca, who actually does a pretty good job playing the silly character she portrays).  Scares? Frights?  Forget about it; there is nothing remotely frightening in or about this movie.  On a final note, I have to say that even the DVD is exceptionally annoying.  The first screen to come up after the legal notices featured four unlabelled medallions; the first one gave me a quick clip of a woman screaming at me, the second one ended up making me watch all the legal junk again, and the third eventually took me to the actual movie menu.  I don't know what the fourth selection might do, and I have no desire to find out.  My copy of DVD will almost surely remain inside the darkness of its case from now until eternity. </p>

 <p> Why do people automatically call crapfests like this "only for true horror fans" and such drivel.  I've been a horror fan for years and years and know when a low budget movie is good and when one is crap.  This...is CRAP!  All us REAL horror fans rue the day they made digital camcorders and neato graphic art programs so easy to use and affordable, because now we have too many self proclaimed film makers crapping up the video stores.  My children make better stories up with their homemade sock puppets.  Stop luring us in with cool cover art, nifty taglines, then torturing us with stinko productions!!!! </p>

 <p> This is it, folks.  The one you wait for.  The PIECES for a new milennium. The not-just-bad-it's horrible-the-it's-beyond-horribly-laughably-bad-so-much-that-it's-wonderful FLESH FOR THE BEAST.Plot?  Why bother?  A team of parapsychologists (most of whom resemble real actors - and who use such tools as radios, videocameras and what appears to be a Black-and-Decker electronic stud finder - "we've got paranormal activity every 16 inches!") investigates a mansion haunted by the spirits surrounding an evil con man/pimp/drug pusher - and pagan ritualist! - from the turn of the century.  And one-by-one, our team is, you guessed it, flesh for the beast.  To be exact, one by one, each horny teammate enters a room, finds a beautiful woman, makes love to her and then finds her turning into a monster and devouring him, usually from the intestines upward. This happens EVERY time to EVERY member of the team.  Somehow, evenutally the fellow responsible for the carnage is revealed vis-a-vis a flashback with the WORST throat-slitting effect ever, but by this point, your eyes have glazed over as a result of an endless assault of bare breasts, crotch shots and evisceral munching.Along the way, we're treated to wonderfully wooden and melodramatic dialogue, quotable snippets such as "makin' my bladder gladder...," and the use of the word "succubus" in the plural "succubi" TWICE.  That's right, TWICE. All of this plays along to the sounds of one of the worst horror scores of all times, provided by Buckethead. I was surprised at how poor the score was considering that wearing a KFC bucket on your head while you play the guitar usually makes it sound so much better. Maybe you should wear the bucket on your head while you listen to the score.You will hate this movie.  You will want your money back.  And you will immediately want to show this to all of your horror-fan friends.  Some things are so bad they must be shared again and again.  Luckily for you and me, this is one of them. </p>

 <p> I will be completely honest with everyone out there about this film. Caroline Munroe, ex-Hammer Films (Dracula A.D. 1972 andCaptain Kronos Vampire Hunter) babe is in this godawfull messso I just had to buy it. Caroline has a really small part in this film as a psychic fortune teller but she is still beautiful. Nice to see her again. No, this film is not all thatgreat I admit, but it is a heck of a lot better than House of the Dead. Tons of nudity and blood abound in this film though.I predict that someday this film will achieve some sort of smallcult status among some gorehounds out there. Look what time didfor Plan Nine From Outer Space. </p>

 <p> Well, what a pleasant surprise this one was.  After reading all the negative reviews of this film I wasn&#65533;t expecting much.  Well, I felt Flesh for the Beast was much better than other reviewers gave it credit for.  This movie is a cheap mixture of horror and erotica that undoubtebly would appall many but I liked it.  Then again I&#65533;m a person who has been known to scour my video store&#65533;s bins in search of seduction cinema titles to see what Misty Mundae and friends are up to next so maybe that&#65533;s just me.6 young individuals (5 males, 1 female) are invited to the mansion of John Stoker. The mansion was first built many years ago by Albert Fisher, who used to peddle drugs and prostitutes on the carney circuit.  Fisher built the mansion to serve as a brothel, for all intents and purposes.  Rumors of dark pagean rituals forced him to close doors.  A rumoured occultist, Fisher soon dissapeared, never to be found again.  But the house and its rumoured paranormal activity remain. Stoker informs them that his mansion is haunted and enlists their services to exorcise and clean it of all paranormal activity.As noted softcore smut director director Terry West explains in the extras his goal with this movie was to recreate the spirit of euro-sleeze horror of the 70&#65533;s.  Although filmed in America, all of the action takes place inside a mansion which enables West to achieve his goal.  The mansion looks great and is absolutely creepy; a labyrinth of tunnels, foyers, red curtains and gothic furniture. The film is liberally sprayed with huge doses of gore and nudity. The recurring premise is that whenever one of the male members of the crew searches a room for paranormal activity, there lies awaiting a beautiful women who never hesitates to take off her clothes and engage in intercourse (and following that, decapitation). As a matter of fact the nudity and sex scenes are the best realized of the whole film which is not a surprise given the director&#65533;s past film credits.I do understand why many people dislike this film.  The look is very cheap, akin to a BBC t.v. production.  The acting of course is horrendous, especially from the mansion&#65533;s host who you think would have been hired to do a half decent job given the big role he has in the film.  But worst of all are sheer moments of stupidity such as peeing in a toilet bowl without lifting the seat up first, and people engaging in intercourse without pulling down their pants!  The sheer cheapness of this film bothered me for the first twenty minutes but once the filmmakers started piling on the nudity and the gore I found it effectively entertaining.  Although many aspects of the film are bad, it doesn&#65533;t fail to entertain or grab viewer attention.  So lap it all up fans of trash cinema, this ain&#65533;t high art but it&#65533;s definitely great sleaze! </p>

 <p> I want to like this film.  It has a nice cover and the location is wonderful, but something doesn't work with it.The story seems decent enough; a mansion which used to be a brothel owned by a wealthy man who wanted to delve as far as he could with power... even seeking an amulet which supposedly can control demons, or in this case succubus.  Nothing is really determined about his death, but many years later another wealthy man buys the property and hires some paranormal investigators to &#34;cleanse&#34; it..Maybe it was the way the bland dialogue had too be rushed in order to make room for the Buckethead music videos.  It just seemed like there was a tug 'o war going on between dialogue sequences and artsy fartsy music video sequences.  But neither parts made a whole and the movie seemed to just lack an overall feel to it.  It covered up a lack of action in the deaths by doing stupid camera tricks and having the naked chicks with rubber masks on shaking their heads to Buckethead music while the camera man shook the camera... or maybe he was just nervous.  There is no struggle, no fighting back really - yet at the same time the people in the film didn't appear to be very mesmerized by the succubus either.It seems to me that there was so much missed opportunity here.  The location was gorgeous and even in bonus features it shows parts that weren't renovated and they looked fabulous and i just had to ask, &#34;WHY!?!?!?  Why didn't they use that area to film?&#34;  If the writing were better, we could have maybe cared about the story more and maybe characters would be likable.  I also thought many scenes drug out too long like the dude wanting to steal jewelry and we get like 10 minutes of zombies just standing at the door watching him... this whole scene could have been 2 minutes long and been more effective.  Another scene of the succubi gathering around a pentagram on the floor with bodies to eat seemed like a dull music video and took way too long and moved too slow.  I don't think the music really complimented the film and in some parts seemed annoying.I did want to like this film, it had so much going for it but just failed to deliver.  So many films are done with so little money and having almost nothing for locations, but have a good flow - this seemed to have some money and an excellent location with a good effects team and failed to deliver.  Hell, even the movie cover art looks good.In the end, you just need to see it.  I would say it gets 2.5 stars, but i cannot say i like it.  I think if they tightened the script, got some stylized lighting and worked on atmosphere and camera work rather than shaking the camera/blurring it/washing it out/distressing it, that this title could have been something, as it is it just exists and fails to draw you in. </p>

 <p> This is crap. They had a great mansion to shoot in (the film's only asset), but what happens inside is very stupid. There's no tension, no scares, just a lot of blood, guts (not that well done I might add) and a lot of sex scenes where men copulate with their pants on. The acting's sucky, the direction non-existent. There's little else to say about it. Stay away from it if you don't want your intelligence insulted. </p>

 <p> Look, we've got a lot(I mean A LOT) of nudity and sex, we've got some gore, we've got some cheesy freak-out effects, we've got the usual scares in a dark house repertoire, and we've got Buckethead doing the soundtrack.How can you NOT love that? I mean, BUCKETHEAD. NUDITY. CLICHE. EXTRAVAGANZA. Buy this movie immediately.Oh, I forgot to mention that the horror behind the house even has a good ol' fashion down-south New Orleans back story to it!This is the sort of film that, if Hollywood put a lot of money into it, it would be boring and trite and unwatchable. But since there wasn't these awful dollars put into it they had to make do with trite, cliche, and ridiculous and it's GOLDEN.And hey, if you don't mind losing about four minutes of lesbian revellry(and if you don't mind that, well you're probably not going to like this movie) you can pick it up in its R-Rated form in the Wicked Women three pack along with a couple of movies that don't quite meet up to the beauty of this film, but they are pretty close! </p>

 <p> I suspect that this is one of those Love it Or Hate it films.I'm not a Gore-hound, in fact some great Horror has had very little gore.This Film starts out with a Brilliant Story line, and just trashes it. If the Script was redone and had the supernatural line done properly ( and Photographed better), then the film would work, in my view.However, I like Attack of Killer Tomatoes, so you never can tell about taste.Actually, This is one film since I viewed John Cassavetes in INCUBUS, which I would say to anyone who asked... &quot;Don't Bother&quot;... there are far better and far scarier films around, and ones that have better sound too. </p>

 <p> Warning!  This is a cheesy horror film, shot on low budget.  I don't think they spent 5K on make up and effects, and yet still I (as a aficionado of cheesy horror flicks) actually found myself enjoying it.A team of parapsychologist experts are hired by a man who recently purchased an old mansion once known to be a notorious brothel.  He fails to tell them he is looking specifically for a medallion that will give him power over the succubi that still inhabit the mansion.One by one, as usual, the males of the team are picked off by the saucy succubi as they materialize with full knowledge of the men's fantasies.  Can it really be true that men become this stupid by the sight of a mere breast?  According to this movie, yes!A higher budget would have made this much better, but if you are ready to settle in for something cheesy you will more than likely enjoy this movie.Silly women, silly men, hungry succubi, a power hungry bad man, nudity and sex....well, there you have the makings for a horror film...it just needs more blood. Enjoy! </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> With some elements reminiscent of classic 70's type horror, Flesh For The Beast (2003) is a haunted house tale with an erotic twist.  The story is rather basic, but isn't executed very well.  The dialog is often ridiculous, and the acting passable at best.  Almost no attention is given to the lighting environment, which rarely is in the correct context or makes sense.  While some of the special effects work, the rubber masked demons are unconvincing.  The film is notable for the amount of nudity, as almost every major female character not only sheds their clothing, but engages in a sexual act.  Some spoilers follow, so read on for more specifics.John Stoker (Sergio Jones) is the owner of Fischer House, a large mansion where strange paranormal forces are very active.  Alfred Fischer the original owner, used the house as brothel, where certain occult practices also took place.  Stoker calls in a team specializing in investigating paranormal phenomena.  The group is led by Ted Sturgeon (Clark Beasley Jr.), who is sensitive to electric energy, and has a fear of firearms.  The rest of the team includes investigators Ketchum (Jim Coop) and Monks (David Runco), psychic Erin Cooper (Jane Scarlett), and videographers Clegg (Aaron Clayton) and Shelly (Michael Sinterniklaas).As night falls, the team separates and begins their investigations.  Each member is in radio contact with Monks, who is monitoring the team.  The presence of interior lighting seems to vary, and some use flashlights to make their way around, while some spaces are well lighted.  Strurgeon's fears prove to be well founded, as he becomes the first victim of the supernatural powers in the house.Ketchum is taking a leak, when the room suddenly gets bright, and he unexpectedly discovers a young woman with him in the bathroom.  These strange events apparently are not a cause for alarm, as after the woman drops her clothing, Ketchum rapes her on the bathroom sink.  After the act, the woman turns into a demon, and rips her attacker to shreds.  This establishes a pattern that repeats itself several more times, as various members of the team encounter flirtatious women who get naked, and then attack.  A climax occurs when three naked blood soaked women, circle a dead body lying on the floor, in a pool of blood.  They pull his flesh apart and rub his guts and blood on their bodies.  While not at all convincing, it's not the kind of thing you see every day.While the men are falling victim to the demons, Erin who is with Stoker, is receiving psychic impressions from the house.  Stoker is looking for a beetle shaped medallion, which he hopes will give him control over the demons.  Things look promising for Stoker, after Erin helps him locate it.  Although Stoker has possession of the medallion, things don't quite go as he planned.Featured together in cameo roles are Caroline Munro as a gypsy, and Aldo Sambrell as Alfred Fischer, the evil occultist.  The theme of being covered in blood is reinforced in an impressive sequence, where Stoker is showered in blood from a body nailed to the ceiling.Attractive female demons, willing to get naked with very little encouragement, will almost always be of interest.  Nothing against nudity and sex, but when the same routine is repeated again and again, suspense is replaced by soft core porn.  The naked demons played by Ruby Larocca, Caroline Hoermann, and Barbara Joyce, may be what you will most remember about the film.  Writer/director Terry West apparently believes that he has produced a horror masterpiece, but rather than being very scary, the film is more of an erotic thriller, and unintentional horror-comedy. </p>
