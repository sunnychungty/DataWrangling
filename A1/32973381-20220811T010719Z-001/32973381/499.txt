<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I found while reading &#34;Healing Your Inner Child&#34; I was seeing back through my past and how they have shaped me to be who i am now. All the wrongs of my childhood. I loved how Miranda explained how these events shaped us and who we are right now. It gave me inspiration to be authentic to myself! </p>

 <p> Healing Your Inner Child: Unlocking the Child Within Through Self-Analysis is very interesting read. I found the book fascinating. I ideas and suggestion in here are something I have never heard before and I found them very intriguing. I would definitely recommend you read this book! </p>

 <p> While this book is written for adults with a view to healing your own inner child it would serve any parent well to read this entirely. It has a good deal of common sense built in to helping us as adults but I kept thinking how young parents should be as mindful of the issues brought up in this book. I'd recommend this to older adults and young couples with young children. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> We are our most honest and creative selves as children, yet it is as children that we are  most fragile and vulnerable.  In her book, Healing Your Inner Child, Miranda Johnson talks about how as we grow older, our maturing selves, influenced by adults, friends, and teaches begin to silence our now inner child.  Hurt and forgotten, the natural spontaneity of the child is now cowed. Miranda goes into great detail about the many ways that we as children are emotionally eclipsed by people of authority. Fortunately we can awaken our inner child and discover our true authentic selves.  It is a journey and not one taken over night, but one worth embarking on.  You will learn to once again play, be creative, enjoy and live life more fully. </p>

 <p> Understanding how your &#8216;disappointed or disillusioned&#8217; inner child can impact the rest of your life is quite an amazing concept, and this book outlines it in a clear and yet inspirational way.  Not only does it identify how we can hurt and lock up that &#8216;inner child', but it gives some fantastic strategies for how we can get it back!  I found this book very inspirational as I read through it.  It caused me to sit back, consider, and re-prioritise both where I am at and where I want to go.  I also really appreciated the breakdown of all the contributors to our losing that inner child &#8211; family issues, peer pressure, even teachers and new life structures.  All of this leads to a very helpful section on how to heal.  An inspiring and informative book that applies to anyone who has ever pondered where their inner child went, and how great it would be to heal and unlock it! </p>

 <p> It's good to read something that can help me ease my worries such as this. I have been trying to set free my inner child and as I am capable now of taking care of myself I think it's time for me to follow my own path. I have a controlling parents who wanted me to live my life as they have planned. I think defying your parents is not wrong at all when you know you are following your heart and you are determined that you can be someone better in the path you chose. The most important thing one should always remember is to make sure the path they chose for themselves is also the path to their happiness and fulfillment in life. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I am a product of a broken family. When I was younger, my dad cheated that caused my parents divorce. The truth is, moving on is too difficult for me until I reached 24. All my younger years were filled with suffering that it is difficult for me to get past the negative events in my life. It was a painful emotional trauma and no one really taught me how to properly deal with it. The author understands the readers very well. It targets the core issues of a broken inner child and gave healing methods to try. This book serves loads of information that I will definitely need when raising my own child. With this book, I have come to know myself more and understand children. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Very interesting concept </p>

 <p> This is very interesting, it is like trying to look at things in a similar way we used to look at the when we were children. The book talks about bringing out your inner child and help it relearn things.The book will help you overcome childhood issues you had that were repressed and now even if you are not completely aware they are there, they still affect you in your adult life so you need to solve them so you can have a better life. Even things from childhood that were the result of poor or bad guidance from teachers, teachers being practically everyone you learned form in your childhood. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Am still learning from this book! </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> A good book to remind us that we must forgive ourselves and face our fears/guilt. Easier said than done, of course. But I often go back to this, open a page, and start reading. And I always learn something new about myself. Author provides techniques for healing your inner child, as well as using communication and compassion to improve relationships, with both ourselves and others. I would recommend this book to anyone with an open mind. </p>
