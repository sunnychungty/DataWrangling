<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> This is not a genuine product. Do not buy. </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This product claims to be a Genuine Dell Product for a Dell Studio laptop. I just found out from a Dell tech that it burned out the motherboard for my laptop because the adapter is actually putting out twice as many amps as the original that came with the laptop. Do not buy! I will be asing for a return or a refund and alerting Amazon directly about this product. </p>

 <p> This replaced my old power adapter exactly and has worked for several months now without fanfare. It is authentic Dell, not a knock off. The only reason I did not give it a 5 start rating is that I can't honestly say, &#34;I love it&#34;, for something so basic. I would truly miss it if was lost, though. </p>

<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Known defective product and fire hazard! </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> *************************************************************WARNING: Running any laptop power supply continuously at its maximum wattage rating can cause serious overheating.  This family of Dell OEM power supplies is rated at a MAXIMUM of 90 watts.  The laptops the power supply is made for require a MINIMUM of 90 watts.  This creates a situation where the power supply will overheat.  Placement on any surface can result in fire, in the case of this power supply very quickly.It is advised that users disconnect the power supply from both the laptop and the AC power outlet whenever the user is not present, even if just for a few moments.  Testing of both the original power supply that came with the laptop when purchased new in May 2009, as well as the replacement OEM power supply purchased last summer, showed the "block" portion can burn paper and melt plastic within 30 minutes of operation.  Rigging up a way to suspend the "block" portion of the power supply, and blowing a fairly powerful fan on it, will at least keep the temperature low enough to not melt or burn anything.  But, I still recommend unplugging it when you leave the room for any length of time, just to be safe.  Also, don't let young children, the elderly, or anyone who has skin that burns easily anywhere near the power supply, they will get burned by it.*************************************************************Dell is very much aware of the problem, especially after years of complaints from hundreds of thousands of customers.  It would appear Dell's solution to the problem is to simply ignore it, despite the obvious problems and dangers.  If I didn't know better, I would swear Dell is trying to put themselves out of business.Other than the obvious fire hazard, this improper power supply causes other problems as well.  The system BIOS warns immediately that the power supply is not the correct one, and that it is underpowered.  You have to press F1 to continue to boot the laptop, or you can choose one of the other options to enter setup or change the way the computer boots.  Going into the BIOS setup will allow you to turn off the warning message regarding the power supply, but that doesn't eliminate the problem.  Windows operatings systems (XP, Vista, and 7) will also detect the problem with the power supply.  When it does, it will cut all computer functionality by 50%, and refuse to charge the battery.  I run a dual-boot with Linux, and Linux will not cut the system capabilities like Windows does.  But, as the above warning indicates, it is dangerous and a fire hazard to run any laptop power supply at its maximum wattage rating.You will find this problem with ANY 90 watt power supply, at least for the Studio series of laptops, all of which require a minimum of 90 watts to operate correctly.  I solved the problem by purchasing the 130 watt power supply meant for the Studio XPS series.  Unfortunately, Dell will not sell these to consumers unless they have a valid service tag number that indicates that is the type of power supply your laptop requires, so I had to go through a third party to obtain it.  The Studio 1737 runs just fine with it, though I did have to replace the OEM battery, due to the damage done to it by the OEM power supply.If you choose to get a non-OEM 130 watt power supply through a third party, make sure the voltage is the same, that the amperage is at least what this power supply calls for, and that the connector is the same inside and outside diameter, with the center pin.  Just hold off on replacing your battery until after you replace the underpowered power supply (it may still work, if you caught the problem early enough).Sorry for the rant on this one, but Dell has had years to fix this problem, and continues to simply pretend the problem doesn't exist.  I called them a few weeks ago about this ongoing problem (I have several friends who bought Dell based upon my recommendation a few years ago, and they're having the same power supply issues everyone else is having), and the Dell representative acted like it was the first time she ever heard of the problem.  Since they won't fix it, all I can do is warn others that the product is dangerous.The only ones who seem to have no issues with this power supply apparently are employees of Dell, and those who got stuck with a bunch of these they can't seem to sell at any price. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> This is my fourth one (Updated: Now onto No. 5) </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This is my fourth time buying this same OEM adapter. Needless to say, having a repeat customer for a product such as an AC adapter is usually not a good sign. It does what it is supposed to do, but not for long. I once bought a non-OEM adapter that is compatible with this PA-3E, and that one lasted less than a month. Since each of these OEM ones that I have bought on the average has lasted nine (9) months, I perhaps ought to be grateful, but I am not. It seems that I will have to keep on buying this adapter for so long as I own my Dell Studio 1555. Thanks to the crappy adapter, I am well tempted to ditch the Dell for another make for a new laptop.UPDATED: 3/23/2013This adapter died a week ago, having lasted all of two months. Another PA-3E adapter works fine on my PC, so it is definitely this product that is the problem. The rating is therefore downgraded to a single star. </p>

 <p> This power cord does not charge the battery. Even though it has the same part number, and appears to be from Dell, it does not perform as it should. It merely keeps the laptop on, but does not charge. </p>

 <p> This charger works great, direct replacement for any dell that will take a 90 watt.  It's about half the thickness and weight of the original charger.  The indicator lights are nice, a little bright at night though.  Worth every penny. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I bought this earlier this year and although mine is still working, there are some strange anomolies. One time I noticed my pillow was extra warm and found it going critical underneath. The plastic information sticker warmed to a temperature that cuase it to severely warp and the unit was too hot to handle with bare hands. The computer (xps l501x) doesn't seem to recognize the adapter and complains about it each boot. It still seems to work though. I am not surprised to hear of other reports that units are melting and starting fires. Be careful with this unit. Although it does seem to good to be true since it's 1/3 the price dell sells for, remember that technology companies are all using the same Asian factories to produce and official products have been reported melting down too. I remember the original unit I had getting pretty hot too and it failed after a year, so I wouldn't go running to Dell for $65 just yet. Just keep an eye on where this thing is in case it melts, so you don't have to put out any fires. </p>

 <p> Hoping it will work. </p>

 <p> For reference: I'm working with a Dell Inspiron 1545 and I bought this 90-watt charger from the seller "xiaming lv".Received this replacement for the 2-year-old 65-watt charger I got with the original purchase of my laptop.  Ordered this one 5 days ago and it came in today.  Computer recognized it immediately, the blue light lit up, and it's charging the computer.  We'll see if the $25 price tag (vs. $65 on Dell.com) was worth it.  Crossing my fingers!And it should be noted that the tip is CYLINDRICAL.  My computer has an octagonal port, and I thought this might be the wrong part when it came in, but it plugs in and works.  Maybe it's to make the charger more universal?UPDATE: The brick heats up very quickly (&lt;10 minutes), but doesn't seem hot enough to burn.  I have it set up on my shelf on top of an old oven mitt.  Hoping the heat won't damage anything internally, though the mitt really ruins the atmosphere of my desk.UPDATE: It would be wise to temper the life of this product by not leaving it plugged in/powered up all the time.  I unplug this before I go to bed because of the brick heating up.  No smoke/fire/sparks or anything, but touch it the wrong way after a couple hours and ouch!  I've taken to setting this up on its side, balancing it, so that there's more surface area to help it "keep cool." </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I am not sure if the vendor is to blame or the manufacturer, but the product lasted two days and quit.  It is obvious the quality control was not working somewhere in the supply chain.  Fortunately Amazon has an excellent return policy and I was not out of money, just out of luck as I live in Africa and had to send the piece back with the person who brought it, but now my wife and I are back to working with only one power supply between two Dell computers until we can find another power supply that is workable. </p>

 <p> I ended up returning this item. Although it was a "Genuine Dell" charger & listed as a replacement for the Inspiron laptop we have, it did not charge the battery. It provided power to the laptop, but was not properly recognized for whatever reason, so I returned it. It also seemed like it got very hot. I know it was the adapter & not the laptop that was the problem because the adapter did the same thing with my Vostro (which is also listed as compatible) & the adapter for my Vostro worked fine on the Inspiron. I purchased another adapter from another vendor & the other adapter works fine. </p>

 <p> I bought this to replace the failed cord on my Inspiron 1440. This is my second attempt at a replacement through Amazon. This one is an actual Dell replacement and works fantastically. The shape is a little different than my original, but charges better than the original ever did. I have never seen my battery charget to 100%. Very impressed and much cheaper than Dell's replacement. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> The original Dell AC Adapter for my Inspiron Laptop died after a few years.  This adapter is identical to the one it replaced.  I have had absolutely no issues with it at all.  Yes it gets hot, just as the original did and mostly all slim type adapters but it does the job.  I've had no issues with "sparks" and "fire" as some have posted and I am skeptical of those reviews.  This adapter is UL Listed and contains the Dell brand name.  It certainly is not a fake as others have claimed.  Great purchase considering the very same one on the OEM site was nearly $60 more expensive. </p>

 <p> Great OEM, Been using for more than a year, and it's still going strong. I recommend sticking with OEM laptop power supplies if at all possible. This was an unbeatable price for this item. </p>
