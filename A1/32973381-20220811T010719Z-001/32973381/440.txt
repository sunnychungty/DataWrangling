 <p> This is one easy read and very enjoyable.  It is the story of a girl who's boyfriend dies in a tragic accident and she has a hard time letting go.  She meets Eric who had recently had heart surgery and she believes he has her dead boyfriend's heart and they become really "close" friends. I really enjoyed the pace of the story and although very predictable it was still worth reading. </p>

 <p> This was a different kind of romance. Its about losing it all, picking up the pieces, and being able to love again. </p>

 <p> It seems like an idea we have heard before. Maybe in a 1960s movie. But the author puts a new spin on the theme. Ren seems very real to me. She is someone I would like to meet (as my daughter's friend, I am not a lech.)The attraction seemed real. The conversations all seem very real. Kudos to the auth </p>

 <p> I knew I had to read this book by June Gray (Wilette Youkey) after I fell in love with her DISARM series and boy I was not disappointed! This book reminded me of one of my favorite movies (Return to Me), but this story did have a different spin for sure. There is something about the way June writes that makes me connect to her characters. Terrific read, I loved it. </p>

 <p> I really enjoyed this book. It had a mixture of emotions. As one of the previous reviews stated this book is bittersweet. This book will make you smile and tear up in the same chapter. Other times I wanted to reach in the book and slap them both, for being so pig headed!Read this book. You'll enjoy it. </p>

 <p> I rated this book four stars.  This is is the first book I have read by this author.It was a well written story that easily held my interest. I would like to read other books by this author.I guess the only criticism I would offer was the number of misunderstandings between hero and heroine was annoying. But the author worked it out in the ending. </p>

 <p> It is a difficult task to clean out a loved ones home after a death, and learning athings about them you didn't already know.Whoever thought a new love would evolve on a plane flite at this time.  A cross country romance evolves and happiness comes in the end. </p>

 <p> This was a very interesting story.  I like the meet, friendship, develops into more story line.  I enjoyed Ren and Eric's relationships and the evolution they went through. I do wish the epilogue went a little further down the line in their relationship besides a few weeks but all in all I liked the book. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Cute friendship to more book! </p>

 <p> I started reading this book around 1am and was done by 3:30am, despite the fact that I had to get up very early today. I couldn't put it down! It's a sweet story with two likable characters with chemistry. I found myself smiling and laughing out loud many times. Oh, and I cried a few times too. That's because the story is also believable. Ren and Eric have to work for it and it felt like 'real couple' problems. I also enjoyed that their romance was also built on friendship. With the right cast, this could definitely be a charming romantic comedy. If you're looking for a quick (don't want to stop reading), funny, feel good read, this is it. </p>

 <p> I am an avid reader of romance novels. This is one of the best books i've read in quite some time. The characters have depth the story is compelling and emotionally lovely. I can't wait to read other books by this author. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> I honestly did like the story and it did make me cry but the part in the middle where Eric took on a serious girlfriend did not sit well with me. The 2 main characters obviously had a connection and he said she was his soulmate so why would he get involved in such a serious romance with another woman? It didn't work for me and spoilt things a bit. It wasn't well handled or ended either for my liking. </p>

 <p> A nice story but... </p>
