 <p> DJ may have completely outdone himself with his latest novel, which centers around one man and the two women in his life.  For David, life is going well; he is a successful author and he is engaged to be married to the beautiful, adoring Janelle.  David is happy....or so he thinks.  Fate is determined to throw a monkey wrench into his future plans, in the form of first love Jocelyn, who he runs into while in Philadelphia for a booksigning.  Sparks fly, the feelings are still there, and both find themselves wondering...what if?  The two exchange email addresses, and part ways.But David cannot get Jocelyn out of his mind...and sends her an email confessing his feelings.  Unhappily married, Jocelyn finds herself yearning for David also...and confesses the same.  Soon, the two arrange to meet in Baltimore over a weekend, to spend some time together, and talk.....and thus a love affair is born.  But what of Janelle, and the unconditional love that David has with her?  And what about Eric, seemingly the perfect husband?  It doesn't take long for deception and betrayal to catch up to the secret lovers....and the drama that unfolds is nothing short of gut-wrenching.  When it is all said and done, readers are left to ponder...can we ever recapture what was lost?  Certainly, David and Jocelyn face some difficult choices in this tale.....DJ has recaptured the magic that I found while reading The Womanizers in this novel...it is filled with drama, heartache, and lessons to be learned.  Very enjoyable read.DYB </p>

 <p> I've waited so long to get this book because I thought it would be something interesting, but it damn sure wasn't what I was expecting. There was nothing in this book that made you want to fall head first into it. Although it was well written and a good plot and idea but lacked a lot of substance. I thinkMr. Joseph could have taken his time and really tried to make the characters way more intriguing. Maybe I was expecting too much though. I don't mean to say it but it was good just not good enough. </p>

 <p> I didn't know this book would be so good. It was so fast-paced that I finished it off in a one night. I shook my head as David and Jocelyn relentlessly went against everything I personally believe in when it comes to relationships and fidelity. Eric and Janelle truly didn't deserve the deceit and treacherous heartbreak that was thrown their ways. I cried tears over Isaiah. Marc, Kim, and Marisol were great supporting characters. The ending actually surprised me. I think Eric did the right thing in the end. Jocelyn was indeed tainted and no longer good enough for him.  As for David and Janelle...I think they really did belong together because in spite of David's unfaithfulness, he truly loved Janelle and she loved him back. Good job by this author.This book doesn't need a follow-up, but I would be happy to read one anyway. </p>

 <p> This is the first book I've read by Dwayne Joseph and I must say that I wasn't disappointed. The book had a slow start but finished up great. This is a good read. I don't think Janelle should've given David a second chance but hey love conquers all....I guess. </p>

 <p> What first caught my attention about this book was the title because in my head I was singing the Aaliyah song and after I realized that the book was by a friend of mine I knew I had to get it because I knew it was going to be a hot joint.  Well needless to say I finished the book in a cool five hours and was highly impressed.  I have read much work in the literary world as well as read quite a few by Mr. Joseph himself and I got to say every time I read something new Dwayne turns the heat up. </p>

 <p> This book was a page turner.  It was one thing after another.  I couldn't believe how stupid David and Jocelyn were but in the end everything came around and was either good or bad on both of them.  I really liked the ending...I was very surprized.  But that book David published must have said alot to make Janelle change her mind.  But otherwise this was a very good read and I'm going to keep track of the next book to come. </p>

 <p> This was my first book by this author and I will read others.  The book was slow at first almost boring; however, about page 80 it started to pick up and I really did enjoy the story.  It was well written and it flowed very well.  The characters were very real and boy was there relationship drama.  I felt sorry for David at times, but I'm sure he learned a lot!  Again, great story and I'm looking forward to reading more books by this author. </p>

 <p> I'm glad he got his life towards the end and realized the other chick wasn't even who he thought she was but I think Janelle deserved a little more than an apology. I would've liked to see Dwayne build on their storyline and show how they made it past all the hurt and the pain. I'm glad he kept it real but I could've done without the couple's friends and their storylines. </p>
