 <p> Ok So It Isn't Perfect... </p>

 <p> Yes I am sure we can all agree that this is not what one would call the greatest of horror movies.  It was a direct to video production if I recall (I remember the VHS tape had a button that would make the eyes glow on the zombie chap on the front cover).  Still, I liked the story, the story had promise to it, better than some of the randomized zombie movies made at the time.  I think that the story works well as an almost Lovecraftian zombie story (not on par as the Re-Animator series but still heading up there).  There was a feeling of foreboding throughout the first thirty minutes that moved the story quite nicely.  When the horror really begins, I, in my humble opinion, feels that it goes quickly with much horror and suspence toward the--sadly, clich&eacute; ending.  Still I can forgive the ending.  Really if you are expecting George Romero, you wont find him here, but I highly believe this is a good movie to have... </p>

 <p> I agree with one of the reviews this is a dark creppy nightmarish film,ignore the negative reviews and watch it for yourself.the gore was great,and the plot fast and scary beleieve me i am a collector of ever horror movie you can imagine and i do not scare easily but this movie was eerie.I am not going to write a complete essay on this but people need to stop comparing this to dawn of of the dead or george romero this movie is a totally diffrent ball game. overall this horror movie rocks. P.S. People who like Up to date horror,and digital graphics horror will not like this film,but people who appreciate dr. Giggles,and evil-ed and creative horror will like this. That what i love of about old horror is art is about creativity,and experiment,unlike the stupid movies now. Enjoy................... </p>

 <p> This is the darkest, gloomiest zombie flick I have ever seen. From beginning to end, just totally creepy. It's like a beautiful nightmare. The main character in the movie, Jane Doe, is played by Cheryl Lawson, and I think she does an excellent job of overdramatic, but not bad, acting. Especially when she freaks out or is being hypnotized by the doctor. Not a whole lot of gore, but a lot of really cool looking zombies out for brains. Basically, a hopelessly zoned out woman is stalked by an undead doctor at a mental institution. Very creeped out music. I like this movie. The box for the movie has a zombie on the cover with little light bulbs for his eyes. When you press a button, the eyes start blinking! Over the top movie. </p>

 <p> A deranged doctor at a state mental institution carries out unethical, illegal, and 100% lethal brain experiments. He is stopped by a bullet through the head. Twenty years later, an earthquake resurrects the good doctor, along w/ his many dead patients! THE DEAD PIT is a fab slab of gory, 80s cheeeze w/ lots of mad science, gloomy atmosphere, and brains exiting craniums. The PIT of the title is revealed at the beginning, as the doctor's body-dumping site. The zombies are well-done, and their gooshy demise is pretty cool... </p>

 <p> This film is pretty trashy and tasteless, so don't watch it expecting to be scared. The gore is really over the top in the final reel, and the first part of the movie reminded me of the film Hellhole, in that it takes place in a mental institution and there's some nudity and women in prison action. Sleazy. Then the zombies show up and the real chaos ensues. Awesome! </p>

 <p> I passed on this movie so many times because of negative reviews. But I just had to break downand get it for my zombie collection...and I'm glad I did.The movie is about this Dr.Ramzi that kills some of his patients in the mental institution for a experiment his doing. He takesthe body's into a hidden basement and works on the brains to control them &#34;like Phantasm&#34; but fails many times and throws the bodies in the &#34;dead pit&#34;. But he get's killed from the head doctor &#34;Dr.Swan&#34; when he finds out what Dr. Ramzi is doing. He seals the door to the basement to forever lock him in. Years later a women get's sent to the institution because of amnesia. She starts to have a bad feeling about the place...then a earthquake happens and unseals the door to the basement, Dr.Ramzi get's out and the killing starts. The &#34;zombies&#34; from the deadpit awaken towards the end and it's cool.Overall the movie as decent acting but it's truly scary.  It might move a little slow but that's how every good horror film does.The story is interesting enough and the main villain is cool, I recommend it. </p>

 <p> Ok, so this is no 'Dawn of the Dead' but I found it a welcome installment into the Zombie genre.  I'm a fan that's endlessly searched for cool new zombie movies and I've seen the worst of the worst in my efforts.  'The Dead Pit' is not that bad.  It does have some slow parts in the middle, but the last 20-25 minutes is zombie hoard city!  If you're like me and have to see anything zombie, rent this!  With all the garbage out there nowdays, this film looks pretty good.  Also, there is an uncut version of this movie out there somewhere that is said to be much more gory.  I'm sure that version would be alot better, but if you can't find it, give this copy a try.  It's a good little zombie flick. </p>

 <p> Taking place mostly indoors in an asylum, this late 80s film is one my favorite zombie films.  The simplistic plot involves a deceased mad doctor being reanimated by an earthquake.  With his horde of zombies, he kills and conducts experiments on the inmates at the asylum.  Unlike other zombie films, the zombies simply tear open peoples heads and pull out and fondle there brains.  There's a little bit of topless nudity, and Cheryl Lawson ( who's the main actress) looks great.  There's plenty of gore and violence, although some of the violence is off screen.  One scene worth mentioning involves a gruesome scene where the doctor is piercing an exposed brain with needles.  The zombies look great, and the mad zombie doctor is particularly menacing.  The directing and acting are good, and the pace is pretty fast; although some people might think it's a little slow in parts.  It's also a very well scored film, and I personally think it has excellent replay value. However, It should be noted that I'm a big fan of 70s and 80s zombie films, so some people may not like it as much as me.The DVD quality is very good, but it isn't as good as some of Code Red's later releases.  The color, contrast, and sharpness look fine. </p>

 <p> This movie made our must-buy list for 80s horror because it's got a great feel to it. If you're into 80s horror, you likely know what I mean, but can't seem to find the right words for. I bought it on VHS so it could be experienced exactly as we experienced it as kids. This movie's a keeper. Perfect for those who enjoy this kind of movie, and you already know who you are.  :O) </p>

 <p> Actually filmed in a real State Hospital in CA this late 80's zombie movie is one of the best. This is a really fun movie to watch as it's creepy and suspenseful. I like Cheryl Lawson in the lead role and I wonder why she didn't have a career after this. So the plot is that a sadistic doctor was killed while conducting experiments on mental patients, fast forward 20 years and a unknown women enters the Hospital with amnesia and ends up opening the dead pit.The doctor comes back to life to continue his evil experiments and and Cheryl is in the middle of it all! Very underrated movie. </p>

 <p> This is a pretty good example of how a crappy movie can become a "hidden little gem" as you reviewers like to put it.  The music/sound has pretty much everything to do with why I was able to get all the way through this movie - although it doesn't hurt that it came out in the 80's (even know it was the LATE 80's).  All hail the moog keyboard!  The acting was actually very entertaining in its own right.  Not bad - if you're a skeptic, just rent it!  If you're a fan of the genre - you probably already own it! </p>

 <p> The Dead Pit 1989 (*VHS "R") - Directed by Brett LeonardAn evil doctor that experiments on his mentally ill patients is entombed in the basement of an abandoned wing. 20 years later, an amnesia patient known only as Jane Doe (Cheryl Lawson), arrives. An earthquake breaks the seal releasing the doctor to continue his dirty work. The dead patients also rise to wreck havoc.The biggest complaint I heard from other reviewers was about Lawson's acting ability, which I do not think is that bad considering this is her first feature. She is not Scream Queen material though and would be better suited for a Lifetime movie. (She won acting awards for this role and has since had a long career as a stunt woman). And why is she running around in her underwear? Not only would this be considered unethical treatment for patients, but since when are bikini panties standard issue? She would be wearing granny undies. One size fits all... This movie suspiciously looks a lot like Nightmare on Elm Street, which was released 5 years prior to this. Our Jane Doe looks identical to Elm Street's heroine Nancy Thompson. And the scenes where she is running in a dreamlike state evading the evil man in her dreams... But what really made me take notice was the scene where she is following her recently deceased friend only to be lead to Freddy, uhhh....I mean the evil doctor.This venture was a bit disappointing for director Leonard (Lawnmower Man, Feed) especially considering he co-wrote the script. There are a few script problems that should have been tweaked during script rewrites. Why do the doctors and nurses speak to patients like best friends? If there is limited funding for this mental institute, then why do they admit someone with amnesia and other minor illnesses? How likely is it that not one, but two patients are snooping around and solving mysteries? The biggest problem is that I guessed the surprise ending early on in the film.And while the film touches on controversial subjects like performing illegal lobotomies on patients, but never digs deep enough to leave a lasting impression on the viewer. There were a few scenes cut from the R rated version I watched such as an open brain surgery. Hopefully these scenes will be added in the upcoming DVD release.What stands out in the film are the top notch special effects provided by Ed Martinez. The zombies were the most exciting part of the movie although they come late at the 67 minute mark. You know the fun starts once the zombies emerge from the dead pit bald, rotting, and slimy. The patients later learn that a little bit of holy water goes a long way and we are treated to many melting faces.My favorite scene was toward the end when the "good" doctor (played by the late Jeremy Slate) walks down a hall hearing this disgusting gurgling, choking noise. When he enters the bathroom, it is covered with blood and the nurse walks towards him looking not so hot at the moment.Overall, I think they didn't try hard enough in the first part of the movie. With 2 writers on board, they should have been able to make a clever script with cool dialogue. They have a mental institution, a nun, amnesia, zombies, etc and they still struggled to make it interesting. Maybe they could have shown the orderlies and nurses being abusive towards the patients to make the first half of the film more dramatic and the zombies killing them in the second half bittersweet. Or why not add more religious themes since they had the nun patient blessing holy water? And if they insist on making Jane run around in panties, then why not sleaze it up to make it more fun? There were several different directions this film could have gone, but seemed to just tiptoe around the subjects instead of tackling them head on.Favorite Quote: None. The dialogue was lackluster. And shamefully, it wasn't even goofy enough to make me laugh.Extras: *This was the VHS version with no extras other than a few trailers at the beginning. (It won "The Best Video Box of the Year" by Entertainment magazine when it was first released). A special DVD release is in the process now with SFX artist Ed Martinez providing commentary and SFX extras. Commentary has already been recorded with director Brett Leonard, producer Gimel Everett, and the late actor Jeremy Slate. See the Ed Martinez Interview with HorrorYearbook for details.[...]Bottom Line: A must see for Leonard fans interested in his filmography. Has some noteworthy scenes, but fails to be controversial or very scary.Rating: 7/10Molly Celaschi [...] </p>

 <p> 'The Dead Pit' is one of those movies which makes you wish they had done more. The direction and cinematography are well done. Quite frankly there are several scenes in this movie that are very well done and look like they should be in a much better movie with a story and acting that are equal. Unfortunately it is the story and acting and a few poorly done effects that drag it down. This is the story of a doctor at a mental asylum, 20 years ago, who performed experiments on the brains of patients in an underground lab (where did you expect his lab to be) for the purpose of resurrecting the dead. Another doctor discovers his heresies and in the ensuing fight the lab ends up being sealed shut. Fast forward 20 years later where an attractive young woman is committed to the same mental asylum where her father was a doctor who disappeared 20 years ago. She then spends a good amount of time running around in her underwear and being tormented by a female warden (dang; I just made it sound interesing). In the mental asylum there are the usual assortment of patients that inhabit most asylums in horror movies. Although well directed, there is not much a director can do with a story that drags as this does through about 40 minutes of the middle of the movie as misdirection is used to an annoying degree. There is a certain level of humor that creeps in, as well some scenes obviously aimed at guys. The zombies in this movie look more like the colorized version of 'Night of the Living Dead', but they do like to read car repair manuals (there is a joke in that which refers to a specific humorous scene in the movie). The climax of this movie is in a category of seriously bad movie climaxes. If you like b-movies you may well enjoy this since this is a b-movie script, but with a very good film crew. If you are looking for a Romero or Fulci type of movie, it will not be found here.-Bob </p>

 <p> The only copy I had of this movie was the German Dragon dvd release from like 12 years ago.I rented this on vhs back in 1992 I believe and thought it wasn`t bad although I didn`t realize that it had been severely cut at the time.When I heard there was an un-cut version years ago I had to have it.Thanks to Code Red I got the only package of this movie I`ll ever need.Mine even came with a Brett Leonard autograph on the plastic front.The extras are good.Cheryl Lawson is such a cutie.Wish they could have found Stefan Foster for an interview.His character was cool.Especially the way he goes out in the end.I really enjoy movies with low budgets that deliver the goods.CGI and A-list celebs aren`t my bag. </p>
