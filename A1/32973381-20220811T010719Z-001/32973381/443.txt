 <p> This book has a unique idea and followed through with it very well. The characters are cute and my kids liked the wolf, even though he is supposed to be the villain. The pictures are colorful and hold the child's attention. My kids laughed out loud as we read this. The story is simple and yet has enough substance to make it worth reading. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a cute story for their 4-7 year old. We liked it! </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> The Wolf Who Couldn't Stop His Hiccups is a basic repetitive type story that has a young wolf (the wolf is drawn in a non scary sort awkward teenager character not your typical big bad wolf style), who time and time again tries to sneak into a chicken coop, barn or whatever type of enclosure various farm animals are sleeping in and quietly take one of them as his dinner while the rest sleep on and don't attack him. Of course his hiccups never allow his plans to come off with each time his prey coming up with an old wives tale type remedy for him to try in exchange for never coming back and eating any of them.  The wolf isn't the brightest wolf in the world, and that helps the story as if he just worked out to use the chicken's remedy a second time we wouldn't have much of a story and he wouldn't be hungry anymore.Illustrations are very high quality cartoon style, the cover image is a good indication of the pages inside. </p>
