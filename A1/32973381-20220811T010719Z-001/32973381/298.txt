 <p> Captain caveman is a fun show to watch. I would reccomend it to anyone who loves Hanna Barbera cartoons. Good stuff! </p>

 <p> Another very popular late '70s Saturday morning cartoon has just reached DVD through Warner Archive and, depending on your attachment to childhood memories, is either a reason for celebration or for an "Ugh." Actually, either way, it still adds up to an "Ugh," flawlessly performed by the great Mel Blanc himself, in one of his last leading cartoon character roles.Wouldn't it have been weird to be at the network pitch for Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels? "Okay, there's this caveman guy, but he's a super hero that's been trapped in ice for about 2 million years until these shapely young detectives, who happen to be exploring the frozen north in their miniskirts, discover him and he helps them solve mysteries..."No, it's not another Scooby Doo. Not exactly. It's like Charlie's Angels but with a hairy caveman instead of David Doyle..."Let me put it another way..."In 1977, Charlie's Angels was all the rage, along with disco music and Star Wars. Hanna-Barbera worked both into several cartoons of the era, including another series you may think you dreamed but really happened called Casper and the Angels (which I kind of liked anyway). Even Yogi Bear eventually flew into the galaxy and visited floating space discos. (You didn't dream that, either.)Captain Caveman looks like one of the Slag Brothers from Wacky Races and must have been the most fun element of the show to animate. Being composed of lines and scribbles, he was the seven dwarfs to the more naturalistic Teen Angels, who presented more of an animation challenge, as with Snow White (this may be the first time Captain Caveman has been compared to Snow White.)Therefore, sometimes the Teen Angels look wonderful, striking the poses on the model sheets at one moment, but look awkward the next. Such is the result of breakneck production speed at limited budgets, especially when you consider that Captain Caveman was a ten-minute segment sandwiched into the two-hour Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics.In its premiere year, the two-hour block contained a segment of Laff-A-Lympics, a Scooby Dooadventure, a Captain Caveman and another Laff-A-Lympics. The Scooby segments have been released as the "lost" third season. You can even find pretty much all of the Laff-A-Lympics on various DVDs, and can re-create your Saturday morning paradise. I would suggest frying some bacon to make it a multi-sensory experience.A few more Captain Caveman shorts were made for the second season, retitled Scooby's All-Stars.You could also root for Cavey and the Angels as competitors on the "Scoobie-Doobies" team in the Laff-A-Lympics segments. In Spring 1980, the Captain got his own half hour. The DVD set pairs two stories into 20 half-hours; 40 total cartoons. This is likely the way the series was packaged for syndication and cable.Clearly this was a satisfactory, if not phenomenal, success for Hanna-Barbera and ABC. A board game, coloring books, comics and other merchandise graced the store shelves. I even have a card game that features Cavey, Taffy, Brenda and Dee Dee.The three Angels don't get much time to develop character aspects in the short episodes. The premise itself, in HB tradition, is spelled out during the theme song in 30 seconds by none other than Gary Owens. Like Charlie's Angels, there is a "smart one" in this trio - that would be Dee Dee. (Remember the wonderful Vernee Watson? I recall seeing her as the Bachlorette on The Dating Game!) Brenda comes up with wacky plans and schemes and is voiced by Marilyn Schreffler, who also played Olive Oyl around this time. Taffy (Laurel Page) flirts with Cavey to get him to do brave deeds.Cavey yells his name a lot. I would imagine millions of kids did, too, though Blanc's performance of the yell is clearly the same one used over and over. Also used a lot is a transition device with a window and other things flying at the camera. Because of the brevity of each story, they all start with a Teen Angel exposition line: "Well, here we are on a Mississippi Riverboat!" "Golly, it's groovy to be here in New York City!" It is recommended that a few Captain Caveman episodes be savored at a time, instead of binge viewing, because of these patterns.There is no real theme song, just some of the background music with Owens, telling us how hilarious and sometimes scary it's going to be. The first and second season end titles, at least on the DVD set, come from the tail end of Laff-A-Lympics and look like the type was laid over that spin art some of us used to make at the carnival.The third season end titles have a country sound to them with different credits. There are some fun stories in the mix, including one that finds the Teen Angels back in time to meet Cavey's parents. Unlike Scooby Doo mysteries, which are always supernatural in theme, the stories here are also about jewel robberies and smuggling rings without as many of those disguised ghosts that can inexplicably fly through the air and pick up solid objects even though they turn out to be 16mm films with crude little sound systems.Zoinks, I'm getting nostalgic.

 <p> At last, the long-awaited release of all 40 episodes of Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels on DVD by Warner Archive!!! The picture quality is excellent for a 36-year-old cartoon!!! If you're a Hanna-Barbera fan or even a child of the 1970s, you'll appreciate this wonderful set for nostalgic purposes and it's another great addition to your Hanna-Barbera Classic Collection!!! I haven't seen this show since the 1980s and re-watching the episodes brought back a lot of great memories!!!! The first 24 episodes originally aired as a segment on "Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics" (1977-79) and the remaining 16 episodes were broadcast in its own half-hour timeslot in 1980. </p>

 <p> Captain Caaaaavvvvvveeeeee Maaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnn.......I Just Love this Character, and wished to see more seasons of this cartoon.......Hopefully in some Scooby Doo Cartoon Series Episodes, or the Next Scooby Doo Movies, they'll bring one or two mysteries, where they'll be teaming up with Captain Caveman and The Teen Angels.....that'll be TOOOO FUNNY......Imagine how funny it would be, when they'll have to split up into different groups to look for Clues, where Fred and the Girls go that way, the Teen Angels go the other, and all that is left are Shaggy, Scooby and the Captain Caveman.....And Ofcourse, Captain Caveman will put down anything in this mouth, so Shaggy & Scooby better be careful with their food.....Lolz. </p>

 <p> It's the catch phrase voiced by Mel Blanc the legendary voice artist we all grew up with and loved. Now Warner Archive has finally gotten around to releasing this long lost animated gem. If it were the Warner Bros main branch label no doubt we would have had Season One part 1 with 10 episodes and they would have milked it into 4 releases but luckily WA stepped to the plate and released the whole series of Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels in one go. True the episodes are burned onto DVD-Rs so some may have trouble playing them on PCs or DVD recorder devices but on my end I have never had any problem playing the WAC animated releases, the picture looks great for it's age and the cartoon still cracks me up to this day, pure Hanna Barbara goodness!  Here are the list of episodes for those who are curious and the original air dates. This dvd set is highly recommended by "THE" Retroman!1st Season 1977  (part of Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics)1- 1 10 Sep 77 The Kooky Case of the Cryptic Keys1- 2 17 Sep 77 The Mixed Up Mystery of Deadman's Reef1- 3 24 Sep 77 What a Flight for a Fight1- 4 1 Oct 77 The Creepy Case of the Creaky Charter Boat1- 5 8 Oct 77 Big Scare in the Big Top1- 6 15 Oct 77 Double Dribble Riddle1- 7 22 Oct 77 The Crazy Case of the Tell-Tale Tape1- 8 29 Oct 77 The Creepy Claw Caper1- 9 5 Nov 77 Cavey and the Kabuta Clue1-10 12 Nov 77 Cavey and the Weirdo Wolfman1-11 19 Nov 77 The Disappearing Elephant Mystery1-12 26 Nov 77 The Fur Freight Fright1-13 3 Dec 77 Ride 'Em Caveman1-14 10 Dec 77 The Strange Case of the Creature from Space1-15 17 Dec 77 The Mystery Mansion Mix-Up1-16 24 Dec 77 Playing Footsie with Bigfoot2nd Season 1978 (part of Scooby's All-Stars)2- 1 9 Sep 78 Disco Cavey2- 2 16 Sep 78 Muscle-Bound Cavey2- 3 23 Sep 78 Cavey's Crazy Car Caper2- 4 30 Sep 78 Cavey's Mexicali 5002- 5 7 Oct 78 Wild West Cavey2- 6 14 Oct 78 Cavey's WInter Carnival Caper2- 7 21 Oct 78 Cavey's Fashion Fiasco2- 8 28 Oct 78 Cavey's Missing Missile Miss-tery3rd Season 19803- 1 8 Mar 80 The Scarifying Seaweed Secret3- 2 15 Mar 80 The Dummy3- 3 22 Mar 80 Cavey and the Volcanic Villain3- 4 29 Mar 80 Prehistoric Panic3- 5 5 Apr 80 Cavey and the Baffling Buffalo Man3- 6 12 Apr 80 Dragonhead3- 7 19 Apr 80 Cavey and the Murky Mississippi Mystery3- 8 26 Apr 80 Old Cavey in New York3- 9 3 May 80 The Albino Rhino3-10 10 May 80 Kentucky Cavey3-11 17 May 80 Cavey Goes to College3-12 24 May 80 The Haunting of Hog's Hollow3-13 31 May 80 The Legend of Devil's Run3-14 7 Jun 80 The Mystery of the Meandering Mummy3-15 14 Jun 80 The Old Caveman and the Sea3-16 21 Jun 80 Lights, Camera...

 <p> Who would ever have imagined during those glorious days of childhood that one day, thanks to current technology,. we would be able to OWN these fantastic shows!!!! To watch over and over again; an embarrassment of riches for sure! I don't think there are any HB shows I do not own, but if there are, that will be rectified SOON! This one (and The Roman Holidays, which I ADORE) are my favorites. Yes, you CAN go home again, get this DVD&lt; if you've never met the Captain now is the time to get acquainted! Enjoy! </p>
