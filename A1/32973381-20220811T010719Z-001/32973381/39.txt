 <p> This TV will change the way you view TV forever. I placed it in the family room for the whole family, but I found out I should have placed it in my room. The picture is out of this world, but the sound in horrible. I added a surround sound system and now it's wonderful. It really made me into a couch potatoe and I am the person who runs everyday. I had to make myself get up and away from the TV and start living my life again. But, I love the TV, the price (got it from Amazon on Black Friday, extra stars) and the white glove service was great. I didn't have to do a thing but pay for it and open the door for the men to set it up and they took away the carton it came in.PS.The Touch of Red, really makes this TV totally different than the rest. Everyone notice to Red around the TV before the TV goes on. It demands attention!!!! </p>

 <p> I teach film and wanted something that would enhance my viewing experience without overwhelming my medium sized, 14 wide by 20 living area. This TV is perfect and the sound, unlike some of the smaller Samsungs, is very good. While not the theatrical surround sound experience, the down facing speakers work well and produce realistic tones whether you are listening to voice or music. They also allow for a clean appearance which is further enhanced by the touch of red screen. If you are not the techie type and cringe at hooking up one more wire or don't want to lay out another $500 on sound, you should be quite happy with this set just the way it is.My couch is about 12 feet from the screen, while the arm chairs go as close as 6. I find this distance just about perfect for watching the 50 inch screen. I've even had a few friends comment that they almost felt dizzy watching large, fast moving, objects on the screen. If you are wondering how big to go, I personally don't think paying $$$ for an inch or two more will make a difference unless you have a very large room and want to bump up to 60 or 65". The kids should be adequately wowed by their video games on this one. I also like the set of video connectors on the side of the TV which allow you to connect cameras and other devices without having to get to the back of the set.My TV arrived fully assembled in the box. No struggling to get the base on. Amazon offered free white glove delivery and the gentleman placed the TV on my stand without so much as leaving a finger print on the frame or screen. Since the TV is quite heavy this was good to have. He also told me about adding a "line filter" to remove sine waves from the AC as he said some clients encountered small squiggly lines on their screen. Luckily the power center I bought already had digital filters on all the lines.BTW that power center is the Belkin PureAV F9A1033fc10 from Amazon. I also purchased a SONY HDMI cable which you need to connect your DVD player and sometimes the Cable TV to your TV. HDMI is a much higher standard of connector and DOES make a huge difference in quality over traditional RCA connectors. Most local dealers carry MONSTER brand cables. I have found them to be no better or worse than the high quality devices provided by the above vendors. The only thing MONSTER about them is the price!!I should add that CEVA was the company that delivered the TV and sent a very polite and knowledgable man to do it. He even disposed of the box and all of the packing for me. I'd never heard of the company before but I was able to communicate with them about the details of delivery by speaking directly to a rep at their local New Orleans area warehouse. Hurricane Gustav was in the Gulf at that time so a timely delivery was important to me. I would recommend this company to others.I've had the set for two months and use it with a new Sony s350 Blu-ray player. The only problem I've had so far is not wanting to leave home!! Great product.UPDATE: It has been a year since this TV was delivered and I still LOVE it. No complaints. People often worry about plasmas burning in images on the screen. I haven't had that issue and my Wii game system is designed to comphensate for that when a program is left running and unattended. I would imagine most systems are. I am thinking of getting a small Samsung for my bedroom. </p>

 <p> I purchased this set a week or so ago and received it one day prior to the big ice storm here in the North East.Amazon white glove delivery is exceptional and the guys stayed around until we got the set mounted on my stand.  This took awhile but they hung in there I needed their lifting power.The set was easy to set up and the picture in Dynamic mode makes you think you are in the NFL stadium of your choice.  I am currently watching the Steelers and Ravens and have never seen anything like this.My wife watched Garfield a tale of two kitties and could not take her eyes off the set.  It blew her away.Attached a Blue Ray DVD with ease and Iron Man was amazing.Attached my wireless head phones and they worked without a hitch.We have been out of power three times but never had a problem with this TV when it came up.The bottom line is Samsung has produced one heck of a product and Amazon delivers as you would expect.Fred </p>

 <p> Pros: Good picture, lots of inputs. Works well with my PC (DVI to HDMI cable). Cons: Gets a little hot. Menu kinda sucks. When you turn on the TV it doesn't go to the active input. You have to scroll with the remote everytime. Sound is ok, but i never expect too much from TV speakers. For the price this is a better choice than a Panasonic, imo. I've had it for 3 months now. Amazon white glove delivery was great. </p>

 <p> I currently own an LG 42 plasma that I bought over 2 yrs ago that works fine, however I don't get the full 1080P that I need to play my Blu Ray movies and have the full high definition I now want.  For the last two years the LG was good, and still is as far as colors and quality.  However its time for me to upgrade and I have looked into all different models and brands and I must say that after comparing the newest technology on LCD screens and the recent models of plasma, I am still drawn to the color quality of the plasma.  I never had to worry about burn in with my LG, so i am certain that on this newer model of plasma tv it will not be an issue as well.  I ordered this item from Amazon warehouse store refurbished by the manufacturer due to the $300 difference on the price, and carries a warranty as well so I have no concerns.  I always try to find the best deals when shopping for electornics, and I am not afraid of refurbished items specially when they're from the manufacturer.After comparing this tv with others within its price range, not only on specs but on image quality as well, I must say that this tv is the right choice for true image quality.  I dont have to pay extra for an LCD that has 120hz or anything like lag cause plasmas dont have that problem, and I actually get to enjoy the color quality as it was meant to be seen, realistic.I do have a small samsung LCD tv for my bedroom that I purchased over 3 yrs ago refurbished and it is still good and the image is bright and clear, but the colors are not there like on the plasma.I will update this post once I receive my plasma from Amazon as I just placed my order after 3 months of research and waiting for prices to drop.Update:I just received my tv and I was impressed with the service provided by the shipping company, prompt and professional.  The TV itself is amazing as expected, and i did notice the buzzing sound some people mentioned on their reviews, but its only when volume is low and I was messing with the settings for the picture.  I have no regrets and for the price, you can't go wrong. </p>

 <p> This is a great TV.  I did ton's of research before I settled on this TV.  It was between this and the Panasonic Viera TV with THX certification.  The panasonic was more expensive.  I went and looked at both side by side and could not tell the difference between the 2.  The red "touch of color" is very subtle, and not an issue.  This TV is phenominal! </p>

 <p> First  off, did a bit of research before purchase; plasma vs. LCD, and am truly happy that I went for the plasma.  But what made this purchase really great was the delivery and set-up with Prime.  They provided tracking along with a delivery time of day in order to unpack and set up the TV to insure it was working properly.  Oh, did I mention that I saved hundreds of dollars, not to mention sales tax, by getting this thru Amazon! </p>

 <p> Bought this TV through Amazon, order and delivery were as expected - very good.The TV is great with HD programming, but I will say SD broadcasts are not very good on my set.  I have not purchased my Blu Ray player as yet, nor my sound system, but the audio is ok from the set - not nearly as bad as I was expecting based on the reviews.  Overall I am please with the set, the setup menu's are intuitive, the info link is nice, and I continue to receive top notch purchasing experiences from Amazon.One drawback, I typically only view about 1 hour of Television a day, but since I've received this set it is hard to pull myself away from it.  I know, so why the heck did I buy it?...  I love sports, and sports in HD is simply awesome.  Oh, and the food channel, be careful, looking at that stuff in HD can be fattening! </p>

 <p> The picture on this TV is awesome and it looks really good hanging on the wall. I have owned it for just over 3 years and the only issue I have is that the morning news puts its logo in the corner of the screen and it eventually burnt the logo image onto my screen. I have used this TV for video games and then immediately used the scrolling screen burn protecter to remove any screen burn images. The morning news snuck by and now the Fox 59 logo is a permanent part of my TV screen. It is very faint and only shows when there is a light background but it is still annoying. Overall it is a good TV but if I were to buy again I would buy an LED TV. </p>

 <p> As many of you, I too spent many many hours researching HDTV's... I visited BB, CC, Walmart, Frys, many forums, avfourms, cnet, Amazon reviews, etc.. I was determined to get an LCD as I have always heard the negatives to plasmas. ie - screen glare, burn in, bad pixles, dark colors, etc.. I did not really even give plasmas a thought.I was ready to pull the trigger on the LN52A750 but wanted to see the price drop.  While waiting for a price drop I started to look at the plasma screens in Frys. They put the Samsung 50 plasma next to the 52 LCD. I was blown away at the difference in pic quality vs price.  I started to research the plamas. Came down to the usual Panasonic, Pioneer, Samsung. Pioneer was great, but not sure I watch tv enough to feel I next a slight shade darker black for $700 more..I looked at all the reviews for the Samsung plasma, good luck finding a bad one. And if you do, it is an isoated reason.  You find many bad reviews on the LCD.  Screen ghosting, glare, flickering, 120hz issues, cartoon looking, too bright, frame cracking, etc..Aster seeing the plasma and LCD side by side, I felt the plasma was a better image, better colors, exact same bells and whistles.  The plasma was $1000 less than the LCD. It was common sense at that point.Pulled the trigger on the plasma on 1/23 via Amazon. Free white glove. Pilot shipping called me NEXT DAY to set up delivery. They were going to deliver EARLY then of course bad weather hit and I ended up getting it on time..life is tuff.  Piolt was great! 2 drivers set up the tv, test it, bery helpful.I have been overwhelming happy with the plasma. Screen glare is not there, I have double doors in the back right of room and can see no glare. The tv pixels are great, do not see a bad one. Sound is actually better then expected. Great for normal viewing. I do have a seperate 5.1 surround sys, but have not even hooked up yet.PS3 bluray is a killer. I will never go to a movie theatre again..Games a great, movies are outstanding. Watched Wall-E first, great color.I searched  avforums and tvtweak for calibration settings. Both had them. I used middle both settings for a starting point.  I did buy DVE HD Basics calibration disk from Amazon. In the process of setting up now.  I am not sure I like the disk yet. It is very educational about HD, but I would prefer it be more direct and calibration related. I really do not care about the CRT history and why developers made ea setting. I just want my tv calibrated. So I recommend you research before buying this DVD. Unless you do want to learn the history to HDTV.Also, I do have Dish network, no remote issues as I have read before. Works great. I do have the newest firmware, mace with highest version already installed, do not have to upgrade. My tv was built in JAN 09!!I love this tv and am really glade I went with the plasma and not the LCD. The savings alone paid for the PS3 Bluray, and I can still get games, movies, etc.. for the cost of an LCD.LCD is newer technology, does not mean better... </p>

 <p> Samsung PN50A650 Review </p>

 <p> I am not one make a large purchase spur of the moment.  I did alot of homework and visited the electronics stores multiple times looking over all the Plasma's and their attributes.  After doing all of my homework, this was absolutely the best plasma on the market for the money.  Consumer Reports lists the 550 model as #1, but the 650 (rated #3) has the anti-glare screen and additional HDMI inputs (as well as the Samsung Touch of Color feature).  Cnet also highly rated this TV.Now that I have it in my house, the picture is even better than I anticipated.  Awesome high def picture. </p>
