<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> Having released two albums that have sold by the truckload - "No Angel" and "Life for Rent" - this is Dido's first live offering : a DVD and a CD looking back to three dates played at London's Brixton Academy in August 2004.The DVD features 17 tracks - 9 of them lifted from "Life for Rent" while the remaining 8 appeared on "No Angel". With the exception of "This Land is Mine" and "My Lover's Gone", all my favourite Dido songs appear are here. It opens with "Stoned", and the Roswell High song, "Here With Me". The stories behind "See You When You're 40", "Life for Rent", "Mary's in India" and "Sand in my Shoes" are briefly told - though, where appropriate, the names have been omitted to protect the 'innocent'. Unfortunately, nothing was said on the story behind "Isobel" - I've always been curious about that one. Meanwhile, the famously sampled "Thank You" and, to a lesser extent, "White Flag" get the 'big song-along' treatment.It may seem an odd thing to say, given that she is a professional performer, but Dido does seem to be very comfortable on-stage. Unlike some artists I've seen, there's no obvious signs of ego, general vanity or grumpiness - the intros and links between the songs seen more like an informal chat. The camera work and the lighting are excellent, while there are a couple of characters in the band - Keith Golden, the bass guitarist, appears to be one of those kids who likes doing his own thing. There's also (if you look closely) an appearance by Animal from "The Muppet Show"...The CD features 12 of the tracks from the concert, and lasts for nearly an hour. "Don't Leave Home", "Do You Have a Little Time", "Hunter", "My Life" and (oddly, I thought) "All You Want" are the five songs that were dropped, while the intros also missed the cut. Without the 'distractions' of the stage show, the CD emphasises just how good Dido is live.Neither the CD nor the DVD contain any new material, so I wouldn't expect this release to win any new fans - if you hated "No Angel" and "Life for Rent" there's really no point in buying this. However, if you're a fan, it's definitely recommended. Slip it into your DVD player, rest your feet on your coffee-table and enjoy ! </p>

 <p> If I were to have one complaint about Dido, it would be her studio tracks are a little *too* laid back and they sometimes get monotonous if you're not in the mood for them.  Nevertheless, I love her songwriting and she ranks with up there with Poe as far as lyrical excellence is concerned.  Her lyrics are subtle, sophisticated, and well-crafted.  Here on her live DVD, my one complaint towards her is revoked, removed, and I've re-experienced Dido at her finest.  Her live performance is where the missing spark can be found; her energy comes through blasting and blaring and she takes you for a memorable ride.As a casual fan, what surprised me was her undeniable charm and charisma.  Along with her energy, these elements of her just don't come through on her studio albums nor in her videos.  She's also got quite a facetious, lively sense of humor (which she shares with the audience between songs).  This makes the music that much more accessible.  I found I didn't need to be 'in the mood' for her music to watch her concert.  Like her music, Dido herself is captivating in a subdued, subtle manner.  The band, the singing were all top-notch and I have no complaints about the music.  Dido, her band, and the audience all looked as if they were having the time of their lives, and it definitely shows.  The music was all terrific, and so good was this concert that it prompted me to re-visit some songs I didn't particularly like and give them a second chance after seeing it live on the DVD.  That's a sure sign a concert was a winner for me.Fans of Dido will not want to miss banter and conversations that happen in between songs.  She shares (briefly) some information about the song she's going to sing next, which is quite nice.  She never gets too carried away (y'know how some singer-songwriters make less and less sense the more they talk about their song?) and always stays grounded and makes complete sense.  Surprisingly, she's also quite funny!  (And guys, my husband watched this DVD and he assures me she's quite hot, as well.)Now, on to a very important reason I love this DVD: no. psychotic. editing!  (Yay!  Yay!  Yay!)  After being so very, very, very disappointed with Sheryl Crow's "C'mon America" and Sarah McLachlan's "Afterglow Live," I was afraid Dido's DVD was going to follow the 'nauseatingly choppy and twirly rockstar' trend.  (Note: I love those two ladies and I thought their performances were top-notch.  This isn't an attack on Sheryl or Sarah's performances--I just couldn't stand editing of the video) I've said repeatedly on Amazon that I wish that trend would die because I literally get motion sick watching concerts that do their editing that way (where the camera doesn't linger on any one shot for more than 5 seconds) and those DVDs are absolutely unwatchable.  (I'm 24, so no, it's not an age issue.)  So, if you can sympathize with this, fear not!  Dido has not succumbed and this DVD is more than watchable.  The only complaint I can see is that the video quality isn't crystal clear.  It reminded me a bit of Sarah McLachlan's 'Mirrorball.'  I, however, enjoyed the look of it because it lent a certain atmosphere and feel to the DVD that complemented it very well.Ever since Sarah McLachlan's 'Mirrorball,' I haven't found a concert DVD that's compelled me to watch and re-watch a concert as often as I did with 'Mirrorball.'  Dido's done it for me, though, and it's quite a pleasure to see her perform.  This is one of the concerts that will get watched often in my house.  I will be anxiously awaiting her next CD, DVD, tour, etc. </p>

 <p> I had heard DIDO on the radio, but never could get her name. I read somebody else's review here in Amazon, and I'm glad that I got this DVD, which to my surprise, included also a CD.Dido Armstrong can not only sing and write her songs, but she can really perform on stage. She is just simply beautiful and her looks, talent writing and singing reminded me of a young Christie McVie, when the later performed as a founding member of Fleetood Mac in the 1970's.This live DVD performance is sensual, well recorded with excellent camera works, and does the work to capture Dido performing in a very natural and lose setting. Quite frankly, I didn't know what to expect when I initially bought this DVD, other than being an Amazon review referral, but am I ever glad I bought it. It's in top of my extensive collection of live concert performances which captures the very best of what a live concert should be all about. Play it out in Dolby 5.1 surround. Enjoy! </p>

 <p> I thought I wrote a review of this back when it came out, but I realized recently I didn't. Better late than never, even though it seems it may be out of print currently. Never the less, if you are interested in this, I can't recommend it enough. I still watch it periodically when the mood strikes, 8 years on! Seems to me Dido's studio recordings are a bit over produced and instrumentally lifeless. I've never gotten to see her perform in person, so I was pleasantly surprised that she is fantastic live. Assuming the video doesn't have any post production vocal trickery (no evidence of that that I saw), Dido's voice sounds just as good live as in studio. It's the musicians and live arrangements that really make this concert special, though. The energy and honesty that these songs acquire in concert is amazing. This energy, combined with the extended and modified arrangements make this exactly what a live performance should be: exciting and fun! Technically, the sound is great and nothing about the picture or videography distracts. </p>

 <p> This may sound like the review of a blathering idiot. But for some reason, when I watch the DVD, "Dido Live" it seems to really speak to me. Sounds crazy...right? I mean it's a concert video for goodness sake! A piece of entertainment! Yet, there are some nights, where I just can't sleep. In the dark of the early AM, it seems like the whole world is in bed..sound asleep. On those nights, I'll put this DVD on and it seems to lull me into a twilight trance, all to the magnificent sounds and confessions of singer/songwriter, Dido Armstrong. For anyone who's ever heard Dido's music, you know she is a singer, who gets personal. Dido has a pop/rock sound, augmented with laid back, electonica back-beats. This is all in support of her amazing voice. It's a voice that  seems to just go up and down your spine, causing those little hairs on the back of your neck to stand up. Dido's songs are about her life, love and emotional hurt. This is one performer, who is not afraid to open her life up to you and bares herself emotionally naked. (O.K., I'm definitely in blathering idiot mode!) In this concert DVD, she performs live in front of a couple thousand cheering fans at London's Brixton Academy. But even though she's in front of a large crowd, she seems to engage the viewer personally with her friendly, song introductions, her confessional, tell-all song lyrics and a lively musical performance, backed by an excellent group of musicians. Dido is just one of those performers, who really reaches down somewhere in herself and puts it all out there in her performance. The DVD includes many of her hits from the two CDs in her discography, including "White Flag", "Life For Rent", Don't Leave Home", "Sand in My Shoes" and "Thank You". The sound and picture on this DVD is wonderfully remastered. The DVD package also includes a shortened audio CD. But between the two, the DVD is the way to really experience this concert. I love this DVD and I'm sure I'll spend more sleepless nights experiencing it! Highly recommended! </p>

 <p> Dido Puts It All Out There...on  Stage </p>


<h2> review.date </h2>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> If you've read the other reviews, you might recognize the title I chose. "It'll blow you away." I stole that from Jonathan Koe's review. Thanks, J.K., please don't sue me...my net worth is about $1.98, and that's only on payday. Also, this DVD is in widescreen (1.78:1, I believe), rather than the 1.33:1 (full screen mode) that this site says it's in. There are no Dvd extras, but you do get a song selection list that lets you jump to any of the 17 songs, instantly.I listened to this Dvd in Dolby 2.0 channel stereo and it sounded amazing through my 4 speakers. It's also in Dolby 5.1 and DTS 5.1 Stereo Surround (which you can select with your Dvd remote).I enjoyed the brief but clever opening, featuring lighted cars whizzing along night roads, a sunset, and the path taken through part of the Brixton Academy (London) where this was filmed. I also liked Dido's comments about the origins of some of her songs, which she talks about just before she sings them in the concert.Although, what's very odd, is that the first time I watched this concert, for the first 47 minutes or so, I was NOT blown away at all. In fact, I was quite annoyed. First of all, I wanted to see Dido! Not a Dido bathed in white light, than blue, green, pink, purple, turquoise...I think I imagined some of the colors, but when the stage turned red and two beams of red light from above the stage, focused on Dido, while she sang the words, "Take Me Home", during the opening song, "Stoned"; I was positive aliens were about to beam her to their mother ship. Luckily, this didn't happen, but I was still a bit shaken and was pretty sure I was only going to give this DVD 3 stars.You could call this concert, "Dido's Electric Light Orchestra Extravaganza." It all looked cool enough and was very stylish and clever, but I was waiting for the light show to end, so I could concentrate on the hottie on the stage, rather than all the hot lights.Secondly, I kept trying to figure out if Dido had a cold or not? One reviewer was so sure she had one, that for the one brief second I thought she sounded a bit congested, I thought she actually might start sneezing.However, I finally realized that even if she had a cold, I wasn't going to be able to notice, so I just sat patiently, listening to her wonderful, yet perhaps, slightly sick voice (just kidding), as she sang  her heart out. I've seen her on tv and listened to enough of her songs to know that she could sing beautifully, so I still wasn't blown away.It was all just too much for my little brain to grasp. It was way over my head and too advanced a show for me to fully appreciate upon first viewing. I was expecting something like a "Natasha Beddingfield: Live in N.Y. City" concert, mixed with some of the "Jewel: Live at Humphrey's by the Bay" concert.Instead, what I got, was a brilliantly and cleverly filmed light show, that happened to feature a wonderful singer named Dido, and superbly talented musicians, using a wide variety of instruments and strange objects (some most likely never used in a concert before, or certainly not that often), to entertain and dazzle the audience. I thought the glow-in-the-dark, green drumsticks, were a nice touch, but would someone please tell the bass guitar player to never wear a Detroit Piston basketball jersey while on stage. He looked so out of place.It wasn't until chapter 10 (about 48 minutes into this 90 minute concert) that I got something I was expecting and waiting for. Dido playing her guitar, while singing "Mary's in India". No flashy light show, just a girl and her guitar. That was the Jewel part of the show, and a few more like it, were to come later on.After that, I was hooked. I went back and watched some of the previous songs again ("See You When Your 40" {my 4th favorite}, "Isobel" {3rd favorite}, etc.), and enjoyed them much more. At that moment, I realized that this was a four star Dvd, at least. I then watched "Mary's in India" (my 5th favorite) once more, then a nice rendition of "Take my Hand" followed it, as well as an infectious version of "Thank You" (my 2nd favorite performance on this Dvd). Three more songs were sung, and then came "All I Want"(my favorite performance) and "See the Sun", to end the concert. Dido shouts, "Thank you London", and leaves the stage.No Dido, Thank you!Throughout the entire concert, the marvellous lighting crew, added so much to virtually every song, but I guess I was just too distracted and overwhelmed by it all at first, to really appreciate what they were doing. I couldn't connect with Dido, because it was hard to see her. Even when she started introducing her songs, she still seemed like a stranger to me. Had they started with "Mary's in India", or any song that didn't constantly feature blue or white light always on her face, I would have had a much easier time enjoying everything, right away.I now enjoy every performance, because the second half of the concert made it easier for me to connect with Dido. For example, the last two songs of the concert, "All You Want" and "See the Sun", still had plenty of lighting effects, but they were not overwhelming, unlike the ones during "Stoned" (it does look cool though, and I now like it). The vocal performances and varied camera angles for the last two songs are good enough on their own, but when the beautiful pink stage lights slowly turn on, during "All I Want", I can't help but say, "Wow", each and every time I watch it. The green lighting that later bathes the stage during that song, also looks amazing! As well, the golden lighting for "See the Sun", is also brilliantly timed and presented in several different ways (such as the perfectly timed golden light flashes, appearing each of the two times Dido strums her guitar, during a close-up).So, special thanks to the Lighting Crew Chief: Andrew Beller, and the Lighting crew: Edward Jackson and Robert Gawler. Also, to Andi Watson, for his set and lighting design. Sorry I didn't get what you were doing the first time around, but now I know better. Pure genius! Repeat viewing is a must to fully appreciate everything that's packed into this concert! 5 stars!You were right J.K., I was blown away, after all. Thanks. </p>

 <p> Dido is one of the few singer/song writers that always leaves you wanting more. Her songs are like poetry made especially for you. I have been a fan of hers since I heard Here with Me on Roswell. I wasn't a fan of her music videos and I waited soo long for the 2nd album. I loved it. Every emotion I have ever felt was written into the songs with perfection. I searched for when a third album would be released and I saw that this special edition dvd was coming out. As always I went to Best Buy before they opened to be sure to get a copy.The dvd showed what a real talent she is. Dressed modestly and ready to share her songs with London she takes the crowd's breath away. One of the best things about this dvd is that she gives a little bit of info on each song. Like for instance Don't Leave Home is not a love ballad. It's a song about addiction. She says that some people play this song at their wedding and she laughs about it. I would too, knowing that. And Mary's in India is about a real friend who traveled. And she experienced some trouble with the release on White Flag because it's about her relationship ending.Dido's voice is soothing and she just appears to be a real person with real problems and to cope with it all she writes songs and it just so happens that she's good at it. The camera angles are great cause they center on her and it's not a big production- it's like you have the front row to a great concert.I don't know a single person who says "I don't like Dido's music" after they listen to her albums. It's impossible. When someone close to me died I listened to See the Sun over and over. The words made me feel not alone.The dvd also comes with a live cd. This is great because the live performance of See You When You're 40 is played with a great intensity and it's much better live. This dvd is great and if you love Dido's music you must see her perform. It is a treat. She doesn't do a lot of touring here in the U.S. so this is as good as seeing her in person. </p>

 <p> Like one of the other reviewers, I am totally captivated by Dido's performance in this concert video...both her songs and how she interacts with the audience between songs. Also, like another reviewer, I am thrilled by the minimalist style of editing used here.  This is the way a concert should be filmed!  I don't want to feel motion sickness when I'm watching a video!  I don't want to be at the mercy of a video editor on steroids!  I want to be pulled into the music...pulled into the performance and the performer.  And that's what this video does.  Thank you, Dido and your team, for choosing to make this video so very watchable!  Lastly, I was not familiar with all the songs Dido sings...and I was very pleasantly surprised by how good all the ones that don't get regular air play on the radio are.  You won't regret buying this video. </p>

 <p> If you like Dido, you need this DVD/CD. The band is excellent. Dido's voice is smooth and soothing as usual, and the more you watch the concert, the more you will like the music. The addition of back-up singers would be a real plus in my opinion, but all in all, a great performance. </p>

 <p> I like everything I've heard by Dido. She has a great, smoky voice and all of her songs performed here are deeply beautiful. It's good to finally see how she is in a live setting. Unfortunately, the widescreen image is heavily processed with a soft focus throughout, which I detest. Still, she looks terrific and the audio quality is generally good. Mmmm, and I especially love her performance here of "Take My Hand" - I wouldn't mind being her "microphone" during it, ohhhhhh baby.....BEWARE!!! ATTENTION!!! READ THIS!! - DO NOT LOAD THE LIVE MUSIC CD INTO YOUR PC. IT CONTAINS SUNNCOMM / MEDIAMAX SONYBMG ROOTKIT SPYWARE, WHICH WILL SCREW YOUR SYSTEM UP! DAMN THESE COMPANIES TO HELL! </p>

 <p> This audio and visual DVD/CD set was a gift, not a purchase I would have made myself. I have been a Dido fan for some years now, but I never purchase DVDs of concerts because, for me, music is about listening, not watching. I can almost say I find visuals distracting when I wish only to float away on a note. I've long felt the upsurge of music videos has only encouraged musicians and their promoters to think more about their appearance than their actual musical talent. And so, I watched the DVD once, to have seen it, and doubt I will again.All that said, I did enjoy watching the concert, and it did add something to my future listening to the CD. The positives I learned from watching Dido perform were an added notch to my respect for this artist: she apparently isn't about appearance, but is all about her music. How refreshing to not have to wince at all the ridiculous costuming of those such as Cher or Spears or Madonna and so many others, but simply a young, fresh-faced woman in jeans and silk camisole like your neighbor would wear, with all her focus on her singing.  No choreographed dance steps, no fireworks, no changing stage sets, just music, Dido, her band, and more music. Nice. I also enjoyed her short commentaries between songs.To the music then. When I first plugged the CD into my top notch car stereo on my long morning commute to work, the sound flooded my car and my memory. It was pretty much the same music that I had listened to for days on end on a recent road trip crosscountry from Michigan to New Mexico and back. That CD was Dido's "Life for Rent," almost all the same tracks, except that was studio-recorded, this was live. Such is the power of good music that although I was now listening to it on a snowy winter morning in Michigan, I was instantly transported to a blazing sunny afternoon crossing the orange mesas of New Mexico, alongside the Rockies, and my mood, too, was transported back to that listener of months ago, rocked alongside a mirroring voice in Dido. This recording has the messy edges of a live performance, at times even distorted, and there were places in it that made me miss the nuanced instrumentation of the studio version. The live sound was not nearly as clean and clear. Too much background noise, too much static, too much blurring of voices and instruments, and sometimes Dido was buried under loud over-layering of instrumentation.  But I've enjoyed hearing the differences - between studio and live - and I must say each version has its pros and cons. I expect I'll be listening to both on and off, as the mood and the road strike me. </p>
