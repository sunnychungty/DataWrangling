 <p> Written/directed by Paul Morrissey and set primarily in a villa in Italy,ANDY WARHOL'S DRACULAhas some inspired casting. On the other hand, skin flick specialist Joe D. may look handsome here, but that New Yawk accent is laughable! Joe plays a Socialist peasant who awaits the Russian Revolution's arrival in Italy. Only then will noble families like the one he works for get their comeuppance. But his ain't da main staw-ree.This movie is known by a half dozen names. The original title, "Dracula cerca sangue di vergine... e mor&igrave; di sete" translates as: "Dracula tries virgin blood... and dies of silks."SYNOPSIS--Romanian Count Dracula (Kier) is ill from locally tainted blood. He travels to Italy with assistant Anton (Jeurging) in search of the "wirginal" variety- the only blood Drac can digest without getting violently sick. They bring with them the Count's casket "bed" and a supply of vegetables that soon runs out.Eager for familial alliance with a rich foreigner, the cash-strapped Il Marchese Di Fiore (Di Sica) who has four daughters, assures Anton they are all good virginal Catholics. The old man doesn't know that his eldest two are a couple of putanas who bang studly servant Mario Balato (Dallesandro) and each other like crazy!The Count visits with these alleged "maidens" one at a time; they innocently tell him they're pure. He responds with world-class hickeys. End result: scenes of ever-worsening sanguinal reflux. A desperately unwell Count is running short on Di Fiore girls and worse, Mario's figured out exactly what he is.This originally 'X' rated work is companion to Warhol's far grosserFRANKENSTEIN(1973).Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(6.2) Andy Warhol's Dracula (Italy/France-1974) - Joe Dallesandro/Udo Kier/Vittorio De Sica/Maxime McKendry/Arno Juerging/Milena Vukotic/Dominique Darel/Stefania Casini/Silvia Dionisio (cameo: Roman Polanski) </p>

 <p> Viewed: 9/13Rate: 89/13: Good Dracula pictures are rare. In fact, it almost never happens. There has been a countless number of bad Dracula pictures. But chalk Blood for Dracula up as one of the fewest real good ones. It is actually an interesting tale; just a bit different. Dracula must have the blood of virgins; otherwise, he will throw up. The Italian servant has an ongoing rebellion against the aristocratic class even though he somehow works for an aristocratic family. And in order to save the life of a virgin from Dracula, she must be immediately deflowered. Blood for Dracula can be considered pornographic at times, which is a bit excessive for a while, thus cheapening itself. However, Paul Morrissey does not lose the focus of the film as he steadily carries the story along from start to finish. The characters are well played by the cast, and they do a good job of bringing an international flavor to Blood for Dracula. The audience can be fooled into thinking that it is a genuine Hammer Horror picture. The murder of Dracula is an interesting twist. So is Joe Dallesandro's brutish character. What film has two of the best directors in business making a rare cameo? Seeing Roman Polanski (with a very amusing game) and Vittorio De Sica is a treat. All in all, Blood for Dracula is one of the better Dracula movies. </p>

 <p> The tag-line for this movie should be changed to &quot;Who Kier's?&quot;.BLOOD FOR DRACULA is a major disappointment, especially compared to its companion film FLESH FOR FRANKENSTEIN. In this painful bore from director Paul Morrissey, Dracula (Udo Kier in a blank, mechanical performance which makes the viewer pine for Christopher Lee or Gary Oldman) heads to England in search of &quot;where-gin&quot; blood. The only problem is, the Count winds up in a house full of promiscuous young women, who are of no use to him. Sounds good so far doesn't it? Well yer wrong bucko!There's not enough blood &amp; gore- especially compared to FLESH FOR FRANKENSTEIN. There's a decent amount of female nudity but nothing that stands out enough to make you want to punish yourself by sitting through the whole movie. This is nowhere near as bad as Warhol/Morrissey's collaborative non-movie TRASH, but it's still no good. The movie is not a recommended starting point if you're a &quot;where-gin&quot; to horror films; even though BLOOD FOR DRACULA is a &quot;horror&quot; in every other sense of the word.If you're after an interesting, original &amp; entertaining vampire film I recommend the 1987 Kathryn Bigelow movie NEAR DARK or the 1974 Hammer film LEGEND OF THE SEVEN GOLDEN VAMPIRES, which successfully combined the horror &amp; kung fu genres. But don't waste your time with this- unless you happen to be a pretentious, quiche-eating ponce. But what would you expect from a movie presented by a guy who managed to turn a Campbell's Soup Can (of all things) into serious &quot;ART&quot;?! (Maybe I should put one of my empty Speights bottles in a glass case and pay gullible schmucks two bucks apiece to look at it).BLOOD FOR DRACULA doesn't really qualify as horror or softcore erotica. Its touches of &quot;humor&quot; aren't  funny, so the end result is a cheap, boring and poorly acted snoozefest. There ARE some boobies but nothing to justify sitting through this. If that's what you're after you'd probably be better off renting ELVIRA: MISTRESS OF THE DARK (even though its a comedy) and pausing the tape at regular intervals. At least we can remain thankful that the Warhol/ Morrissey camp didn't get to have their wicked way with R.L Stevenson's DR JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE or Gaston LeRoux's PHANTOM OF THE OPERA! </p>

 <p> Count Dracula (Udo Kier- THEATRE BIZARRE) and his henchman, Anton must leave their native Romania, due to a shortage of female virgins. The Count must find a virgin or die within a few weeks. The two travel by car to Italy (well known for virgins!). It's humorous to see their vehicle loaded down w/ boxes, bicycles, and Dracula's coffin tied to the car's roof! Once in Italy, a quartet of sisters are quickly located, and a meeting is arranged. Of course, we are aware of something that Dracula is not privy to. We know that not all of the sisters are virgins. In fact, there's a whole lot of monkey business going on at their family castle! This may come as a bit of a shock to Dracula and Anton, since they've been busy plotting their nocturnal attack! Let's just say that non-virginal blood has an extremely bad effect on the Count! Kier is perfect in his toothy role, as are the rest of the cast. BLOOD FOR DRACULA is a soft-core horror parody w/ style. Highly recommended for those seeking something different. Not for the easily offended... P.S.- Watch for the ultra-bloody finale, and see if it doesn't remind you of a certain scene in a certain MONTY PYTHON film!... </p>

 <p> As long as you have someone to talk to during the long drawn out boring moments of dialog between heavy Italian, German, British and Bronx accents (yes, Bronx) , this movie has everything a vampire movie should have. Sex, over the top humor, and lots of blood all over the porcelain...and a little puddle on the floor.Watch this just to see Udo Kier and learn why he is cast in every (decent) vampire movie made since the 80s. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> Paul Morrissey's outrageous takes on the Horror classics in FLESH FOR FRANKENSTEIN and BLOOD FOR DRACULA border on genius and insanity. Shot back-to-back, these experimental film oddities were made on impossibly low budgets and were entirely improvised according to rough script outlines. The results produced two of the most unique, original, and wildly entertaining entries in the genre! BLOOD FOR DRACULA opens with the enfeebled count masking his pallid complexion beneath make-up and hair dye so that he may disguise himself as he travels to Italy in search of a virgin bride. Dracula is taken in by an affluent family with four beautiful young daughters, whom he attempts to court before he is discovered by a perceptive field hand. Udo Kier's Dracula is unlike any other; weak, crippled, and unalluring, he is hardly a reflection of Bram Stoker's powerful and persuasive character that is introduced in the original novel. Morrissey establishes his own set of rules in this version as well, allowing Dracula to walk in the daylight and to eat normal foods amongst many other changes. He still manages to put together elegant sets and locations with what little money he had in order to bring the story to life. The cast had been selected from all over Europe, which adds to the absurdity on-screen when the "Romanian" count and his escort Anton speak in thick German accents, while the "Italian" maidens are unmistakably French. Joe Dallesandro seems all the more out of place as he is transplanted into Italy with his distinct Brooklyn accent, but he commands the screen as the macho womanizer Mario Balato. For not having any lines written for them, the assortment of actors play off of each other brilliantly, stringing together a coherent narrative that gives way to pure camp. Kier and Arno Juerging ham it up as the Count and his assistant, and their eccentric performances are nothing short of hilarious. Each of them repeatedly mispronounce "daughter" and "virgin," confusing the audience with their talk of "doctors" and "wirgins." Because of this form of theatrical filmmaking, many viewers are likely to find the acting, direction, and dialog to be completely off key in their initial viewings, but a closer examination reveals BLOOD FOR DRACULA to be an intelligent and provocative piece of cinematic art that is quite unlike anything else in Horror.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies </p>

 <p> Once in a millenium comes an exceptional movie that preserves the pristine elegance, unmatched charisma, and unbridled sexuality of one of the most revered characters of all time...This is not that movie.Blood for Dracula is an eccentric art film that accidentally bleeds into one campy, wiolent comedy.  Or is it wice-wersa?  Either way, this blood-soaked fang banger is bound to upset many wampire purists.  I for one enjoyed it wery wery much.Kudos to Udo, he is bloody brilliant in this role.  He is the Count, and he has a problem.  He has unfortunately lost the pep in his step from drinking tainted blood.  He travels to Italy to find some pure virgins to suck on.The quest is full of pratfalls, as many of the lovely ladies embellish on their sexual inexperience.  What's a Count to do?Blood for Dracula is full of sex and blood to counteract the senseless plot developments.  A brilliant, artistic twist to the genre.  Fun times!"Vomiting looks great when you've got a tuxedo on." </p>

 <p> SPOILER ALERT!One of the few truly original and distinguished films of the vampire movie genre. It's basically the story of Count Draculas quest for a virgin with whom he can revitalize himself and his relatives ( who are "asleep" in the family crypt back home ) while posing as a wealthy traveling aristocrat in search of a "suiter".  It is dramatic, funny, clever, occasionally gross, and even rather sad and tragic in the end .Though a Dracula film, this isn't the usual type of vampire flick. It's not like ohhhh, .. 'Lost Boys or 'Blade or 'Twilight( I even suspect that some of the bad "reviews" already here are from idiots who had a movie like THOSE in mind with this one ). It's actually a kind of classy film, .. . more like a funny dramatic film with a vampire as it's subject.And, though this film does have it's humorous side, it isn't exactly a "comedy" in any conventional sense either. Put another way, this is NOT, I warn you, anything like ohhhh 'Fright Night, or 'Love At First Bite, or 'Vampire In Brooklyn with Eddy Murphy, or 'Dracula; Dead And Loving It, or 'My Dog is A Vampire, or anything else along THAT line, so get THAT out of your head. The humor in this film is actually rather subtle and more in the nature of ironic satire than "comedy" or even "camp".To give an example of this films humor, there's this one scene ( the opening scene in fact ) in which Drac ( played by the femininely featured actor Udo Kier ) is sitting in front of a mirror and narcisistically primping himself, applying rouge to his callow cheeks, red tint to his lips, and black dye to his blond swept-back hair ( establishing an element of sexual androgyny, .. a theme already common for a Warhol film of course, but pretty novel and unorthodox for a vampire movie in this films time period ). Then the viewer pans over to the mirror, to reveal that he doesn't even have a &#@!^ reflection!! Just clever little bits of subtle irony like that.It's also in some of the dialogue, like "My bed wont fit in the car!".."Then it will ride on top. We'll say it contains the body of a relative.", or when Drac complains about his lodgings, "This room is TERRIBLE!!  It's filled with light!!  And the kitchen here is filled with unpure ( non-virgin ) meat!!", or when Drac urgently pumps a girl about her sexual history "You are a virgin ?!".."Yes.".."Your telling the truth ?!!".."Yes, of course !".."GOOD!!  I believe you!!!",.. and then bites her neck and commences to slurp.For "splatter" fans, this film also has it's share of pretty gross scenes ( which are very cleverly conceived and relevant to the story ), like a scene in which Drac devours a loaf of bread soaked with blood ( gleaned from a young girls gruesome murder scene ) furnished by his sinister but clever servant, who then inquires "How was it? Was she good?" to which Drac replies "Yes!.. . YES!!! It worked!!!  She WAS PURE!!!".The scenes of Drac retching, after drinking tainted ( non-virgin ) blood, are also very gross, .. yet also highly dramatic and somewhat poignant.I will refrain from relating the climax here, but, suffice it to say, it too should please the "splatter" buffs.Udo Kier is excellent in the role of the count.  His sense of misery and desperation is very convincingly conveyed.  Now some might complain that Drac isn't very fearsome and menacing in this film.  He isn't like the villainous and demonic Christopher Lee, and he's sure as he!! not like those teen super-jock vampires in those 'Blade and 'Twilight "masterpieces" ( doing flips, jumping and flying through the air, karate fighting and all that ), in fact, he's rather infirm throughout the whole movie.  However, that's relevant to the story as he's deprived of the virgins blood which would invigorate him,  so you'll have to make allowance for that.Other stand-out roles and performances are by Joe Dallasandro as the macho hero who rescues the imperiled damnsels from the thirsty count "Your the one he wants now!  You aughta ahhh, .. . lose that virginity of your's. Then he cant get to ya."Victoria deSeka as a pretentious and somewhat insane old windbag  "Dracula! .. Dracula ?! .. DRAC-U-LA! .. DRACULA!! .. dracla!".And Arno Jugering ( wonder what maner of name that is ? ) as Drac's creepy sidekick Anton  "How old ARE you ,. .. little girl ?!". </p>

 <p> Even though originally titled, "Andy Warhol's Dracula", this film had very little to do with Andy Warhol. Udo Kier plays a count visitng Italy to satisfy his "special diet", i.e. "virgin blood." Though the royal family's daughters seem promising, Joe Dellesandro (who uses the Andy Warhol style of "non acting")is busy making them ineligible for the Count's requirements. The count's reaction to non virgin blood (in repeat scenes) has to be among the grossest scenes in film, next to the end of Pink Flamingos. Other than that, the movie wanders, the dialogue is dull, the political conflicts unnecesary (remember this was the 70's) and parts of it are closer to soft core porn or badly acted costume drama than horror. Though not as amazingly awful as "Sins of the Fleshapoids" or Ed Wood (who has a certain charm) Blood for Dracula will leave you scratching your head one moment and then turning it away from the screen the next. </p>

 <p> Andy Warhol's Dracula (as this film was originally known) was one of those films I was busting to see as a kid - it was also one of those films I was destined never to see as a kid - it was X rated when X meant sex and gore. Having finally seen this film 31 years after its original release, I'm a)sorry I didn't get a chance to see it then because my youth would have made me think it better than it really is, or b) sorry I waited with such anticipation.Oh, I saw Andy Warhol's Frankenstein many years ago, but for some reason couldn't ever get a copy of his Dracula. ...Frankenstein is over the top and features amateurish acting, but awesome costumes, sets and a really weird premise....Dracula features really amateurish acting, awesome costumes, sets, dynamite soundtrack, and a really logical premise (for a vampire film). The result is disappointing.The only thing that made the horrible acting in Frankenstein palatable was the totally bizarre storyline (which oddly was utilized in The Rocky Horror Picture Show).  Here, we have a relatively mundane storyline that makes complete sense by vampiric standards: Dracula needs virgin blood only...there's none to be found in Romania...he must travel to Italy, where it is believed, because of strong Catholicism there will be more virgins...he ensconses himself with a well to do Italian family and attempts to woo the couple's beautiful daughters in order to drain them dry.  Now, that's the basic premise. After almost 100 years of vampire films (yes, 100 years....), this is a relatively banal storyline. The "gimic" is that if Dracula drinks non-virgin blood, he vomits it back up and we get to see it.  This is hardly very shocking after seeing Dr. Frankenstein have sex via a surgical incision with a revived female body. It's hardly as gory as the veritble Shakespearian slaughter that occurs at the end of ...Frankenstein.Udo Kier, as Dracula, who has amazingly continued to find acting work up to this day even in U.S. films, is a horrible actor.  He overplays most every scene and underplays when he should overplay. Joe Dallesandro as the "handyman," is oddly, a Brooklynese Italian (much as he was oddly a Brooklynese Romanian in ...Frankenstein). He can't act. He is merely an oddity of the old Warhol Factory and a plaything of Warhol's. He doesn't disrobe with the aplomb that he did in ...Frankenstein to reveal all, but he certainly runs around without his clothes on a bit. Since these two actors make up the starring cast, it is refreshing that the supporting cast actually seem to know something about acting - at least much moreso than the supporting cast in ...Frankenstein. However, it is too little too late.By virtue of the fact that this film is so bad, it is also sad, that this film seems to actually have a subliminal message to it about the evils of socialism and how they seek to destroy tradition and values. Dracula, in this allegory actually represents tradition and values whereas the handyman, a Stalinist, represents the destruction of the church and traditional values (as he repeatedly speaks of rape and overthrowing the government).Therefore, it is unfortunate that ...Dracula comes up lacking in the expectation department. Perhaps, one should watch ...Dracula before seeing ...Frankenstein. Otherwise, the viewer's expectations about the films will find them disappointed. </p>

 <p> The strength of this otherwise unfortunate movie is Udo Kier's sterling portrayal of Count Dracula. Envision, if you will, Count Dracula sitting lethargically before a baroque vanity mirror, generously painting black dye over his hoary white hair with a brush large enough to swipe a gutter. This chilling, haunting, otherworldly scene sets the tone for all that follows. Faced with doom and obscurity, Dracula must leave his moribund abode and embark on a secret quest to secure the wirgin blood required to maintain his eternal existence. He must lamentably say farewell to his sister, and then board the family car with chauffeur/evil toady Anton for a lengthy road trip.Operation: 'Wirgin Blood' has now begun.Eventually Dracula is directed to a large estate, where an aged farmer has in his care a whole stable of absolutely hideous daughters. (It should be mentioned that this film's continuity is backwards or inverted, not unlike that of the Crime Syndicate of Amerika; e.g.: hideous daughters are super-hot; Count Dracula, Prince of Darkness, is powerless; the movie's hero is a lowlife Communist/rapist.) The father invites Dracula into his once-lavish home, and proudly confirms the fact that all of his daughters are in fact good, wholesome, corn-fed wirgins. Count Dracula begins to stalk his prey one by one...How does the 'Udo Kier' Dracula differ from the conceptual Dracula?(A) 'Udo' Dracula not only lacks superhuman strength and reflexes, but lacks even the vigor required to fight a frail wine-addled captive wirgin into submission.(B) 'Udo' Dracula has no demonic powers such as augmented senses, shapeshifting or unnatural magnetism; quite in fact the wirgins are repulsed by 'Udo' Dracula and they mock him behind his back.(C) 'Udo' Dracula not only lacks a vampire's powers, but is also vulnerable to any ordinary attack or weapon. You could kill 'Udo' Dracula with a compass, a tire iron, or even a stale loaf of bread if you pummeled him enough times.When Dracula fails in seducing trying to seduce the wirgins, he changes tactics and tries to overpower them physically. Eventually, one of the daughters contemptuously submits to him, and only after biting her and drinking her blood does the horrified Dracula realize that the girl's wirgin blood is NOT in fact wirgin blood! Dracula is forced to vomit the blood into the bathtub, heaving and gurgling as he indiscriminately curses the rodent-like Anton.Enter the hero: a decidedly non-Van Helsing-like stable boy---a slouching, foul-mouthed, malingering lowlife who balances his time between assaulting the farmer's daughters and spewing pseudo-Communistic rhetoric. Operation: 'Wirgin Blood' is now compromised! Anton self-servingly betrays Dracula in an effort to save himself, and is killed. Ultimately Dracula fails in his quest and is attacked by the stable boy, the latter being armed with an old-fashioned wood axe. The stable boy begins chopping Dracula apart, limb by limb, while the Dracula runs like the wind, a hobbled armless creature with his evil cape streaming behind him. In the end, the stable boy whittles Dracula down to a head and torso.Defiantly, the defeated Dracula enigmatically exclaims: "You fool, you can't kill me! I'm not one of you!" Form your own conclusion.Short of the epic thriller Expose, aka The House on Straw Hill, this is probably the most enjoyable of the Udo Movies. Look for the upcoming sequel, Operation: Wirgin Blood vs. Plan 9 From Outer Space. </p>

 <p> 4 stars = Classic"Blood for Dracula," aka..."Andy Warhol's Dracula, (1974), is a Dracula movie unlike any else.I saw this film the first time about twenty years ago. I had read a lot about it, mostly good to great things. So I was very excited to see the film! I watched it, then marked it off until now. I was expecting a straight Dracula film, with a strong Dracula, orchestrating all the events that happen around him. Evil personified, that's Dracula, right? I mean, he's "the Prince of Darkness," right? Well, all I 'm going to say is, not in this film."Blood for Dracula" is a black comedy, played totally straight without a wink at the audience once, well, maybe it does wink a few times, (;=). It totally flew over my head twenty years ago, because this was not what I was hoping for. All it's dark humor lost on me, but not now! Yes, this is a art house film, but it is also accessible to those who will expect something that it is not a straight horror film, or anywhere near. For those that want Count Dracula to be "the Prince of Darkness," I suggest you go looking somewhere else, because you won't find it here. What you will find is one of the most peculiar Dracula movies ever made, an anti Dracula movie, filled with all sorts of sexual goodies that it was also noted for, which it does provide in ample amounts. It is a film played straight, for an audience who can appreciate black comedy that is so subtle, it's overt.Now it's time to go to Italy & find some "Wirgins!" </p>

 <p> When I see a film with "Andy Warhol Presents" near the title, I cringe. For the record, I think that a guy who paints pictures of Campbell soup cans and passes it off as satiric art deserves my scorn. Moreover, I think a society reveals its moral bankruptcy when it elevates an odd duck like Warhol and his acolytes into figures worthy of worship. My personal opinions about Warhol and his "Factory" caused me a good measure of turmoil after I watched Paul Morrissey's "Blood for Dracula." This campy retelling of the Dracula legend is, by all accounts, closely associated with Warhol's forays into various forms of media, so if I despise Warhol I must necessarily despise this picture. I can't make that leap, however, because I discovered much to my liking in this cheesy movie. Discovering that Criterion actually released this on DVD might well be the biggest shock of them all; anyone familiar with the home video market recognizes Criterion's reputation for releasing some of the finest films ever made. Oh, how I dislike these dilemmas!"Blood for Dracula" opens with a pathetic Count Dracula lumbering through his musty castle in Romania. It's the early twentieth century, and Drac finally realizes that the good old days are long gone. Once upon a time, a hard working vampire with charm and a little money could easily woo plenty of young virgins and sup on their blood at leisure. Now with those pesky modern ideas, a gal just doesn't keep herself pure until marriage anymore. This causes the Count a lot of trouble, especially since he suffers violent spasms whenever he imbibes the blood of a deflowered youngster. This poor guy's starving to death until his personal servant Anton proposes a brilliant idea: why not move to Italy? Virgins abound in that sunny clime, assures the valet, because with the Catholic Church's influence in the region all of the girls assume a dignity sorely lacking in the bleak atmospheres of the East. With nothing to lose, the good Count agrees to leave his castle and head to Italy. Like most tourists, he's just looking for a good meal. The fact that the Count's car sports a wheelchair and coffin strapped to the roof doesn't faze these two travelers in the least. All one need say is that the coffin holds a loved one headed for burial in Italy.Once Count Dracula and his assistant reach Italy, they quickly fall in with a decaying noble family with four lovely daughters. Now all the Count must do is find out which one is the virgin and his health will improve in direct proportion to the amount of blood he drains from her neck. The only problem with this plot concerns the nature of this family. None of the marriageable daughters possess virginal attributes. In fact, these young ladies are complete degenerates who spend most of their waking moments down at the handyman's cottage or in each other's arms. To further complicate matters, the handyman subscribes heart and soul to the doctrines of communism, and he definitely does not like the Count's aristocratic manners or the idea of one of his young conquests married off to this Romanian intruder. This young communist soon discovers the Count's secret and dispatches the vampire in a sufficiently gruesome manner."Blood for Dracula" assembles the necessities for a campy film: atrocious acting, cheesy gore, and laughable dialogue. Simultaneously, the movie contains lavish set pieces, good costumes, lots of nudity, and several nifty twists on the Dracula legend. Morrissey's film also throws in a charming musical score by Claudio Gizzi that seems out of place in such a trashy film. You would think this movie is high art after listening to the quaint sounds of piano washing over the menu screen, and you would be wrong. This production attains a high cheese content from the opening sequence to the closing credits. That doesn't mean the film dives for the gutter all of the time: the plot adroitly deals with European class issues through the characters of the Count and Mario, the commie handyman. Many of the erotic sequences include dialogue about the rich versus the poor, and the handyman's sexual power over the wealthy daughters hints at the triumph of the working class over the decadent rich.The acting steals the show in "Blood for Dracula." I've watched thousands of films throughout my thirty odd years of existence, and I've rarely seen overacting reach these heights. Everyone's guilty here, but Udo Kier as Dracula, Joe Dallesandro as the handyman Mario, and Arno Juerging as Dracula's servant Anton are the most egregious offenders. Dallesandro gives a new meaning to the term "wooden," with facial expressions carved from granite and dialogue delivered in a Brooklyn accent totally out of place on an Italian estate. Udo Kier screams his lines in a German accent so over the top that my ribs hurt from the concussive blasts of laughter rocketing out of my mouth whenever he appeared on screen. Arno Juerging takes his accent one step further, if that's possible, with every utterance simmering with implied threat. Why are Dracula and Anton so angry all the time? Who knows, but it's hilarious to watch. Overkill is the name of the game in this film.I chortled and guffawed through every scene in this movie. I went in expecting to hate "Blood for Dracula" and emerged with an excellent opinion of the proceedings. If you enjoy cheese as much as I do, you must pop this classic in the DVD player soon. Criterion throws in a commentary with Kier and Morrissey, a stills gallery set to the beautiful musical score, and a great transfer of the movie to conclude the package. I can't recommend it enough. </p>

 <p> Thursday, January 20, 2005 / 3 of 5 / Udo Dracula, hmm.I was obliquely aware of this title while I was collecting the various Hammer Dracula's recently.  Not knowing too much of the back story with Andy Warhol's involvement, but mildly curious to see how Udo Kier would look as Dracula I decided to give it a try.  Udo's Dracula is a vain fop in a supremely weakened state.  He has to head to Italy in search of `weergins' to sate his hunger, having dispensed with most of the locals and seeing modern times' sexual mores deplete the supply.  With the help of his faithful assistant who I found probably the most amusing part of the story they arrive at an Italian estate in disrepair and he courts the four daughters of the house with varying degrees of success; due to the Marxist hunky worker already going through them.  One often hears the term `camp' associated with this film and its companion piece.  I suppose there were a few smirks solicited from it, but it hit me as somewhat average.  We'll see how Flesh for Frankenstein goes next. </p>

 <p> Blood for Dracula is an interesting take on the Dracula legend. Dracula is in this film, a weak, sickly, even depressed vampire. who seems to detest everything in life except for his faithful assistant. They travel to early twentieth century Italy from Romania, in search of "Wergins", so Dracula can feed. They settle in an aristrocratic mansion, where the Lord of the Manor has three sexy daughters, and a 14 year old girl as well. Also, a "fieldhand", who enjoys getting it on with the daughters. This character is misplaced in the film, and his contemporary Brooklyn accent, along with his poor acting skills dont help the film. There is also a disturbing scene where he rapes the 14 year old, in order to deny Dracula her virgin blood. Other than that, the film is a hit. It is high on erotisism, and the two better looking daughters spend much of the film naked, and all over each other or the fieldhand. The neck biting scenes are some of the finest on film, but poor Dracula, he cannot live on tainted blood! All in all, a good film, funny, bloody, and a little sad even. </p>

 <p> Co-directors Paul Morrissey and Antonio Margheriti started filming "Blood for Dracula" the day after they completed filming on "Flesh for Frankenstein", both "experimental" ventures for which Andy Warhol served in a vague capacity as producer in 1973. "Blood for Dracula" was shot in 3 weeks for $300,000 and borrowed 3 of its stars from the Frankenstein film: Udo Kier plays Count Dracula, Arno Juerging is his valet Anton, and Joe Dallesandro is their proletarian nemesis Mario. In this raunchy comedic take on vampirism, Count Dracula is withering away and will soon die if he isn't nourished with the blood of a virgin. Anton advises the reluctant Count to leave his ancestral home and venture abroad, to Italy, where Catholicism has surely preserved the maidenhood of many young women. The pair are elated to find just what they seek in the di Fiori family, an impoverished aristocratic clan with 4 daughters who can restore the family's fortune by marrying well. But the ladies are not as pure as Dracula had hoped. And the estate's intractable Marxist handyman, Mario, resents the Count's patrician presumption.Paul Morrissey believed that a film could be interesting if the characters are, and "Blood for Dracula" might prove him right. This is an art house film from a more sybaritic era, full of hunky men and immodest women. It's frequently and deliberately in bad taste. But "Blood for Dracula" is a sharp commentary on class, family and sexual mores. The characters are campy, but committed performances make them surprisingly strong. Maxime McKendry and Stephania Casini are particularly effective as the class-conscious Marchesa di Fiori and as Rubinia, the cheekiest and raciest of the daughters, respectively. Arno Juerging propels the plot forward. Udo Kier's Dracula is alternately repulsive and sympathetic. In this case, experimental doesn't imply incompetence. Gianni Giovagnoni's art direction and Luigi Kuveiller's low-budget cinematography are surprisingly good. Paul Morrissey concluded that he had made "some sort of vampire film". I don't know exactly what "Blood for Dracula" is either, but it is certainly interesting.The DVD: Bonus features include a "Stills Gallery" of on-set and publicity photos  and an audio commentary by director Paul Morrissey, actor Udo Kier, and film historian Maurice Yacowar. The commentary was recorded for the laserdisc in 1996, and the three commentaries were taped separately, then combined  on one track. It's a little awkward, but still a very interesting commentary. </p>

 <p> When I saw Warhols Frankenstein in the origianl 3-D (Still have the glasses) at the age of 15, snuck in. I was blown away. And now Blood For Dracula. This one is great too but in a suttle way. I was struck at how such an inexpensive film($340,000)could look and sound so good. The first thing I noticed was the great musical score, just loved it. And of course the photography was rich and handsome too. I knew this was a super cheesey film and boy was it great. If you know what you are getting into for 100 or so minutes then you will be delighted. But it is the accents that rule in this movie. Man I love this film. As a companion piece to Frankenstein it is grand. Great gore, soft core sex scenes and lots of butchered english dialogue make this one a keeper. </p>

 <p> Apart from the above average - though far from original -cinematography, this is a terrible film.  The acting is quite awful with the worst accents ever put on film.  The dialog is sophmoric and the plot dubious, even for  the horror genre.  Heavy with pretension and, except for one scene, lacking  in wit, it fails as camp; lacking true insight and dedication to craft, it  fails as art.  The liner notes imply some of this was intentional, I find  that assertion worthy of the greatest scepticism. </p>

 <p> Some people may ask about the title of this review, and all I have to say is, watch the movie.  Everything campy and cheesy is present here, including completely hammed up accents.  While "Flesh For Frankenstien" felt more like a horror movie, this film comes off as something of a soft core porn romp with a character who only slightly resembles Dracula.  Instead of the pure Mina we are given incestuos bi-sexual sisters.  Instead of a noble Dracula, you get a whinny, sickly Dracula.  And instead of the usual dashing hero you get a rapist with a thick Brooklyn accent.  And on the subject of our hero.  I have never wanted to kill the hero in any movie more than this guy.  The actor, who appears to be a pet of Warhol's, does a decent job (he actually was much better in Flesh for Frankenstein) but is character is disgusting.  He forces himself on at least three girls in the whole movie (numours times, as well as one being a 14 year old).If it wasn't for the hero of the story I would have given this movie four stars, but as it is, well, it falls flat and to be honest, at times becomes nothing but a cheap 70's porn flick.  I would suggest Flesh For Frankenstien over this one any day. </p>

 <p> This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD version of the Film.This film, another by Paul Morrissey and Andy Warhol is less disturbing than their previous release, &quot;Flesh for Frankenstein.&quot;This film is also a loose adaptation of the book.Set in the 1920's or 30's Dracula is dying. To survive he must drink the blood of a virgin. He has become too notorious in Romania to approach any women and there are few virgins there. So he and his caregiver drive to Italy as they believe that there are more virgins there. He stays with a family that has 4 daughters, when asking some them if they are virgins, they lie and he becomes very sick from drinking their blood.The film has excellent music which deserves to be in a better film. The Criterion collection special features are sudio commentary by cast and crew. There is also an 11 minute slideshow of production and publicity photos backed with selections from the musical score. </p>

 <p> Andy Warhol produced this film. It stars Joe Dallesandro and Udo Kier, as Dracula ("Blade," "Private Idaho" and "Flesh for Frankenstein). It has been restored to a pristine print. It was originally filmed in 3-D and you will see things coming towards the front of the screen. In the theatres they looked like they were coming into the audience. Made to be scary and gory, it is often true camp and a film all movie goers should enjoy. </p>

 <p> Count Dracula is a powerful, diabolical fiend whose inhuman craving for blood has frightened movie goers for years. &quot;Blood for Dracula&quot; presents a different type of Dracula. Udo Keir plays the count as a sickly, weak wimp whose craving for the blood of a virgin is like an alcoholic's craving for a highball. He must have blood of a virgin or he gets violently ill. There is a great scene where the count drinks the blood of an unchaste girl and he gets violently ill, spewing blood while rolling around on the floor of a beautiful marble bathroom. The acting in this movie is atrocious but it is hardly a complaint as it is so bad that it gives the movie a campy humor. There is plenty of gore to satisfy the gore hounds and naked flesh and sex to titilate the libido. Criterion has done their usual excellent job with the widescreen presentation of this film. </p>

 <p> This movie stinks. The Criterion case talks about it being an &quot;outrageous cult classic&quot; and I've enjoyed nearly all of the movies they're brought to DVD, but this movie isn't good on any level. The acting is horrible and the plot isn't even up to porno standards. It does have gratuitous sex scenes (which are explicit enough to give this movie an &quot;X&quot; rating), but the women aren't attractive (my wife thought the guy was ok - good abs) and the sex is uninspiring unless you're a virgin.  Horror fans will be disappointed because there is none (unless bad acting scares you), and Dracula fans will be disappointed because the entire study of the mythos consists of him needing to drink virgin blood and he doesn't have a reflection in a mirror. Of course, he has no problem picking up a crucifix, walking in sunlight, and is only slightly put out upon entering a chapel.  Perhaps the worst part is that this movie doesn't even click as one of those horrible movies that suck you in because you're amazed at how bad they are. I bought this movie because of the reviews below - don't make the same mistake - rent it first. Or better yet - get Rocky Horror if you want to watch a cult classic....  If you want horror, get Scream, Psycho, etc. If you want Vampires, watch Interview With the Vampire. </p>
