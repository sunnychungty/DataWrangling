 <p> Finally this book has arrived! I was a little miffed that I had to wait a couple of months to read the final book of Farren and Mick.The events in this book were not what I had expected which made it more entertaining and eventful than the others. I chose a four star rating because I thought it could have been a longer book considering the wait for it. I recommend it to those who like a quick read and little detailed sex exploits. I have to say I am excited to read about Kiki and Chet who possess the Dom and Sub type of relationship. Could be very interesting! </p>

 <p> A great wrap up to the story for Mick & Faren. All of our questions are finally answered and our two lovebirds get the ending they deserve (although they have to work for it)I'm glad to learn that the story won't stop there but continue on with Thorn & Kiki also getting a book! </p>

 <p> The Token 6 comes with mind blowing revelations and exciting new twists just has the HEA we've been hoping for is finally within reach.Faren is reeling from the shocking discoveries revealed in the The Token 5. She has something to live for and nothing is going to get in her way of happiness. Kiki, her ever faithful friend, gives her the backing and humor she needs as well as superior skills with self defence using a dolly. When threats emerge, will Faren be able to still keep that happiness she yearns for or will she loose it all?This is one of the hardest reviews I had to write trying not to give away any spoilers. So much has happened in Faren's journey, her life has been a battle to survive. Now, her every choice could make or break her Happily Ever After.I loved The Token 6. Once again, Eros takes us down a path we never imagined and shocks us to our cores. She gives us the closure we need for Mick's and Faren's story but then gives us a glimpse of a new story to come that, if you can believe it, might even be hotter than Mick's and Faren's affair.Marata Eros is a queen of dark romance! Suspense filled, action packed, erotic driven romances that stick in your imagination long after they are through. </p>

 <p> My Rant:  OMG, My mouth is open and probably catching flies because this story has changed its coarse on me. I was not prepared for the twist of events. In the last installment Faren and McKenna are still in the process of working through their issues. I rushed to dive into this story because I wanted so bad to see Faren and Mckenna makeup but what you get in this story is completely priceless. Everything that you have encounter in the previous books were shadowed with lies to protect the truth and when the truth hits the severity of it blows you mind. The Token continues to have a kick A$$ plot but there is an increased intensity to the story. The action and suspenses kneads at you and you begin to drift so far into the story your two deep to crawl yourself out. As always McKenna just gives you that heart fluttering romance vibe but Thorn really surprised me. Thorn is un adulterated raw. You love and hate him at the same time but in this segment of the series I completely love him and when the really thorn is revealed the raunchy tough demeanor make perfect sense. Faren is still fragile but strong. She pulls the focus of this story by her determination, love and the ability to survive through the madness of her life, while her side kick KiKi bring flare to the center stage. I admire both characters will to perceiver in light of the struggles they have in this plot. You get to see their friendship grow to bounds unknown and you fall right in the middle of their new found sister-ship. There are new characters introduced that make a entrance that is unforgettable. Chet already has me eating out of his palms because you cant resist the charm he eludes. The Token #6 rocks period. Marata writing is captivating and addictive. She is raw, edgy and full of sass. This series is smoking hot and full of action and The Token #6  will excite you emotionally, challenge you mentally and leave you craving for the next installment. Marata gave us a taste of thorn and let me tell you my mouth has gone dry because I need more.My Recommendation:Overall I love this book and the Token Series. I rated this book 5 out of 5 Purple Rant Hearts and would recommend this book to anyone that loves a romance that is an emotional roller-coaster that is full of action. This book has all the elements of a great story with a edgy twist. . I will be adding the Token 6 to my favorites list.FTC Disclosure: I received this book for free from the author, editor, publisher, or Promo Host. This is my honest opinion about this book and I did not receive any monetary compensation for writing this review nor was I obligated to write a positive one. </p>

 <p> Is happiness for Faren and Mick finally within reach? Faren has been given a second lease on life. Should she even tell Mick, who seems to have moved on, leaving Faren and their baby behind? After everything that has happened, there is still danger lurking in the darkness, just waiting to pounce. Has Faren got one more fight in her or will this be the straw that breaks the proverbial camel&#8217;s back? Will her decisions give her the joy she deserves?Yet again, Marata Eros explodes onto each page with her own brand of dark and edgy twists, attitude and humor, while digging deep to make the final part of Faren and Mick&#8217;s story one of her best yet! She has given the a sporadic spotlight to Kiki and Thorn, revealing truths will sucker punch you into seeing so many characters in a different light. Ms. Eros has turned anti-heroes into heroes and heroines into pillars of strength, but never once does she break stride or lose focus on THE ACTION or THE ROMANCE. She heats up every page with her words as she brings her stories to life and her characters into your heart.How does she keep raising her creative bar and then topping it time after time? </p>

 <p> The Ultimate Ending written by Marata Eros answering some of the Ultimate questions ever asked, dreamt of and others never even imagined, The Token 6 is outstanding in the way it closes the turbulent chapter on what has been Faren Mitchel&#8217;s story.Just like others I waited for The Token 6 with baited breath, dying to find out the truth behind all of the carefully intertwined plot themes but at the same time not wanting for what has been a truly amazing story to finally come to a close. Mystery and intrigue have just a small part to play in the unfolding of the whole story that will see everything become resolved but not before coming around full circle, bring out players you didn&#8217;t even realise were there and a few that were but just who were not who you thought they were &#8211; the time for taking off those masks has begun.Faren no longer has to fear imminent death, her original diagnosis a mix-up, she is now free to plan a life with her child, but what role will Mick play ultimately play in that new found lifetime? After finding Mick with another woman in his office when she had gone to straighten things out in The Token 5, leading to her heart being broken yet again, Faren forges on with her plan to be a single mother. But with Tagger and Jay Hightower both still unresolved problems just who can she turn to?But no one knows just what Mick&#8217;s reaction will be when he learns that Faren is not terminal, that she is very much alive and going to be in his life for much longer than he anticipated? Knowing Mick as we do so far &#8211; his reaction is bound to get everyone talking. Thorn still hangs on the hook but both Faren and Mick work together in order to keep him from going down for something he didn&#8217;t do, even then more surprises, lies and &#8220;OMG did that just happen?&#8221; Moments will still occur!Danger still lurks around the corners for everyone concerned&#8211; but just who is playing who in the game where everyone has everything to lose and everything to gain for a lifetime?The Token 6 is Nothing like any of the previous Token novels in the fact that everything you think you know &#8211; you don&#8217;t!! An amazing Finale, I look forward to reading what Marata Eros has done with Thorn (The Token 7) </p>

 <p> A nice way to wrap up Mick and Faren's story with romance, danger, suspense, and an unforeseen plot twist.  I hated when we found out about Faren's health in the last part because it was so predictable but I am so glad Marata Eros made up for it with the surprise identity of one of the bad guys.  Carmen and Kimi should be a psychological mess after everything they have been through but they are such incredibly strong characters that nothing seems able to keep them down.  The men in this series are not very likable, but by the end I found it easier to appreciate their love and protective measures they go through to protect.  I recommend this series to anyone that love a mixture of erotica, suspense, action, and drama.  You get a sample of all types of romance.  Happy reading my fellow bookworms! </p>

 <p> Although there is more to the series this is the final book for Mick and Faren. Not as great as the rest of the series since it is slightly predictable but still a good book.We find out who killed Mick's sister, the final conclusion to the Jay situation and what ultimately happens with Mick and Faren's relationship. I think the storyline was slightly rushed in regards to the evil surrounding Faren but as far as her relationship it was well told.We also get more insight into Ty who is the book in the series. There is a chapter at the end of this book previewing his past and boy does it sound interesting. </p>

 <p> I was given this as a gift from the author in exchange for an honest review! Who's a lucky girl?!Talk about twists & turns!! I thought I knew where Faren & Mick's story was heading but I should have known that ME doesn't roll straight down the line. What a thoroughly satisfying, yet twisted conclusion to this wonderful story!I'm not going to give you a summary, because a) I find them so difficult to write (read the synopsis!) and b) I can't do it without giving juicy stuff away! So here is what I have to say....What we, the fans, get from the Token 6 is, in true Marata style, so much more than we bargained for! We find out who the bad guys is!!! (A fist pump worthy moment!). We get action, drama, romance, suspense, surprise, giggles and a whole heap of satisfaction and delight. You have no idea how ingenious the plot is, I never saw the identity of the villain coming! Ms. Eros' depth of deceit knows no bounds! I love it!I'm especially looking forward to the next two upcoming installments which focus on the intriguing Thorn and the hilarious and snarky Kiki!The Token series, so far, has been one hell of a roller coaster ride of emotions for me, and super addictive. Do yourself a favour and start from the beginning and enjoy the ride. You won't be able to put it down. </p>

 <p> There are 9 parts to The Token series.  I recommend these novellas be read in order:Part 1: The Token 1 - Mick & FarenPart 2: The Token 2 - Mick & FarenPart 3: The Token 3 - Mick & FarenPart 4: The Token 4 - Mick & FarenPart 5: The Token 5 - Mick & FarenPart 6: The Token 6 - Mick & FarenPart 7: The Token 7 - ThornPart 8: The Token 8 - KikiPart 9: The Token 9 - ChetIn The Token, part 1-5 we followed physical therapist, Faren Mitchell when she after being diagnosed with a brain tumor was hit by a Harley Davidson driven by billionaire Jared &#8220;Mick&#8221; McKenna.  For reasons that will unfold, Faren decided to keep secret both her illness and her working graveyard at one of his strip clubs to pay for her mom&#8217;s medical care.  Their budding romance was constantly overshadowed by traumatic pasts, shocking revelations, menacing villains, lies, deceit, secrets, crimes and corruption.The Token, part 6 is the final installment in Mick and Faren&#8217;s saga.  We have learned about their painful past as they got to know each while looking for villains.  We have followed them in ups and down trying to piece it all together, but as some questions were answered, new arose.  The time has come for the conclusion; some shocking last developments before the truth comes out, crimes are solved and the final villains revealed.JARED ULYSSES MCKENNA, &#8220;MICK&#8221;: ~30 years/Billionaire/Mogul/Owner of Gentleman&#8217;s clubs/$$$$/Dark auburn hair/dark brown eyes/tattoo.Jared &#8220;Mick&#8221; McKenna has remained a bit of an enigma throughout.  Seven words to describe Jared: Enigmatic, mysterious, possessive, caring, jaded, elusive and determined.FAREN MITCHELL: 22 years/physical therapist, part-time exotic dancer/caramel blond hair/light gray eyes/5&#8217;9&#8221;/ex-ballerina/virgin.Faren Mitchell has had my heart from the beginning!  Maybe it&#8217;s the combination of her brain tumor diagnosis, slightly deformed hand, innocence, her secrets and past trauma.  Seven words to describe Faren: Lonely, reflective, loyal, broken, innocent, strong and nave.The Token, part 6 has the perfect ending to a long, suspenseful, painful yet hopeful journey.  The rest of serial will follow their friends, starting with part 7- Thorn.Captivating and suspenseful plot!  Eclectic and poignant story-telling. Compelling heroine!  Mysterious  and enigmatic hero!***Hero rating: 5 starsHeroine rating: 5 starsSexual tension rating: 5 starsSex scenes rating: 4.5 starsSex scenes frequency: 3.5 starsPlot rating: 5 starsDialogue rating: 5 starsStorytelling rating: 5 starsStory ending rating: 5 starsBook editing rating (5 = no edits spotted): 5 stars************************************************Overall rating: 5 starsWould I recommend this series: Yes.Would I re-read this series: Yes.Would I read future books by this author: Yes.A gifted copy was provided to me by author/publisher in exchange for an honest review. </p>

 <p> It goes without say that I do Love Marata Eros books, she is the best and the Token books were the bomb. I just don't know who decided to keep making me buy a book on the same story over and over again, this was a big turn off for me, it would have been different if it had been and end that the next book would be a new but I turned a page and boom had to buy a book...........I am not knocking Marata Eros by any means she is the best but some of us are on budgets this was a very expensive read for me. I still have to give 5 stars because that is how good the books are. </p>
