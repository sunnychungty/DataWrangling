 <p> 5 StarAn exciting adventure into a new world.  Justin did an excellent job with this one.  Great character interaction and an exciting plot will keep you wanting to know what happens next.  You wont be disappointed in this book.  A little something for everyone - romance, paranormal, adventure, mystery.  I hope Justin writes more of this type of book, I was hooked from the moment I started reading. </p>

 <p> I usually don't like reading books on my phone, but Justin Osborne's EPIC: Legacy, hit all the right notes and was easy to read (It doesn't hurt that the text is big and well-suited for my Android phone). The story concerns a very scary prospect-What if men started just disappearing into thin air? What transpires is a grand epic starring a likeable protagonist named Deacon who has the kind of spunk and kindess you find in the best kinds of heroes. And he needs it for the adventure he goes on once he enters the Faerie world, Avalon, which is impressive in its scope and character. If I have one complaint, and it's a very small one, it's that the quotation marks are a little off early on, making it kind of jarring for awhile. But story-wise, character-wise, and pacing-wise, you really can't beat EPIC: Legacy. I'm going to pick up the next one to see Deacon's next adventure. </p>

 <p> I loved this first book in the series Epic-legacy-by Justin Osborne -yes it did have some spelling errors but the story was so good ; it didnt bother me too much. As a fantasy it had alittle of everything humor ;those oh crap moments and someones first crush . I liked the main character Daniel I really wanted to see him make it through his battle/quest; turning him from an average high school graduate into a hero, warrior ,a strong man.This book was enjoyable and hard to put down. Great escape it was  nice to see a guy that stands up to the bullys and trys to do the right thing!! </p>

 <p> When I first started reading this book, I was unsure of if I would be able to finish reading it.  The blurb piqued my interest from the start, so I was excited when I started.  However, the first few chapters had me wondering if maybe my blurb-radar was off.  However, I will always try to finish what I start and in the case of this book, it ended up paying off.In the beginning of this book, there was a lot of information throw at you at once.  It took me a couple times reading through what was being said just too fully understand what was going on.  Another issue that I had with it was there were certain characters that spoke in a certain dialect.  While Justin did an amazing job writing in that dialect, it was also hard for me to follow at times.Once the book really gets going, there is still a lot of information that is displayed, but it is done in a way that it's easier to follow.  You only have to understand one thing at a time, as opposed to several things.  The world's that Justin was able to create, and the different creatures as well, were done in a way that you couldn't wait to find out more.With the way the book ended, it certainly opened up the pathway to a second book in the series.  There were many parts of this book that could do with more explaining, but I am hoping that the next book will be able to answer any questions that are left behind from reading this one. </p>

 <p> People are disappearing; more specifically men between the ages of 15 and 55.  They aren't just wandering away or getting lost, kidnapped or murdered.  Their entire bodies are disappearing into a whiff of smoke, leaving only their clothes behind.  No one knows where they are going or if they are coming back.  But 17 year old Deacon McTaggart's mom has decided that she isn't going to take any chances with him disappearing.  She has decided to send him to his uncle Evon's home in Scotland.  Evon has promised that he can keep Deacon safe and keep him from disappearing.  Deacon heads to Scotland and is completely surprised and overwhelmed by what he finds there.  His Uncle Evon has told him that the people are disappearing from Earth and he believes that they are going to the "other" world called Avalon, where Evon and Deacon are from.  Evon tells Deacon some stories of Avalon and the creatures & people that live there.  Deacon doesn't know whether to believe him or not, but when he finds himself accidentally in Avalon, all alone, he starts believing that maybe the stories his uncle was telling weren't induced by the strange brew called Meadale that his uncle had been drinking.I absolutely loved this book!  I really enjoyed the story and learning about this other world called Avalon.  The story is completely different than any other stories that I have read and has some amazing ideas in it.  I loved all of the characters.  There are fairies, dragons, giants, trolls (Trulls), vampires, you name it!  The storytelling was very vivid and it grabbed me and wouldn't let go.  I read it in one day and then turned to the 2nd book because of course, it is a cliffhanger.There were only a few problems that I had with this book and I think they could be blamed on the formatting for the Kindle.  There were punctuation issues that would be hard to believe that were done on purpose.  For instance, instead of using an apostrophe in a contraction, an quote mark was used instead:  can"t instead of can't.  Also, there were weird things happening with the quotes.  I don't think I can demonstrate how it looked on here because I have no idea how to even make it happen.  I will just describe it as this:  for the beginning quote mark, a "lower" quotation mark was used (like a double comma in front of the word) and the end quote was a normal end quote mark.  Huh??  How do you do that?  Anyway, no other issues with the book with the exception of some very minor grammatical things.I highly recommend this book to any young adult, adult, fiction, fantasy, dystopian (or whatever you want to call it) reader.  There are a few minor curse words, no sex, some violence, but nothing grotesque or homicidal.  I was explaining the book to my husband and my 7 year old and they both thought it sounded good.  Justin Osborne is a great storyteller and definitely has an overactive imagination!  I cannot even begin to fathom how he came up with this idea or any of the ideas/names, etc in this story.  I cannot wait until Book 3 comes out!! </p>

 <p> Justin Osborne's EPIC: Legacy is a funny and fresh tale. His take on Avalon is different making this journey thoroughly enjoyable and quite refreshing. Told through the eyes of a young man forged into a the role of a Hero.. Meet Deacon, an amusing and witty musician, who tends to use his fists to keep the bully's in line. Thrown head first into a new world, Deacon must use his brains and not just brawn as he falls into this Legacy and makes it his own. </p>

 <p> Epic: Legacy is the first book in this series and it lived up to its name to say the least. A flaming puppy with spunk, a bashful beautiful giant, and the troubled teen from earth that grows into a hero, these characters make this story worth reading. A caste of side characters that make this well rounded and worth your eyes reading over more than once. I should know.Different, interesting, captivating, beautiful, funny and adventurous are just some of the words to sum this book up simply. A story that won't soon be forgot. Deacon is a young man that is going through it all, and you will want to read to find out what it is that he faces and how he deals with it. Light hearted comedy and thrilling to read. My only drawbacks were it read like a young adult novel but the language sort of stomped on my recommending it to anyone under 17. (I'm a harsh parent I know.)However if you scroll over that this book has it all. From: all interesting names, to a finely described world, people and creatures. Once you read all the way to the end, you will realize why it is actually gratifying to find that there is a book two. Cliffhangers can be a pain, but you realize that this story is well worth it being two parts. So what are you waiting for? For the price this is everything that you have been searching for. Climb aboard and take a ride with these lovable and memorable characters as they take this incredible and wonderful journey of Epic proportions! </p>

 <p> EPIC: Legacy is the first book in Author Justin Osborne's EPIC series, and begins the journey of protagonist Deacon McTaggart.The world is facing a crisis. The men are disappearing with no explanation to be given and the population is dwindling rapidly. Already a few billion have gone. Everyone is scared, as they should be. Deacon's mother is given word by his uncle that they need to join him in Scotland to stay safe from what may come of this catastrophe. When Deacon arrives he discovers that his uncle knows a lot more about this issue than anybody else.Evon McTaggart, Deacon's uncle, is a hero from another world called Avalon. Dragons and faeries and magic are things of common in Avalon, the rules there different from on Earth. Evon reveals that a strange new creature called Ubaru'ud is behind the strange disappearances, as he is for the inevitable destruction of Avalon. It's Evon's duty to save as many from the destruction as possible, but due to circumstances, he is unable to do so.Deacon, in disbelief of all this new information, wanders off and runs head first into a faerie, the only creature that can lead people between the two worlds. She's been missing, thus why Evon could not save anyone from Avalon. Deacon, through an accident, ends up falling through the portal with the faerie and injures her, trapping him in the doomed world.Time is running out, and he has to hurry if he wants to get home and save the people of Avalon from their fate.Full of fantasy and magic, EPIC: Legacy is an enthralling read. Deacon is a very relatable character, stumbling a bit through this new world before catching himself and trying his best to adjust. I personally like him for his affinity for good music.The only reason at all that I give this book a four star rating other than a solid five is due to a few editing errors I could not help but notice. Overlooking this though, this book was brilliant and well done.I seriously recommend it to all fantasy lovers! </p>

 <p> Osborne is very detailed with his writing and as expected I was not disappointed! Everything played out like a movie in my head. Deacon has wit, compassion, and cynicism. Ardron, the villain has arrogance. Both amazing well written characters. The story was also very unique. Osborne takes what was real and interwove it with fantasy. If you haven't read this yet you should! You will not be disappointed unless, you're one of those uptight stick in the mud. </p>

 <p> Something is happening around the world and cannot be explained.  Men are just up and disappearing; not just walking away but actually disappearing from the face of the earth.  It seems most men between the ages of 15 and 55 are drastically disappearing.Janyce McTaggart was very worried about her son Deacon; he had just graduated from High School and was very afraid he could be next!  So she made plans to send Deacon to Scotland to live with his Uncle, Evon McTaggart and his mother was to follow in two weeks.When Deacon arrives in Scotland he is met at the airport by a strange man named Fennon; Deacon was under the impression he worked for his Uncle.  He drove Deacon to his Uncles property and when they got to the front door Fennon performed some kind of magic on the door in order for it to open.  This was the beginning of a very exciting and strange adventure for Deacon!Can't tell you anymore for fear of exposing too much; you need to read this book and see what happens to Deacon and his family!I really enjoyed this book!  Lots of strange animals and people and even fairies!  The characters are all well developed and I feel going into book two that I won't have any trouble knowing who they all are!  I certainly enjoyed this book and have already started book two! </p>
