 <p> This DVD is a pure waste. It teaches nothing and does nothing. A complete waste of money. Nothing informative or helpful in anyway. There is much better out there. NEW SEX for one. Just Skip this one. </p>

 <p> Female Masturbation Vol. II, Every Woman's Orgasm is Unique, is the classiest masturbation video I have ever seen. The tone set was warm and relaxing. The background music was inviting. The woman masturbating is a beautiful, libidinous woman. The viewer is given a rare opportunity to share in this woman's orgasm. It is obvious that she has trained her clitoris and entire body to feel more sensation. This is evident even before she touches her clitoris. As she reviewed the specific parts of her genitalia for the viewer, I could see and feel her excitement already building. There were contractions even before she touched her clitoris and her inner labia had started to engorge and unfold.I felt my own body relax with hers. With each stroke, I was taken in by the colorful changes that were occurring in her genitals. Her once closed inner labia had blossomed and thinned revealing her urethral sponge. This all takes place within the first 5 minutes. What more could happen? Well, there is no doubt in my mind that this woman was deliberately producing orgasm in her body. Her moans intensify, her face becomes flush and her outer labia continue to engorge. This is masturbation at its finest. A specific frame I enjoyed was towards the end. She took her finger off her clit and I could see where she had been stroking. That spot was a darker crimson color compared to the rest of her clit.I watched this DVD alone the first time. Immediately following I jumped into my bed and researched the various strokes she had used on her clit.  Several days later I watched this DVD with my husband. He was very interested in the changes of the woman's genitalia, often commenting on the change of color or engorgement. It was such a turn on for both of us to watch this together.This video is not for everyone. Those not interested in the limitless potential of female orgasm need not apply. As it states on the back of the cover, the people who produce this video are sensuality and sexuality educators. I feel that this DVD demonstrates the years of research and experience that they have obviously enjoyed. I do wonder, there is a point when she looks up and smiles. I would love to know whom she was smiling at... </p>

 <p> Now, at this point, you may be saying, "But Nicholas, you aren't a woman!" In which case my reply to you would be, "My name is not Nicholas."After I have told you this, I would likely slap you across the cheek for your ignorance, and then proceed to answer your accusation. I would say, "Yes, you are correct. I am not a woman. But I have my sexual needs, too."This book gratified me. It taught me how to...you know...do...stuff...with my, umm, my...you know...how to, uh...do that thing, that people do, like, in X-rated movies...sometimes involving stewed carrots...or in "American Psycho" coat hangers...you know, ... the dirty deed.So, in conclusion, if you have manly female needs, this book will satisfy your sexual urges. I know it did for me.I would lend you my own copy as a loaner usually, but in this particular case the pages are, uh, a bit "sticky," so I'd recommend you purchase your own copy. </p>

 <p> When I first started the female masturbation DVD I felt a level of excitement that lasted throughout the entire video.  From the introduction to the end, I felt relaxed and enthusiastic about the information covered in the film.  It started with a beautiful full-breasted woman prepping her self for a journey of sensual stimulation.  I was very happy to go on that journey with her.  When she started masturbating, I noticed that I have never seen a woman react like that to her own stimulation. Actually, I have never watched a woman masturbate.  It was very nice to see a woman, who knows how to please her self, masturbate and get off so well.  I enjoyed the quick anatomy lesson and the close ups of her flowering genitalia.I feel like seeing this video gives me a good perspective on women and their orgasm.  It is exciting for my self, and it gave me some ideas of how to give my partner better orgasm.  This video gave me the experience to see how different women can have orgasm.  From the music, the cinematography, to the content of this video I thought that this movie was a great learning experience. </p>

 <p> Ummmm, incredible how BORING an orgasm can be! If she ever actually came at all, which I find debatable. She seemed to just prolong the pre-orgasmic state for half an hour and then smile and wipe herself off. And....THAT'S IT! </p>

 <p> It is probably obvious by now that I love these DVDs.In this one, the woman comes out and lays herself on the bed, and prepares for this special time.  She shows one straight-forward technique, showing exactly where to stroke with her fingertips.  "Every woman's orgasm is unique," is the appropriate name for this DVD.It is highly alluring to see all the different phases a woman's body will go through in just 25 minutes or so of arousal.  They emphasize how engorgement happens through relaxing.  This part looks more natural and effortless than I have seen before.No fancy camera work in this one, though the close-up shots are consistent throughout.  Don't mind the basic technology of the filming, because the orgasm shown is real and continuous, one you really can learn something from.These videos are the most informative that I have viewed. They are educative, even for a skilled lover.  Inexperienced individuals would also find them valuable. </p>

 <p> I purchased this DVD along with the Deliberate Orgasm Duet. And that's the way I would recommend to view these.The woman in the Female Masturbation DVD uses the technique of the deliberate orgasm shown in details and explained in the Duet. Without having seen the duet first, I don't know if I would have gotten it or appreciated it. The orgasm she is having is very different from anything I have ever seen, simple, quiet, but I must say works great upon experimenting with it.My partner and I watch the Duet first; it shows a man "doing" a woman, giving her an orgasm by touching her with his hands and explaining how to expand the sensation and making it better and better.Production values are low and do not apply to any of these DVDs but increase in pleasure was a direct result from watching and understanding them. </p>

 <p> I would call this an educational video, more than instructional.  While there is not specific information outlined in any formal way, there is a great deal of information witnessed through a demonstration.After the woman is resting comfortable on the bed, we are shown a brief anatomy lesson and then she immediately begins touching herself, especialy her clitoris.  The technique of Deliberate Orgasm uses overall simple strokes, but with a focused eye anyone can see the subtle variances and feel the change in her orgasm.  The climax slowly builds into a full and longer lasting orgasm, more than I have ever witnessed, and I felt the noticeable effects when I copied the technique on my partner.Surely, there is more to be learned here, but this is definitely a nice introduction into the world of extended orgasm.  Low on the production scale, but crisp, clear, up-close shots of her all natural special parts. </p>

 <p> My partner and I have been exploring avenues to keep our sex life fresh.  I have wanted to be a better lover, and I always thought that this would stem from a technique that I do to him.  After watching these videos, I saw another aspect of being a great lover that I never considered before, which was that I could please him through having my own pleasure.  What a concept!  He and I watched this video together, and I could see how much he enjoyed watching the woman in the movie, doing it to herself, by herself.  I wanted to be that much of a turn-on to him.Because we watched some other videos about the Deliberate Orgasm technique, I wanted to show him how I really touched myself.  After watching the video together, I used the technique and unabashedly showed him what I do.  It was so much fun, and he got very aroused.  After that, he did the technique on my body, and I felt how much he liked pleasing me as much as I like being pleased.What a wonderful addition this has been to the intimacy that we share. </p>

 <p> FM 2A review by JenneSo I settled down one evening and began to view. If like me you have already viewed Volume 1 then you will be familiar with the technique of peaking as they have dubbed it. The good news here is that nothing about this video is dubbed, something that I found refreshing in the sound bite world we live in.The video opens with the message that the clitoris contains more nerve endings than any other part of the body and is followed by the member of the team who will give the demonstration entering a bedroom that I would love -)) An uncluttered one, simple in design but with plenty of pillows. Susan who demonstrates the techniques for us is not naked and simply pulls her slip up to make herself comfortable.Next follows a short biology lesson, if you have no idea which part of the female anatomy is which, and yes I'm talking to the females as well, then this is a definite plus. As the narrator tells us which part is which, Susan points to them. She then takes a small hand mirror and views her genitals, something that many women would benefit from doing.From there on in this video get more interesting as the woman begins to touch herself after applying some lubrication. What I really enjoyed as I watched was the fact that I was privy to something that as a female it is almost impossible for me to view, how a females lips swell and change color as she became more aroused. It was wonderful to see the contractions of the vulva correspond with the sounds that were being made as shebecame more aroused and I should say also extremely erotic.Periodically she would add more lubricant or take a break and examine her genitals in the hand mirror once more.The video ends with a few simple well-chosen phrases and is a perfect closure for this video.What's it all add up to?If you're looking for an action packed adventure film then this is not the one for you. On the other hand, if your interested in a slower paced film where you get to play voyeur to something real that many of us may never experience first hand and are likely to learn something to boot, then you might want to take a look at this.The emphasis is on the woman's enjoyment and the fact that taking your time is important. There are just the right amount of close ups and longer body shots and the fact that this is a simple film with a professional type production only added to my experience as a viewer.I came away from the experience turned on, and wanting to find my own space to experiment with oh and I also now own a small hand mirror. I suddenly became aware that I had rarely watched myself and I learned from this video just how much a female genitals can and do change as they become more aroused.In a world full of man made porn it was great to find a company that focuses on female pleasure and a film that actually doesn't have a script." </p>
