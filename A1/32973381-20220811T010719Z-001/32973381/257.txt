 <p> The premise of this movie was good.  In fact, the first two thirds of the film kept me interested in trying to solve the mystery behind Ian Stone's "reincarnations", so to speak.  Unfortunately, the main villainess reminded me so much of Lara Flynn Boyle's character in Men in Black 2 that I had a hard time taking her seriously.  Plus her compatriots looked like Matrix knock-offs.  Bottom line: very cool idea that spiraled toward a hokey climax. </p>

 <p> Poor Ian Stone. He's got girl troubles. His shape-shifting, reality-bending "ball & chain" found out about his mistress, his one true love, his Lois Lane. And not only is the tramp less attractive, she's from the wrong side of the tracks. So Medea will have to kill her rapscallion hubby-from-another-dimension because, umm, she's trying to win him back.Of course, it would be easy to just off the mistress because, as one character so aptly points out halfway through the film -- by which point the plot has expanded and imploded like an accordion at a zydeco stomp -- you only find true love once and, when that's no longer an option, you just sort of end up settling for second-best, i.e. Medea. Yes, you would think a dimension-hopping demon could just shift its "right arm" into what looks like a scythe (get it, they're Harvesters) made out of a heaping helping of CGI and slice Jenny Walker's jugular, but, excuse me, we still have about 80 minutes left to kill. So, on with the show already, Slipknot lookalikes!And if you know anything about the mythology behind "Medea," you know that she's all about hubby-killing. Girls with boy troubles will probably like that about this film. It's about the only thing I could figure out. There was a lot of mumbo jumbo about how love is stronger than fear and all that flower-humping hippie nonsense, and hide-and-seek action in the vein of Neo vs. the Matrix (or whatever Kurosawa film the Wachowski brothers stole that idea from), but that's just so you feel like you got your money's worth -- until you realize you've been duped like a chump guzzling smart drinks at a rave. </p>

 <p> Ian Stone (Mike Vogel) just can't stop dying horrible deaths. After each grisly demise, he wakes up in the middle of another (alternate) doomed existence. Yep, every day is Ian's final day on earth. Or is it? How and why is this happening? Who is the girl who keeps showing up in Ian's various incarnations? Who is the mysterious man? What are the seemingly indestructible creatures that keep murdering Ian? THE DEATHS OF IAN STONE is a thought-provoking twister w/ plenty of dismal atmosphere. The story is inventive and the monsters are evil and ugly (the way I like 'em!). Great stuff... </p>

 <p> Michelle Phiefer may look back and regret doing Grease 2. Mike Vogel will not look back and regret doing The Deaths of Ian Stone. From the Texas Chainsaw Massacre to Cloverfield to this one, Vogel is paving his road on the acting landscape. He seems to be waiting for that one "big" role that will place him with the higher tier of action/horror stars. This was a good movie. The "love conquers all, young lovers" theme is never tired. It ran well through Ian's lives well . The newness of this story was a breath of fresh air. Plenty of action. Enough romance, though their could have been more. Mysteries revealed at just the right time. The special effects were very good.You truly have to watch this one through to understand it all. Vogell posesses just enough vulnerabiltiy to pull off this starring role, in a genre that women have traditionally dominated as the victim/warrior/protagonist. His love interest was perfectly cast, being Stone's strength when he was weak. As much as I liked this movie, there was something missing. Maybe they should have spent a little more time on each life. I still give the movie a 3.5. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> "You know those days when everything seems wrong?" asks Ian Stone (Mike Vogel), an American living in England. "This is one of those days." As he sits in his car, he looks into the eyes of his girlfriend, Jenny (Christina Cole), feeling confused and frustrated--he's part of his college's Hockey team, and that rainy night, he cost them the game because of a faulty timer stuck on 5:03. After a few moments, he drops Jenny off and begins the drive home. At a railroad crossing, he sees a body lying in the middle of the road--he goes to check it, only to be attacked. The body is not a body at all, but rather a black, gaseous form with long limbs that shift into pointy objects. It immediately pushes Ian onto the railroad tracks, just as a train passes through. Only then does Ian suddenly wake up in an office building, sitting behind a desk with mounting paperwork. It's currently 5:03, and the boss wants a presentation ready by 6:00.These are the opening segments of "The Deaths of Ian Stone," a taut, mysterious, and ultimately disappointing film that pits the title character against a slew of alternate realities. He enters each new reality by somehow dying in the previous one, and he always enters by waking up at 5:03. Clearly, this is a fascinating idea, and up until about halfway, it works wonderfully. This is the point at which the tension builds itself up, with very little explained; basically, we can gather information only as Ian gathers it. Initially, not much is known apart from the recurring image of a clock displaying 5:03. We do see that he lives in London with his girlfriend, Medea (Jaime Murray), and that he's beginning to remember things that supposedly never took place. Example: he recalls being number seventeen on his college's Hockey team, yet his yearbook shows someone else in his place.An older man named Gray (Michael Feast) eventually approaches Ian under ominous circumstances. He claims to know what's happening to Ian, and he gives Ian elusive messages about remembering before it's too late, before "they" find him, kill him, and put him in a new reality. Of course, Ian is caught each and every time, awakening to find himself leading different lives. He's a cab driver. He's unemployed. He's a heroine junkie. Gray keeps reappearing as Ian jumps through realities, each time giving him another piece of the puzzle. We do learn that the dreaded "they" are actually Harvesters, ghastly supernatural shape-shifters that feed on human fear. Why this has to with Ian remains to be seen--he needs to find out soon, because if he doesn't, the Harvesters will keep on placing him in other lives.Does this not sound like a great story? For a while, it actually is. But at a certain point, it begins to get weird, and by the end, it crosses into ridiculous territory. It goes downhill fastest when many of the more vague aspects are explained, which is somewhat expected since explanations are almost never as satisfying as the mystery they hide in. I can't describe the plot twists in detail; what I can say is that Jenny is a common link to Ian and all of his manifestations. She reappears seemingly without any knowledge of her involvement. In each of Ian's lives, she doesn't look forward to visiting her mother; she doesn't want to be lectured over not being married with three children, like her sister. As Ian begins remembering this, Gray tells him that Jenny has to be protected because she's the key to stopping whatever is happening.Eventually, both Ian and Jenny begin remembering things that supposedly never happened, and this puts them at even greater odds with the Harvesters. It basically boils down to whom Ian and Jenny really are. By the time we find out, the story is no longer interesting--what begins as a fascinating, mind-bending supernatural thriller ends up as something that's bland and silly. Given the good start it gets off to, it's hard to understand how and why this happened. There are enough interest-piquing twists and turns, but they only amount to a film that lacks any real substance. I began to ask myself how much further the story would go; there's a point at which Ian is lying on a hospital bed, his arms and legs bound, his head trapped behind a metal restraint. Yes, the morbid nature of the device makes it fun to look at, but what does it add to the story? Why be weird just for the sake of being weird?I realize that I shouldn't be questioning weirdness, since that goes against everything that horror movies stand for. The thing is, I don't think "The Deaths of Ian Stone" is a horror movie--it certainly has elements of a horror movie, not the least of which are the demonic Harvesters. It felt more like a modern dark fantasy than anything else, and as such, I guess I was expecting a little more. The film's biggest problem is easy to identify: the story's ending doesn't do justice to the opening. I wish I could recommend the opening half of this film. I wish I could tell you to stay until the second half begins, at which point you should leave. But since that would defeat the purpose of going to the movies in the first place, the only remaining option is to not recommend the entire film. Ian Stone would probably die at those words, but who cares? It's not as if he won't come back in a different life. </p>

 <p> A horror version of Groundhog Day? Count me in! This excellent premise is unfortunately only pulled off half-heartedly. The visuals are very nice and the acting is good but the storyline gets so muddled eventually everything just loses all meaning. Some good blood here and there, definitely not a gory movie, but some nice violence sprinkled throughout. This is an average movie that could have been so much more, it may have come up short but it was still pretty entertaining. </p>

 <p> I have been watching the after dark horror fest movies and have found some I liked, and some that were just...well...stupid.  This is one of my top 3 favorites. The acting was suprisingly very good, and the graphics were well done. This movie is not one that really scared me.  However, it is freaky.  What impressed me about this movie is that it had such a good story to it, and it threw in a love story in the midst of all the demonic madness that worked with the movie without making it a love story, if that makes sense.  Yea, there is blood..but they didn't over do it.  And the demonic creatures are pretty scary, I would hate to wake up to one of those, but not one of those movies that really scared me like "The Abandoned."  Still, I would say this is my favorite so far.  Definitely worth buying. </p>

 <p> I choose this rating because the movie is good. What I like about the movie is that on an otherwise ordinary night, the young Ian Stone encounters a mysterious creature and is forced into the path of an oncoming train. Rather than facing certain death, Ian finds himself reborn into a new life that feels strangely familiar. After his second death, it becomes apparent that Ian is being hunted by an evil presence, and will be forced to die every day until he can solve the mystery of his own life. What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it. I would recommend this movie to other people. </p>

 <p> As far as After Dark...8 films to die for...this is definitely the best one that I have seen. Many of the others are merely average to below average. Ian Stone however breaks thats trend and for my tastes is a A-..B+ movie. Effects are outstanding and this plays more of the Sci-Fi-Fantasy with a pinch of horror.Women...what do you do. You cant live with one and you cant kill her but she can kill you...over and over. I thought this would be something I turned on and fell asleep to at about 2 in the morning. However within a few (10) minutes the story begins to move right along and does not let up. It never did drag at any point..in my opinion.I went into this show knowing nothing about it other than the title. This will spoil it.....but it is not merely a slice and dice. There is a other wordly feel to it which is exceptional...immortal beings that feed on fear however a few of them have a drug problem. That problem is that they discovered that the fear they feed on is most potent when their victim is dying. So instead of parasites that feed they become predators...living in the shadows..altering reality.I streamed this off Netflix then I turned around and bought it as it has replay value..a nicely done movie with belivable performances from the cast. </p>

 <p> "The Deaths of Ian Stone" is really more science-fiction than it is horror, so it may well be the oddest of the 8 films 2 die 4 that made up the 2007 version of the After Death Horrorfest.  Mike Vogel plays the title character, and after playing in a hockey game he is killed by an unseen creature.  But the next thing we know there is Ian, waking up in his office.  We might be tempted to think this Ian was just having a dream for the film's opening sequences, a common occurrence in horror films, but the title pretty much clues us in that this is not the case this time around.  When Ian Stone dies a second time it becomes clear that this is going to becoming his daily routine until he figures out what is going on.Being trapped in a day that keeps repeating itself or in your basic time loop has been a story line that has been used to great effect in the past.  The obvious reference point is "Groundhog Day," but there have been classic episodes of televisions shows such as "Star Trek The Next Generation" ("Cause and Effect"), "The X-Files" ("Monday"), "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" ("Life Serial"), and most recently a hysterical episode of "Supernatural" ("Mystery Spot").  Then again there was "Day Break," a recent television show based on that premise that quickly sank beneath the waves of low Nielsen ratings, so the premise usually works, but not always. The problem is once we, along with Ian, learn what is really going on, that we get to flip a coin as to whether we are more confused or unimpressed by the answer.  This is too bad because Vogel turns in a solid performance, within the limitations of the script.  The same cannot be said for Jaime Murray who plays the villainess (being named "Medea" by her parents was a big clue).  Murray is dressed up to look like she is the twisted cousin of Trinity from "The Matrix," and her deliver starts to sound more and more like she is trying to channel Natasha Romanov from "Rocky & Bullwinkle."  If you buy into the argument that the villain is the most important character in a movie like this, then you are  going to be disappointed on that score.I do not want to get into what is really going on in this movie because (a) finding out is the point of watching the film and (b) I am not sure I could explain it so that you would really understand it let along think it was a neat idea.  That would primarily be the shortcomings of the script by Brendan Hood ("They").  Director Dario Piana has plenty of CGI to play with, but there is really little going on with the pacing or editing of the film to make it particularly effective.  In the final analysis, I round up on "The Deaths of Ian Stone" because of Vogel's performance and because while I was disappointed with the results I was actually thinking of ways to improve the script.  Most of the other Horrorfest 2007 entries have not been worth the effort.  As you probably expect by now, all we get for bonus features on the DVD are the Miss Horrorfest Contest webepisodes (along with the trailers for Jessica Alba's "The Eye," theHorrorfest 2006)and2007sets. and "Wristcutters - A Love Story."  Reminds me of last year when I actually saw Horrorfest in the theater and before each and every movie they showed the trailer for "Captivity," a.k.a. the movie that never came to town.  Here I am three-quarters of the way through these eight films and already it is clear that last year's offerings, flawed as they were, were superior to this crop.Tonight the penultimate film of Horrorfest 2007, "Lake Dead."  The tag line is "Beneath its calm surface lies the deepest nightmare," so it has to be a more conventional horror film than this one (plus it is unrated which I know is suppose to indicate more blood and gore than the human mind can take, but really just means they did not bother to get it rated again when they added whatever they added to it--see how cynical I am getting in my old age?). </p>

 <p> I really enjoyed this movie.  It kept me interested from start to finish; and when I finally figured out the mystery to why Ian kept dying, it continued to keep me wondering what was going to happen next.  I really don't think I would have put this under the genre of horror; let alone the horrorfest....I would put it more into the category of sci-fi.  Anyway, it is good and worth seeing. </p>

 <p> I recommend this video.  Horror films can be quick and dirty these days, relying on special effects and mood music alone, while a monotone boring script with dull cliche acting clings on for dear life. There are not many films in the past few years in this genre that I can truly recommend, but I do suggest this one.  The unfolding events held my interest though the entire film, and I found that I actually cared what happened to the characters in this movie.  The script was above average, the acting was well done, and the special effects did not rule the movie but rather enhanced it.The plot is interesting.  A man has memory flashbacks of events that don't seem to match with his current life.  He feels out of place.  He knows something is wrong but can't figure out what it is.  This movie is primarily about a man in a desperate situation trying to remember his past, trying to recover lost memories, and trying to avoid being murdered by a supernatural stalker who wants him dead.  But Ian Stone can't die.  The stalker murders him, and Ian rewakes in a new life, new events surround him, and again he tries to remember who he is.  This repeats several times, until slowly he begins to remember, with the aid of a stranger who keeps appearing to him..., who he is, and what happened to cause all of this.The video worked well, no problems at all with the disks, audio and video were perfect.- Mike S. </p>

 <p> As far as the 8 films to die for series goes this one rates among the better ones.  It has it's story and sticks to it. The acting is actually very good and the story kept me interested.  The movie does get a wee bit on the cheesy side towards the end and I fee like there was some missed potential with this concept but it was definitely well worth the watch. My biggest complaint is how stupid the monsters look.  I really feel like they could have done a whole bunch more with them if they had taken to time. But if my only complaint is that the monsters are stupid then I think the movie did a pretty good job especially for a low budget film. If you get the chance to see this I don't think you will be disappointed. </p>

 <p> Of the films of Horrorfest 2007 I've seen so far, this is the best yet.  This one had a good idea, with our hero getting killed in various violent ways and then waking up to travel to another death in some other life scenario.  He's a college hockey player, then he works in an office and later he's a junkie and then.... Well, you get the point.  Anyway, there is a force behind all theses happenings and it is a sinister force.  This movie has violence, an original idea (at least for me it seemed original) and some really cool creatures that have one purpose...Scare people.  Well, they do that but they find something more satisfying.  I really enjoyed this one and have to put THE DEATHS OF IAN STONE as one I would easily recommend. </p>

 <p> The first time I watched this, I enjoyed it. Some part me believed it was because my crush on Vogel was at its strongest. So after letting a week go by. I decided to watch it again, just to make sure Vogel wasn't the only reason I enjoyed it. So I ventured out and rented it. Sufficed to say, TDOIS is still a good movie.The story begins with Ian Stone (Mike Vogel) as a hockey player in a University somewhere in the UK (Britain). He appears to make the winning shot until its revealed that the clock has stopped... two seconds before its supposed to. Everyone, including Ian himself, is confused and upset with the end result of the game. After giving his girlfriend, Jenny (Christina Cole), a ride home he finds a body on laid out on the road. However, when he goes to the man's aid he is attacked and dragged onto train tracks, where he's killed. Moments later, Ian wakes up in a office with no recollection of the previous night; Jenny is no longer his girlfriend, but a fellow colleague.Nothing appears off to him until his girlfriend, Medea (Jamie Murray), tells him that he has never played hockey, even if Ian remembers otherwise. To make matters worse, his brand new watch stops working the very next day. On the way to work, he is confronted by a mysterious man who tells him that he will be killed again, but he won't die. Upon learning this, Ian is pulled in and out of several lives whenever he is killed by his shadowy stalkers. The big question is why?Watching the movie for the first time was confusing. I wasn't even aware the main character had died until the old man said something to imply that he did. Of course, almost twenty minutes into the film you catch onto the process really easily. And in some way that does detract from the movie, but the characters are what kept me interested; That and not knowing if Ian [and Jenny] would survive his many encounters with the "Harvesters" (corrupt creatures that feed on fear ...and pain during violent deaths).A lot of people like to compare the movie Groundhog Day, but the title character isn't reliving one day and life, so much as he's jumping from one life to the next, thus making it a little more like Quantum Leap than the aforementioned. Also, the movie really isn't much of a horror movie, its more of a thriller. This is not say that it isn't scary; it had jumpy moments, all of which did scare me the first time around. There was plenty of "gore" to make the easily squeamish uncomfortable, but a lot of it isn't shown. However, when the film reaches its climax, it kind of borderlines on Sci-Fi a bit.The performances from all actors involved in the film are strong. I think this is what kept the film from dying for me. Mike Vogel proves he can carry a movie on his own, with him as the primary focus; He plays each role his character is given with believable ease. The fear, panic, and confusion in the face of his own demise was also pretty convincing. The supporting cast delivers exceptional performances as well; Particularly Jamie Murray, who plays his lover, Medea. My only problems with her character is that she seems to flip-flop between scorned lover, to twisted interrogator for her kind, who enjoys pain for pain's sake.Christina Cole (from What a Girl Wants) does what she can with her character Jenny and does it well. I would've loved to have seen more of her, but I suppose her screen time was limited to maintain anonymity. The old man (the actor and character's name escapes me) is probably the most interesting minor character, who acts as a sort of guide for Ian once he starts believing him.The creature and special effects for the most part, were done well. The late Stan Winston and his studio made the Harvesters pretty believable on a low budget. The CGI skillfully masks any problems one might have with the creatures. Everyone looked great in their make-up (assuming there was actually a non-CGI Villain-Harvester), except Mike Vogel. His Harvester variation was terrible and hardly convincing. It was a little hard to buy his performance when he was made up like that. I don't know why they just didn't model him after the others. On a final note, the story is a bit weak and the ending lies somewhere between rushed - yet somewhat satisfying (though I may be biased). If you can look past its short comings then I suppose you can still enjoy the movie. --- [A 4 out of 5]June 19th, 2008 </p>

 <p> I think this was one of the better After Dark movies in the 2nd year batch, it certainly kept my interest throughout and that's more than I can say about some of the other movies in this "event."This may not be a true horror film but it has enough elements to fit into the genre, more than Borderland or Tooth and Nail!  The story revolves around a man that keeps getting killed (is it a dream or reality?) and then wakes up to face death again.  Every day this cycle is happening and there is a girl that keeps showing up in his many "lives."The film has an interesting premise and it was a lot better than I had anticipated it being.  A horror groundhog day is not a bad way to put it but it's a little more than that.  There are some very intense scenes that almost leave you claustrophobic wondering if the protagonist is going to be able to ever get out of this ongoing cycle of death.The film is not overly bloody but there are some "painful" moments that the central character has to suffer through.  Others here have given a deeper synopsis of the plot but part of the fun in this movie is learning what is going on, so I will not go into any further detail.  I think this movie was fun and entertaining and it kept my interest, while it's not the greatest movie in the world it is a fun ride for 90 minutes no matter how implausible it might be. If you want a rollercoaster ride this is a good one to check out as the action really never stops as the main character slowly unravels the mystery. </p>

 <p> The Deaths of Ian Stone (Dario Piana, 2007)I'm not a filmmaker myself, which may be why I consistently fail to understand it when I see a movie that starts out with such incredible promise and then fails utterly. The Deaths of Ian Stone is the most recent of these I've seen. For the first thirty minutes, I was absolutely thrilled. Then it went to pieces, and instead of making any attempt at recovery, just got steadily worse from there.Ian Stone (The Sisterhod of the Traveling Pants' Mike Vogel), when we open, is a hockey player at a small college in what seems to be either Canada or America, though if so, it's a small town containing an incredible number of British expatriates. (Either that, or Vogel's character is an expat himself, though it's never mentioned.) After he blows the big game, he and his girlfriend Jenny (Casino Royale's Christina Cole) drive back to her place, exchange some deep, meaningful diagloue, then he heads home in a sudden rainstorm aswirl with ominous music. At a railroad crossing, he sees an injured man in the road. Going to help him proves fatal... until Ian wakes up from the nightmare. The first odd note comes a few seconds later, when we find out Jenny works in the same office-- and the two of them don't seem to know one another. Instead, Stone is living with sexy artist Medea (Dexter's Jaime Murray). What's going on? We have no clue.And that's what makes the first half-hour (of which I just gave you about half) of this movie so great-- we have no idea what on earth is happening, but these characters are at least interesting enough that we want to find out. And, at this point, they're still quite well-acted, though both Vogel and Murray go off the rails about halfway through the movie. Once the plot is outlined and we know what's going on, this turns from a slightly surreal existential drama into a standard survival-horror affair, and not a particularly well-made one either. ** </p>

 <p> The after Dark Horror Fest is a very appealing concept to horror fans, which we definately are. We were first introduced to this in 2006 where a handful of independent films were realeased under this festival only being shown in certain theaters. Since none of these theaters were close we had to wait until they were released on dvd. Unfortunately the wait was not worth it in any sense. Even for b lovers these films just plain [...]. Each one was a huge let down. The trailers made them look like films the horror indusrty needed but wound up being worse then most of the hollywood junk pumped out. This year we almost didn't bother but for the sake of b had to give horrorfest one more shot. The first viewing wasMulberry Street - After Dark Horror Fest (2007)which turned out to be pretty decent and far better then any of the prior years garbage but still not great. This time we picked up The Deaths of Ian Stone and couldn't be more pleased. This film could stand on it's own in the theaters and be killer. So if you compare it to any of the After Dark films none even come close to this.We start off at a hockey game where Ian Stone is in control of the puck and moving down the ice for a buzzer beater. He shoots and scores but the ref waves it off saying the clock ran out of time even though it clearly stopped with 2 seconds left. Despite his protest the game ended and he had no idea why. There was still two seconds left but nobody would recognize it (keep this in mind for things to come). After the game Ian is in the car with his girlfriend talking to her about the game then drops her off when he notices the clock in his car stopped. He pulls away and drives down the street where he see's someone lying in the middle of the road. He's hesitant but get's out of the car to see if the person is alright. One he walks up he can see that is no person laying there, it's more of a creature and runs back to his car. When he looks up the creature is no longer in the road. As he tries to pull away the creathure crashes through the windshield and rips him out placing him on the train tracks where he is run over. He then wakes up at a desk where he is asked to update some spreadsheets. So at this point you assume he's had an awful dream but thankfully that's not the case. The woman who was his girlfriend in the situation before now works with him but is just a co-worker. He goes home to his apartment where a different woman named Medea(Jamie Murray, Bill Murray's daughter) is his girlfriend. Stick with us it will make sense soon. He begins to talk to her about his hockey days in college and she says he never played hockey. He say's he'll show her his yearbook as prove he was # 17 on the team. He opens the book and sees there is a #17 player but it's not him, he's nowhere to be found. The next day he is approached by a man who explains to him that he is being stalked by forces who want him dead. The catch with it is that when he dies he immediately awakes but living a completely different life. Everytime his watch [...] stops that means they are coming for him. Yeah awesome. As he argues with the man he has no choice to believe him because one of the creatures snatches the old man up. Ian runs like hell as anyone would. These creatures are some of the creepiest looking things we've seen in ages. They look like large spirits but with skeleton faces and are smokey black with huge razor sharp hook hands. Once he gets back to his apartment he explains to his gilfriend something is after him then he gets a hook through the stomach. Yeah his old lady is one of them and explains this will continue to happen to him.In each death he starts a new life. He still looks the same and carries the same name but has very different situations. However in each situation his original girlfriend (not the creature one) is part of his life. He is then approached by the old man again who informs him he must not let these spirit creatures kill the girl. He has to protect her or else he has no chance of saving himself from this torment. The film continues at a rapid pace keeping you on the edge of your seat. We don't want to give any more away because we feel this is definately worth checking out. It has scares and suspense with an excellent original story.So as you can tell this one comes with a strong recommendation from us. It's actually a legit great film. Going into it we were simply looking to be midly entertained by some horror b but were completely stunned by a great work. These creatures in the film were some of the best ever. Extremely creepy and very real looking. Not quite sure what the budget of this film was but the end result was nothing short of genius. For any horror fan who seeks a very original plot with minor gore and true suspense this one has it. We're sure any of out fans would love it. </p>

 <p> Okay so i saw the behind the scene pictures of Deaths of Ian stone, more specifically pictures of the Harvesters (without the smoke and other special effects in the movie)in action and they loooked very well done. Think a long haired all black version of Mystique in the X-Men movies. Anyway, so I got to watch it and let me tell ya it was an incredible movie. i mean this is what B-rated movie is supposed to be about. A movie that doesn't have all the press (say of like Nightmare on elm street) to really rake in the millions but it's one of those dvd rentals that is fantastic to watch on a friday or saturday night. I know this was at the Horrorfest and techinically it started and did well at the movies but this reminds me of pre-blockbuster video store days when you could see horror movies that were incredibly done (good lighting, great effects, great acting, great storyline, etc).The only reason i didn't give this a five is because it premiered at horror fest and it's not really scary. I mean it's jump at you scary but i was expecting more blood or something and i usually don't like that, but for this festival it didn't seem R-rated all the time.Horrorfest definitely upgraded from last year as far as the quality! I don't know about the other movies but this one was good all around. I saw most of last years horrorfest movies and something about them made me feel like I was on the set instead of watching the movie. Some of the actors would look at the camera and stuff so, yeah this was an upgrade </p>

 <p> Of all the Horrorfest films for 2007, this one caught my eye from the trailer so it was the first I watched on DVD.  Others have reviewed the basic plot but to make a long story short... Ian Stone keeps getting killed in bizarre situations and wakes up in another life.  One day he's a hockey player, then an office worker, then a taxi driver.  But every time he wakes up, he brings elements of that former life with him.  Mostly his girlfriend and the demonic creatures that are murdering him.  Ian must figure out why these things keep killing him to save himself and the girl. (There.  Basic story with little spoilers)  This movie works because you know as little as Ian does and the fun comes in the solving of the mystery.  I don't think this should have been included in a "Horror" set because it is more sci-fi fantasy than classic horror.  (Although, if you would classify the tv version of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" as horror, then this qualifies)  I would put this right up there with tv's "Buffy" because it has a lot of the same elements.  In fact, I wish this were a backdoor pilot because the end leaves it open for more storytelling and I would definitely watch.  So, don't go into this expecting "Texas Chainsaw Massacre".  Go in with an open mind and you will find a little gem that is worth multiple viewings. </p>

 <p> The After Dark Horror Fest is a pretty inconsistent series.  Each year there are some gems in the bunch along with some duds.  The Deaths of Ian Stone would be filed under one of the duds in my book.The movies main fault is that it's not scary in the least bit and certainly shouldn't be considered a "horror" movie.  I'd categorize it more so as an action/thriller film.  The premise is interesting enough, especially if you're familiar with the Bill Murray movie "Groundhog Day".  I won't go over the plot since Amazon summarizes it up for you, but I found it to be a little confusing as it all unraveled.  Not only was it confusing, but also a little ridiculous.  As the movie went on I really didn't give a **** what happened to Ian Stone or his girlfriend...I just wanted it to end.As for the good, the acting seemed pretty decent (especially Ian's actor) and the special effects held up pretty well.  I still can't recommend this movie to fans of the After Dark series or horror fans in general.  Kathy Bates breasts in "About Schmidt" were scarier than this film.  Go watch "Borderlands" or "Frontiers" if you want to really see what this series has to offer. </p>

 <p> Imagine being trapped in some sort of fantasy world where you keep dying horrible deaths over and over and over, and can't escape or figure out why. Pretty creepy, huh? Well thats the premise of this particular outing from 2007's Eight Films to Die For.For those not in the know, its an annual limited run of indie horror movies by After Dark Films, and they tend to be quite original. While I wasn't able to make it to any of 2007's movies in the theatre, I have been steadily collecting them on DVD. So far, I've liked what I've seen. The first series of movies was incredible, but last years managed to out-do even those, so I must give my hats off to all involved. Great job!Now, as for this particular movie, it is set in Britain and follows the numerous deaths of one Mr. Ian Stone, who keeps getting killed by a supernatural force for some reason he can't remember. As his memories start coming back, we learn that he is trapped by... some sort of interdimensional beings.... demons, ghosts, whatever you want to call them. I don't want to go into too much depth, since it'd spoil the surprise. But the movie was very well done, though the ending was quite an abrupt change of pace. If you want spoilers, check out some of the other reviews. If you want to be surprised, go buy the DVD.As with the other 8 Films to Die For, we are given some bonus serials of the 2007 'Miss Horrorfest Contest,' which features a bunch of dark Gothic chicks fighting it out for their place as queen of the horror movie crowd. Quite good stuff actually, but not with all that much relevence to the movie I fear.All in all, it was quite a good outing, and I enjoyed it. But then, I'm also a big horror movie fan, so I might be a little biased here. Anyway, I'm going to continue my way through the rest of the 2007 set, steadily making my way up to Frontiers (which I VERY eagerly await). So far, so good! </p>
