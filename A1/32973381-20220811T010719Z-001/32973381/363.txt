 <p> Loved this zombie romance story. The zombies were unique and the romance was real.Jackson was a lovely female lead. She kicked ass and took names. Though underneath her tough kick ass exterior there was a lot going on. I feel like in a lot of zombie/post-apocalyptic books that people are a little too normal. Everyone just kind of accepts the end of the world and moves on. In Waking Up Dead I'm happy to say that's not true at all. Jackson has some really issues she's dealing with through out the book and they're presented in a very graceful way. Jackson doesn't have these issues to force the plot to move along or as story points. The issues, I feel, are what normal, everyday people would experience if the end of the world came about.The zombies. I love the zombies. The fast, smart, pus filled zombies are so fun. It's a different zombie than we're used to seeing. Yes, zombies are all sort of the same but these zombies are smart. They're learning, evolving and to me it spells the next step in zombie entertainment. Plus, you've got to love the pus.The ending left the option open for a sequel. I would definitely pick up the sequel to this book. So bring it on!Overall, Waking Up Dead is an amazing, sometimes gory, fun filled novel about a post-apocalyptic zombie ridden world. Anyone who likes zombies will like this book.I received an ARC e-book copy of this book from the publisher for an honest review. </p>

 <p> I really enjoyed reading Waking Up Dead, a post-apocalyptic zombie novel that provides a morbidly fascinating look at the stark reality and morality issues that survivors continue to face even two years after an outbreak that decimated society. The book successfully blends horror and romance together into an adrenaline-packed narrative that grabbed my attention from the start and kept me enthralled until the final sentence.The protagonist of the book is Jackson Hart, a symbolically fitting name for her character. &#8220;Jackson&#8221; is a name most often given to males, and throughout the book, over and over, Jackson defies traditional female stereotypes and there&#8217;s no doubt, this gal&#8217;s got a lot of heart, even though she tries to conceal it behind her tough faade.  She is a resilient, capable, skilled fighter in contrast to her petite physical frame.  With her trusty best friend, Mandy, the Machete, at her side, she has become adept at compartmentalizing her feelings and turning into a &#8220;death machine&#8221; when she must.  It doesn&#8217;t take Luke, her new traveling companion, long to realize she&#8217;s a &#8220;bad ass&#8221; who can take care of herself and doesn&#8217;t&#8217; need a man to protect her. Jackson&#8217;s character really makes you ponder the long-term effects of living in fear and having to kill on a daily basis and a central question raised is whether a person can ever really return from it to live a &#8220;normal&#8221; life.When Jackson and Luke meet while trying to escape zombies, there is an instant attraction and growing spark between these two seemingly different people, who in the pre-zombie world, would probably have never taken the time to get to know each other. Luke is a gorgeous man whose natural instincts are to protect, and he struggles with his overriding desire to protect Jackson when she clearly doesn&#8217;t need or want it. Luke has been lucky. He&#8217;s had a secure bunker to hole up in for the past year and he hasn&#8217;t been in the trenches like Jackson facing death around every corner. In their journey to reach a survival camp in Texas, Luke realizes that Jackson is much more experienced than he is in knowing how to survive with minimal resources and he has to check his ego every now because he doesn&#8217;t get to take on the traditional male role of caretaker and protector.The romance between Jackson and Luke develops over time, and it never overshadows the other dynamics of the story.  The deep emotional connection between them is so strong and it gives them the strength they need to keep going in the direst of situations. Their love story is a ray of sunshine in an otherwise bleak world. Their first love scene together is hot as they pour all of their unfulfilled desires and needs into one another, longing to escape, just for a moment, the loneliness and desperation that have become ingrained in their day-to-day existence. However, after that, their physical relationship moves into the background as the larger plot continues to unfold.One intriguing aspect of the story is the subtle evolvement of the zombies as Jackson and Luke come to the horrifying realization that not all of the zombies are the mindless, animalistic creatures they&#8217;ve been killing for the past two years.  The waking dead&#8217;s actions, behaviors, and calculating expressions indicate they are becoming more intelligent over time.  Concerns about the morality of killing these questionable beings are raised as the survivors observe and learn more about them.I loved how the author pulled me into the story, made me feel on edge about the constant looming danger of the waking dead. The climax of the book was extremely intense and brought out so many emotions in me. I&#8217;m not one to get easily teary-eyed, but I couldn&#8217;t help but get caught up in the deep emotional anguish, anger, pain, and sadness that engulf the characters, and the heartbreaking decisions they must make.I received a copy of this book from the author for an honest review. </p>

 <p> Wow. That was the word that went through my mind with every word that I read. I love all things zombie, and this book did not disappoint. To tell you the truth, I actually kicked myself when I finished reading it, because I was so convinced this was going to be a rip-off of The Walking Dead that I had convinced myself it won't be as good as The Walking Dead  before I even started reading it. But boy was I wrong.Emma Shortt amazes us with her writing style and plot twists. She manages to create a heroine that I am not ashamed to admire. Sure, it's the zombie apocalypse, if you don't learn to kick butt, you die, but she makes Jackson (the heroine) so awesome at kicking zombie butt, it makes the guys in every zombie movie look like a bunch of wimps.Jackson has been travelling on foot for the past two years, to makes it to what she hopes is a camp of survivors in Texas. She loses her friend Tye along the way, but it's okay, because we are introduced to the lust-worthy, Luke Granger.These two characters provide enough sexual tension to make any normal person combust, as they journey toward Texas together and when they finally come together, zombies be damned. The characters are fresh and fun, providing a read filled with everything you would expect from a budding romance in the post-apocalyptic world.Emma Shortt gives the typical zombie a twist. She provides the theory that zombies are becoming more intelligent with each passing day. They are plotting and planning, working in packs and forming hordes, to satisfy their hunger. Something which I am sure will be the topic of many debates to come.Waking Up Dead was the source of some pretty weird dreams for me the past week, and it gave me chills as I sat reading it. It definitely had me gasping out loud at some pus-filled zombie scenes, but reading Luke's POV when he first sees Jackson, more than makes up for it."Jesus Christ it was a woman, her ass outlined in flimsy purple panties, running almost as fast as he, straight into the local rec center."I'm pretty sure the purple panty revolution will be starting one of these days. Because we wouldn't want to be caught wearing ratty, off-white panties when a bunch of zombies are chasing us, now would we?All in all, Emma Shortt amazed me, not only with her story, but with her way with words. This book is wonderfully written and kept me in suspense. In fact, I am still in suspense, because I NEED to know what happens next. I'll be waiting patiently for the next book, but until then, from one zombie-freak to the rest of the world, you do not want to miss this! </p>

 <p> This is a zombie tale told from a duel point of view. First we meet Jackson who is an extremely strong and independent female. She has been traveling with Tye for the past month or so. She has been surviving for the past 2 years by living moment to moment. She has had no concistentcy with food or shelter. She has even had to eat rat. Blech. Her and Tye are traveling to Texas where they heard there was a survivor camp.Next we meet Luke. Luke found an underground bunker early into the apcolypse. He has been living well with tons of stored food, running water, and a bed. But he is all alone.Luke and Jackson's paths end up crossing through a series of events that you will just have to read about. And their adventure continues together...- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Damn. Those zombies were smart. I've read other zombie books that hint at zombies evolving into a smarter species but nothing like in this book. The zombies set traps, climbed onto rooftops, and dug tunnels. They became expert hunters and trappers. And they were fast. Reminded me of the Dawn of the Dead remake.And this was a very fast paced book. Lots of gore, blood, and pus. </p>

 <p> Review:I loved Waking Up Dead!  It's got a little bit of everything - intense action scenes, gooey zombies, and even a romance that develops over time as the protagonists flee from the north to Texas.  Jackson is a kick-ass heroine who doesn't need anyone to take care of her, and in fact, she saves Luke many times with her fighting skills.  If it hadn't been for a recent Candy Crush addiction, I wouldn't have been able to put it down!  Curse you, Candy Crush!I really liked the protagonists.  Jackson has been on the run, hiding from zombies since the virus broke out 2 years ago.  She is understandably traumatized, pushing all of the horrible things she's seen and been forced to do behind thick mental walls that she defends as fiercely as she defends herself against the waking dead.  Luke, on the other hand, has had things pretty good.  He found a bunker, has had food, power, and even running water.  He hasn't had to live on the razor edge of fear and adrenalin that Jackson has.  He is clean, warm, and well fed, compared to the calorie deprived Jackson.  He's rather content in his bunker.  He doesn't think the zombies can get in, and he only ventures out when necessary.  When he does leave because the zombies that usually pound unceasingly on the roof of the bunker suspiciously disappear, he thinks they might have found another human.  Curious and wanting to save them because he is lonely, he discovers Jackson fleeing down the street in her panties.  Yes, her panties, and believe me, it made more sense when I was reading it than when I just typed it.After they hook up, circumstances force them to flee from the bunker.  Jackson wants to find her friend and traveling companion, Tye, who is missing, and so she sets off for Texas, where they had been traveling to.  She has heard that there are survivors there, and because Luke no longer has a safe space, he agrees to go with her.  What a hair-raising journey!  There were several zombie encounters that left me terrified.  I quickly came to the conclusion that if there ever is a zombie apocalypse, I will not be fortunate enough to survive for an extended period of time.  That Jackson has been beating them off for two years is an amazing feat, and Luke is impressed and thankful to have her with him, especially when she repeatedly saves him from becoming zombie chow.I felt a real connection with both characters.  Jackson has morphed into a lean, mean, and merciless zombie killing machine.  If she saw herself before the dead woke up, she wouldn't even recognize herself. She has been slaying the dead for so long that she can't remember doing anything else.  When they finally do discover survivors, she is at a loss.  How can she contribute to the small community when the only thing she's good at is killing zombies?  She has an internal struggle to deal with, because a part of her thinks that maybe the zombies aren't complete monsters, even though all they want to do is eat her.  This coupled with her self-doubts about being a valued member of her new society makes her a very sympathetic character.  Poor Jackson! All she thinks about is being safe from the monsters, but after she is, she is at odds with her new state of being.The zombies rocked.  They are fast and brutal, and as the story moves forward, there are hints that they are evolving and becoming more intelligent.  What's more frightening that a zombie?  A fast, smart zombie!  Argh!The romance is sweet (don't worry, there are hot times, too) because both Jackson and Luke think they are going to die at any time.  Life is short and precious in the time of the dead.  Jackson is afraid of getting attached to Luke and then losing him, just as she has lost every other person that she has loved.  Luke, too, is at first reluctant to allow his emotions free rein.  Heartbreak seems certain, and neither of them is sure they can survive yet another loss.Things bogged down a little once they reached Texas and safety.  Thankfully, the safety doesn't last long.  There is no getting rid of the zombies, even when you have a fortified wall to shelter behind.If you enjoy romances with horror elements, this is the book for you.  I loved it, and it is easily one of the best adult zombie books that I have read.  I hope I don't have to wait too long to see what happens next.Grade:  A- </p>

 <p> Story Rating ~ 5 StarsHero Rating ~ 5 StarsHeroine Rating ~ 5 StarsRomance Rating ~ 5 StarsHeat Level ~ 2.5 StarsEnd Rating ~ 5 Stars, but to be continued!Overall ~ 5 GIGANTIC STARS!!!WOWEEEEE!!! Now that was one exciting, nonstop, exhilarating read. This book grabbed me right from the get go and did not even let up when the ending came. I still can't believe what I just read, it totally AMAZED me. Now I'm sitting here wanting the next book so bad, and the next and the one after that one too. Yep, lucky me, because there are going to be at least 3 more books to come in this series and I for one plan on reading each and every one.This book starts out 2 years after the zombies have starting taking over the world.The heroine Jackson, and her friend Tye, who is like a brother to her, are out searching for food when they get separated. The zombies are out in full force, hunting for food too, so that means it's time to kill or be killed. Jackson, she was one kick-ass heroine. Her, and her machete that she named Mandy, are a force to be reckoned with. As she runs and plots her way out of a bad situation, she meets the hero, Luke and from first sight, he is attracted to Jackson. He can hardly believe how tough she is, and even though he knows she can take care of herself, he still feels very protective of her. They set off to Texas to look for survivors, and also hoping to find Tye. Everything they go through is so crazy. These zombies are very gruesome and relentless, they are fast and they have no fear, and are driven by hunger and stop for nothing. The really bad thing is, they are getting smarter and are starting to plot how to trap their food. I loved how the author put her own spin on the zombies. She made them so unique, used her imagination, and made them truly her own creation.As the book moves along, Luke and Jackson are growing closer. I liked the fact that they did not just give in to their sexual needs and waited until it really meant something to each other. There were not a lot of heated scenes, but the ones we got made it so much more gratifying because they waited until the time was right. I definitely felt the feelings they had for each other, even though they were not said until much later in the book.Do they make it to Texas? Do they find Tye or anymore survivors? I'm not going to tell you, you're just going to have to find out for yourselves.I HIGHLY recommend this book to those of you who are fans of the TV show, The Walking Dead.Warning...this book is NOT for the faint of heart. Lots of violence and pus-filled, vicious, human eating zombies!!! </p>

 <p> Loved it! Eagerly waiting for book 2, whodda thunk, romance and zombies, but it works here. I think what I liked most about this, was that if zombies really did exist, the book felt real. The scenarios, the situations they found themselves, and the new mythos being created with these zombies. There's not a thing about this book I would change, I absolutely loved it and devoured it in one sitting.Although I will say, I'm not a fan of the cover. I almost passed it up to be honest because the cover is pretty bad. But End of Days Love sold me, I just had to read more with a subtitle like that and I'm so glad I did. </p>

 <p> Wow. Wow. And more Wow. Although I've been interested in end-of-days, dystopian literature for years, I've only recently become a zombie fan. (Thank you, Walking Dead). My interest was instantly piqued when this book came across our groups' request queue.  With its combination of these two genres it definitely did NOT disappoint. This series is going to be EPIC for zombie fans. It will definitely be my #2 (second only to the previously mentioned, and they've had years to work on their storyline).Jackson is a kick-@$$ chick that has been through a literal hell on earth and has evolved and survived to get where she is now. Luke has had it easy comparatively and must step up his game now that he and Jackson are making their way south.  I liked that he tried to take care of her and had a protective instinct, which is rare trait nowadays. Their chemistry is obvious, and it was a nice change of pace to see a little positive in a world full of negatives at every turn. The twist of the zombies getting smarter was unique and gives more anticipation to reading the story. I loved it and I can't wait for the next installment!Rating: 4.5HEAT Rating: Blood ThirstyReviewed By: Daysie W.Review Courtesy of: My Book Addictions and More </p>

 <p> Can there still be romance after zombies overrun the world? If you want the answer to be yes then don't hesitate to grab a copy of WAKING UP DEAD. I've been dying (no pun intended) for this book to come out and since I first saw Shortt share the cover months ago. Sometimes you just know a book is going to be your thing and if you like your romance novels to have heroines who aren't shrinking violets in the face of life-or-death danger as much as I do this book is for you.Jackson could be any girl. She's been through hell and in the two years since the end of the world began she's become the girl no one wants to be, yet hopes they could if they had to. She's a fighter. When she and her traveling companion get separated and she crosses paths with Luke she's tearing through town without her pants. I wish I could say I'd be as much of a warrior in my undies while running from zombies. Luke's had it a lot easier holed up in someone's bunker but they've both discovered that something new is happening with the zombies. Their only chance is to head South in search of a rumored stronghold of survivors. Along the way they face more horrors and find that maybe the best part about the old world isn't gone for good.If you hate summer because you need your weekly dose of The Walking Dead you will love the constant tension and fear that Jackson and Luke must survive in. I absolutely loved that she was the more experienced of the two when it came to dealing with the zombies. It's a great change of pace from the Alpha-male-saves-the-day-like-a-bulldozer stuff. That Luke was never threatened by it made him especially cool in my eyes. That Shortt addresses the idea that they might be interested in one another because they have no other option is important and she does it in an organic way that makes it good. The sexual tension is great and the added tension of the setting makes this a delicious read on so many levels.The only thing holding me back from a full five stars was that it didn't end anywhere near when I expected it to. I don't want to spoil anything but there's a lot more story than I anticipated&#8212;and it's GOOD&#8212;but it also puts Jackson into a place where she's a little tough to like for a while. If you ever want to bonk a character in the noggin for being stupid about something you'll get what bugged me when you read it. By no means a deal breaker, just hit one of my peeves as a reader.From start to finish this is one heck of an adventure with a great romance element that is sure to delight urban fantasy and horror fans who also dig romances. Love paranormal romances but in need of something a bit meatier? I definitely recommend this one if you enjoy Lisa Kessler or Devon Monk's work. That this is just the first in a series delights me to no end, enjoy!Notes: ARC received via publisher. </p>
