 <p> A couple in love at the right place at the right time, girls captive to human traffickers and an impending storm that threatens all of their lives add up to quite a ride. From the first line, H.I. Weggley drops you straight into the action.Pineapple Express was enjoyable to read with plenty of action for the adventure lover and romance for those who enjoy that element of a story. Thoughout the book, there is an emphasis on doing things God&#8217;s way, whether it&#8217;s fighting for those who can&#8217;t fight for themselves or keeping oneself pure in a romantic relationship.In a few places, it felt like the point of the dialogue was to tell the audience something and other places the technical explanations went over my head. But neither of these bumps took away from my enjoyment of Pineapple Express. H.L. Wegley has weaved together an action filled story with purpose. I really appreciate how he calls attention to the awful reality of human trafficking and the need to take action. </p>

 <p> This book is a cover to cover rollercoaster ride of action and romance. Caught between bad guys trafficking young girls, a storm threatening to wash away the coastline and a boss who doesn't want to listen, Jennifer and Lee are stuck literally between a rock and a hard place.Not a book that's easy to put down. </p>

 <p> As Jenn tries to find where young girls are being held, her weatherman fiance helps her get through the storm. A storm is putting it mildly, but they need to be sure of where the girls are before the FBI can come stop the human- trafficking ring.  This book is non-stop action all the way to the end.  Once I started, it was hard to put it down.  There are hints to a book before this that I did not read that explains how Jenn and Lee got together, but this book does well on it's own.  I was given a copy of this book for my honest review. </p>

 <p> H. L. Wegley has written an interesting novel using the social issue theme of human trafficking, especially the sex trafficking trade. Without delving deep into the depravedness of the minds of those criminals, Wegley has highlighted the dangers of this horrendous crime and how it has reared its ugly head in today's times.Although simplistic in style, the action and characters will grab at all ages of readers.I did find this book to be geared towards the Young Adult (New Adult) crowd. I would have preferred to see a little more action, a little more grittiness (without compromising Christian morals, of course), and a little less kissing.For any reader On the Pineapple Express not only brings to light what &#34;Pineapple Express&#34; means (a little new knowledge for me) but also the reality of the trafficking.I would encourage this book to be read by all teenagers. Let them understand the dangers of the real world and &#34;over-sharing&#34; themselves on social media. They can become prime targets and there may not be a &#34;Jennifer&#34; or &#34;Lee&#34; to rescue them.At the end of the book a great message is sent informing about these dangers and there is a list of how the reader can help and/or become involved in defeating this horror.Good book, good read, and a most definite for teenagers and young adults. I look forward to reading Hide and Seek, which is book 1, and book 3: Moon Over Ma'alaea Bay.Way to go, H.L. Wegley! </p>

 <p> WOW! If you like romance, and you like thrillers, this story will keep you on the edge of your seat, holding your breath as you slip and slide and slither around with Lee and Jennifer as they search for these girls.Jennifer is obviously not one to sit around and wait for someone else to lead the way no matter how dangerous a situation is. She follows her heart, and her heart is leading her to save these girls from a fate truly worse than death! And although Lee would rather be a bit more careful and circumspect, he trusts his brilliant fiance to lead the way (especially since he can't stop her).These two make quite a pair! Grab a copy, you won't regret it! </p>

 <p> Harry Wegley brings us another fast paced, exciting story. It highlights an important issue in today&#8217;s times&#8212;sex trafficking. The primary characters, Lee Brandt and Jennifer Akihara are intelligent, determined and strong in their Christian faith. They discover young girls are being held captive and will be smuggled out of the country, and immediately take action. Hampered by a powerful storm system which prevents the FBI from helping, they have to rescue the captives themselves. Non-stop action and tension keep you turning the pages in a fast paced race against disaster. The close point of view puts you in their heads and lets you feel the tension. I think the novel would have benefitted from being longer, allowing the author to explore newly formed relationships, and perhaps add a few twists to the plot.I do not personally know the author, but I was provided a copy of this book for the purpose of giving a review. This review is my honest opinion of the book: not one just intended to promote sales. That said, it was an enjoyable task to read it&#8212;I hope you will like it too. </p>

 <p> On the Pineapple Express is a fast-moving, adrenaline-laced adventure, clean and gripping. The banter between Jennifer and Lee provides breaks in the tension, but not for long. It's also a story with some surprising, heart-warming moments.With time running out, and a killer storm moving in, Jennifer and Lee take some crazy risks to find the human traffickers' hideout.Human trafficking is one of those hard-to-read-about subjects, but H. L. Wegley delivers a story even teens could read without scarring themselves. It helps that the buyers want these girls &#34;unspoiled.&#34; And readers don't see inside the girls' heads, although we're told that one of them hanged herself with her own shoelaces rather than face what their captors had planned.[Review copy provided by the publisher for an honest review.] </p>

 <p> This book grabs you from the first page and does not let up.  First book I have read by this author, but will not be my last.  I love suspense and this book is full of it.  As I said fasten your seat belts for a thrill of a ride.  Hurricane, human trafficking just to name a few.  I could not put this book down.  Recommend to anyone who loves suspense and romance.  I rate this author right up there with the top Christen suspense authors. </p>

 <p> This is an exciting and timely suspense novel focusing on human trafficking of girls and young women. The entire book is a roller coaster ride of breath-stopping action.This is the second of a 4-book series, and although it can stand alone, I imagine that readers might like to read the first book, Hide and Seek, before reading On the Pineapple Express. I hadn&#8217;t read the first book, which made me feel somewhat removed from the main characters, since the backstory is frequently referenced.My favorite character is Katie, who is one of the girls who has been captured in the US to be sold internationally. She is intelligent and very courageous.Since the majority of the book is very intense and moves so quickly in life and death situations, I had a bit of a hard time accepting the romantic behavior that the main characters consistently display. It sometimes seems a little out of sync with the current setting. New adults and teens might not see it as being unusual.This book is not only good fiction, it is very informative. I think it&#8217;s appropriate for teens, especially, who need to be alerted to the dangers of human trafficking. On the Pineapple Express would be a good book for parents to read and then pass on to their teenagers.It is obvious by the story that Jennifer and Lee are very committed Christians. Their spiritual life is a big part of the story, because it defines their thinking and actions.If you like romantic suspense, especially if you are concerned about the burgeoning sex-traffic trade, then you will want to read this book. </p>

 <p> &#8220;God&#8217;s better than bullets,&#8221; says one of the characters in H. L. Wegley&#8217;s Christian suspense novel, On the Pineapple Express. But this is no tale of simple thrills and deus ex machina. The God of this novel is very real. The primary characters are believable, authentic Christians, with real problems and concerns. And the situation, while providing fodder for a fun, exciting tale, is sadly all too real as well&#8212;girls are indeed kidnapped and sold into slavery, and it is an issue inviting our concern.The author combines real issues and real faith into pure, thrilling fiction with expert ease. The novel never feels preachy. The situations never feel contrived. And the characters never feel false, even when contemplating the beginnings of new faith.The Pineapple Express, bringing warmth, wind and rain from Hawaii to Seattle, provides an authentic and scary backdrop to this tale. Nature&#8217;s violence competes with the violence of men, and scary scenes of wild waves and falling trees are evocatively portrayed. Meanwhile an authentic love is displayed, with pleasingly faithful restraint, between the two main protagonists.Fast-paced, exciting, scary, violent when necessary, and always Christian, this is a great book with twin messages, of faith and fact, for teens and adults of all ages.Disclosure: I won a free ecopy during the author&#8217;s blog tour. </p>
