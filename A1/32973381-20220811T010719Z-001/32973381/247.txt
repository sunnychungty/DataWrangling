 <p> Dr. Taylor Briggs (Dead Calm's Billy Zane) is in Brazil for a conference on Alzheimer's disease. He is called upon to consult on an unusual case involving a man covered in a strange orange powder. Briggs is accidentally contaminated by this substance (which he later finds out is only used in ancient tribal rituals). This results in what appear to be blackouts and hallucinations. As the days pass, Briggs realizes that these experiences are actually 30 year old memories from someone else's life! Not just any memories, but those of a serial killer! Briggs becomes obsessed w/ finding out the truth behind these visions. MEMORY is a fast-moving tale of mystery and suspense w/ mystical overtones. Zane is believable as Briggs, and Dennis Hopper, Ann-Margret (Magic, Tommy), and Tricia Helfer do admirable jobs, especially Ann-Margret, who adds a nice jolt to this thriller! And yes, she's still beautiful! Remember to add this one to your collection... </p>

 <p> I'm a Billy Zane fan and when I saw Memory had some good reviews I jumped on it. Like a swimmer not seeing the rocks in the water below before he leaps...Plodding. Obvious. And please Billy, if you once more verbalized your interior thoughts I thought I'd scream.I was disappointed enough to advise anyone else to:Save your money. </p>

 <p> The good reviews for this movie promted me to watch it. I felt it was much better than most of the crappy horror films out there now, but it seemed to drag on forever. Although it was a snooze fest of a movie, it did have its somewhat entertaining moments and was'nt a complete waste of time. </p>

 <p> Well...here's a neat little mystery to boggle the mind: a scientist is experiencing memories of someone else...and said memories consist of a strange mask wearing figure, abduction of little girls, and murder. The movie is highly confusing while watching it, and is summed up in the final showdown near the end. AS if this isn't enough, there's one final shocking twist at the final scene...which is just breathtaking and exhilerating, in my opinion. It was such a warm and heartfelt ending, full of emotion and love and..hope.I still need to rewatch it so I can fully comprehend the plot. It's definately one that keeps you thinking long after the end credits have gone by. If you like mind benders that require full attention..and then some...you must see this movie! </p>

 <p> Given  the material and cast, one would have  expected a superior movie. It is not,  but it is sufficiently entertaining to warrant seeing it if the cost of doing so is modest. Admittedly, I was  somewhat more bewildered by the story line than the average; there were no subtitles and some of the explanatory scenes were inaudible.  It is a fairly ancient type of  plot, rampant in films since psychoanalysis (Freudian, Jungian, etc.) become an everyday occurrence of many writers, directors and actors. The plot handles these themes of memory and its relationship to real life with no more than average effectiveness with a fair degree of incoherence reducing the impact of the relevant scenes. What should have been a shocking highlight became only a moderately interesting denouement. The actors could have done a much better job if the scenes were better constructed.Overall, the appeal of the cast makes up for deficiencies elsewhere and makes this a decent though not special movie for an evening's viewing. </p>

 <p> Memory is a direct-to-DVD mess that never really finds a home.  The acting and execution is pretty good - I was drawn by the Billy Zane and Dennis Hopper combination - but it's just too messy to function properly.  At times a psychological thriller with anthropology roots, at others a family drama with hints at cyber predators, the best I can say is that it's mostly science fiction.Dr. Taylor Briggs (Billy Zane) is a neurologist who has devoted his professional life to curing the disease (Alzheimer's) affecting his mother.  While at a conference abroad in the Amazon, he is consulted on a bizarre local case of a man, ostensibly American, who is covered in red dye and in possession of an unusual MRI.  The MRI shows tumors that have specifically targeted the memory centers of the brain.  When Dr. Briggs accidentally becomes exposed to the mystery patient, he begins having recurring black-outs and dreams that cause concern.  Together with a retired doctor (Hopper - who is criminally underused) and a few assorted but relatively unimportant friends, Briggs discovers the cause for his hallucinations and dark dreams may tie together his broken past and the sickening exploits of a serial killer.Essentially this movie reminded me of a pedophile's version of [Kiss the Girls]], but with the "inside the killer" genre.  It's not bad, mind you, but there is a reason it didn't go to theatres.Jason Elin </p>

 <p> When I started watching this movie it didn't look too good--all the previews were grade B trash and that's exactly what I was anticipating during the opening credits.  It's surprisingly good, although I'm still not sure I understand the plot in it's entirety.For instance: why would exposure to some guy's shamanic memory serum all the sudden turn Billy Zane on a specifically personal quest to find out who his real father was?  Does the memory serum itself have some kind of good willed soul that steers him in this direction?  Why wouldn't it just make him nuts with all sorts of memories at once until it got out of his system?I really wished Dennis Hopper had turned out to be the maniac; after all, he seems like one anyway, even as the benevolent scientist "would be" father of Zane's character.  The hallucinations in this film range from hokey to very, very effective; Ann Margret gives a chillingly effective performance as the torchbearer of a very perverse evil.  At times this reminded me of Hitchcock's "Spellbound" and at other times like the crazier parts of "Rambo 3": it's almost as though Roger Corman and Luis Bunuel decided to take the reigns together in an unlikely collaboration.Nonetheless, the plot keeps you guessing and the ending is actually pretty shocking. </p>

 <p> "Memory" starts off by providing the correct pronunciation of the word and what appeared to be the complete dictionary definition of the term.  For some reason this made me think of "Memento," which was a mistake because this horror thriller is nothing like that ambitious film.  Billy Zane stars as Dr. Taylor Briggs, who was exposed to some strange stuff in Brazil that is causing him to have flashbacks.  What is odd is that these appear to be somebody else's flashbacks, and to make things even more interesting the memories seem to be those of a serial killer who targets young women.  Given how old the memories appear to be the only cast member running around who would seem to fit the bill is Max Lichtenstein, who is played by Dennis Hopper, which moves the serial killer possibility into the realm of the so patently obvious that you have to discount it (the music cues only reinforce such suspicions since the movie is trying so hard to nudge us in his direction).  But Briggs has family issues, so we pay attention because such exposition is also the key to unraveling the mystery, such as it is.Beyond the "who" the more interesting question is the "how," because picking up on somebody else's memories is not something that happens every day.  The need to solve such mysteries never really gets beyond the "because they are there" stage, and for my money "Memory" is harmed by attempting to explain the science behind what is happening.  When somebody such as myself, who never even got as far as taking high biology, rolls their eyes and laughs out loud at the idea that memories can be contained in DNA, then it must really be bad.  It occurs to me that this sort of scientific mumbo-jumbo could have worked decades ago on something like "The Twilight Zone," but then Rod Serling, Richard Matheson, and the rest of the "Zone" writers were all about the payoff, and that is where "Memory" suddenly looks like somebody slipped in the last real from another horror film.  I swear, if you fell asleep for five minutes and woke up during the final scenes you would think that you had slept through the end of one movie and were watching the conclusion of the second on a Billy Zane-double feature.  I would accuse this film of  engaging in bait and switch except there is no reason to assume those responsible for this film were thinking that far ahead."Memory" is directed by Bennett Davlin, who co-wrote the script along with Anthony Badalucco and Russ Turley, which might explain why the ending seems so unlike the rest of the movie.  The other major characters in the story are Tricia Helfer of "Battlestar Galactica" fame as Stephanie Jacobs, an artist who becomes Briggs' romantic interest in the film (yes, she does a nude scene, but, no, there is nothing to see, so do not rent "Memory" in that hope) and Ann-Margaret as Carol Hargrave, the owner of a Gallery who sets up the introduction of the scientist and the artist.  I was wondering why Ann-Margaret bothered to make this movie, because in 2006 she was having something of a mini-comback what with making "The Break-Up" and "The Santa Clause 3 - The Escape Clause."  Therefore it would hardly seem necessary for her to make a movie like this one unless she gets to do something a bit different, which she does, so that may have been part of the rationale.  But then I discovered this film was really made in 2005 and sat on the shelf for a while, which strikes me as bizaare given all the crap that goes direct to video.  This film might fail more than it succeeds, but it does feature a pretty good cast for this type of movie. </p>

 <p> Memory is a sleek thriller that starts off slow and quickly builds into a cascading tide of action. It's very much in the style of Alfred Hitchcock and is one of my favorite movies out this year.Roughly, the plot is that a memory researcher is exposed to an unknown substance that causes him to start experiencing memories that happened before he was born. He sees a masked figure in a Burberry coat chasing through the woods. At first he thinks he's going insane, but when he realizes the masked figure could be a serial killer, he must do whatever is necessary to bring the decades old nightmare to an end. I can't say much more without giving spoilers :>The main review on Amazon says there are little in the way of surprises. I disagree. There ARE twists and turns in the plot, and even in the ending. I normally can see where these movies are going, and this one managed to surprise me.I absolutely loved this movie. Billy Zane is a strong, dramatic actor and his performance is a pleasure to watch. I also appreciated the lack of gore and nudity in the film. Lately, too many sloppy productions have attempted to mask their short comings with excessive gore or gratuitous nudity, but with few shortcomings, this movie has little to mask.If you're a fan of Hitchcock mystery thrillers or in the mood for a psychological thriller, please give this movie a shot.Highly recommended. </p>

 <p> Memory (Bennett Davlin, 2006)Generic thriller that doesn't utilize Billy Zane's talents nearly enough. Zane plays a doctor who, while on a trip to Brazil to give a lecture, is asked to consult on a mysterious patient at a nearby hospital. While there, he is exposed to a substance discovered deep in the Amazon that seems to be exposing him to memories that aren't his--memories that were generated by a serial killer while he was committing his crimes. Dennis Hopper has a turn as the doctor's father, basically playing that Dennis Hopper character--quirky, cracked, not that far away from the edge. The whole thing feels kind of phoned in, and while the mystery angle that develops is worthwhile, I felt that there could have been a great deal more to this than there was. **  </p>

 <p> I waited so long to see this film, finally it opened here in New York City and I rushed to see it!  Had a hard time at first following the plot, but slowly it all came together, especially after veteran actress Ann- Margret comes on screen as Carol Hargrave.  I have never seen Ann Margret in this type of role and she really does a great job!  REally love the film, the DVD has some great extras for aspiring film makers too! </p>

 <p> With all these stars, how could you not love this movie? The movie plot was different. Let us supposed you got infected by a chemical which allowed you to relive your parent's memories from before you were born and then let's suppose the parent is a serial child abductor and killer. Toss in a girlfriend and you got our story.I would like to point out if you have someone else's memory you should not be seeing yourself as a third person, nor should you be seeing what that other person does not see. That makes simple logical sense which was forgotten by the film makers. Once we get a glimpse of this memory we become more interested in the memory then the boring life of our lead actor.I got bored with the story waiting for the guy to have another memory flash. The memory flashes were too far apart in the beginning to hold my attention. </p>

 <p> Is this a supernatural tale or a mystery-drama? It's a legitimate question you may ponder from its beginning, but bear with it and soon you realize it deals with real human beings, and what each is or is not capable of doing. It is a tale of extended family and friends and deeply suppressed memories. Billy Zane, Ann-Margret and Dennis Hopper star. To keep from inadvertently adding plot spoilers I will refrain from delving deeper so you may make this journey of discovery for yourself. I think you will enjoy the ride. </p>

 <p> Memory is one of the best direct-to-video/b-movies I have ever seen. How a small production company gets a cast like this is beyond me, but this was just a great movie! Billy Zane is a guy with a clouded past, who decides to use an experimental drug to restore his memory. Only to vividly remember a murder he witnessed, but was it his memory or someone else's? I don't like Zane one bit, but in this movie, he's pure genius. What was really striking about this film, (especially since it's a low budget b-movie), was the imagery. Everything is so vibrate and methodically done. First time director, Bennett Davlin, really has you sitting on the edge of your seat. It really feels like you're alongside Zane, seeing what he sees. As for the ending, I never saw it coming. I've seen a lot of films, and you've got to have a pretty good story to surprise me! It's a film you've never heard of and won't see in theaters, but it's defiantly one that shouldn't be missed. </p>

 <p> Powerful performance by Billly Zane and an unusual role for Ann Margret- which she carried off with style & class. Original plot and great acting make it a must see psychological thriller movie. Not bloody or gory. Best of all it is a (A) movie so it doesn't need a lot of usless nudity to fill in the gaps in the plot. I was very pleased with my purchase. </p>
