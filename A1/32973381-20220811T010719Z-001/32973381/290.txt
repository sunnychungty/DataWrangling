 <p> After the death of his father, young Jim Hawkins takes over the running the Benbow Inn with his mother. One day an unexpected lodger, Captain Billy Bones, takes refuge there. He is located and handed the black spot the pirate sign of termination) by Blind Pew. While retrieving money owed he comes across a map. The adventure begins.There have many versions of this in movie form and plots lifted for other books. However, get ready here it comes, none are as good as the book; that being said this comes quite close with three hours they cut out less. They added some prequel information which helps set up the movie. You can tell that this is a TV movie as with all the guns and knives there was no excess gore.One of the DVD extras is a voice over commentary by Steve Barron the director and Eddie Izzard who played Long John.I am afraid that the Charlton Heston (1990) version will always be my favorite but this version is up there with the best.I have taken this story to hart so I have a tripod cat called Long John and a blind cat named Pew. </p>

 <p> It's long and it's good in plot but not perfect, in that it doesn't follow the book by Robert Louis Stevenson.  The costumes are not of the period of 1750 but rather that of 1812.  In the book Squire Trelawney was not the greedy English aristocrat depicted here, who cheats Jim Hawkins out of his fair share of the treasure.  This film also turns the character of Dr. Livesey into a sniveling wimp.  Granted, he was chatty and somewhat of an idiot in the book, but nothing like he is depicted in this film.  And Ben Gunn is rendered to a hopeless lunatic beyond saving and was rightly left behind on the island.  However in the book Ben Gunn still had his wits about him, thought rationally, and actually left the island with the rest and the treasure.  In this version, Jim Hawkins throws all of the treasure overboard with Square Trelawney diving into the sea after it and to his own demise.  The key to really appreciating this film is not to have read the book or to have seen the Charlton Heston (1990) film first.  Otherwise you will enjoy it, because the scenery is superb, and the acting very convincing. </p>

 <p> "Treasure Island" is one of those stories where reading the original novel beforehand is crucial to really savoring any film version, and this is especially true of this divergent adaptation. Although it retains the basic skeleton of the original plot, much has been added, and many key characters have undergone  fundamental changes. I was initially hostile to said changes but soon came to appreciate and enjoy the new sub-conflicts, many of which address universal themes (e.g., greed,loyalty) which are more relevant than ever today. I didn't particularly like the way "TI" (2012) hurries through pivotal scenes from the book, yet, with all that's been added, suppose that was necessary in order to limit its already 3-hour length.This version is also full of small anachronisms in clothing and hair design, as well as some bigger ones in the ethnically diverse ship's crew ("all Englishmen!" in the novel), some of whom sport Mr. T-style Mohawks (!?) While it seems the makers wanted to address the additional modern theme of diversity here, the un-pc truth of the matter is that your average European person of the 1700s would not have taken kindly to such a mix, and the way the crew, including its rich officers and financiers, blithely accept differences in nationality and skin-tones is, well, unconvincing. At the same time, there are also some added details (e.g., prostitutes, thieves, and hanged men along the filthy Bristol quayside) which, although avoided by Robert Louis Stevenson in a novel intended largely for a younger audience, add a great deal of realism in this version.In the end, "TI" (2012) is well-filmed and well-acted despite its various weak spots. While this revision is obviously to be avoided by those rigidly attached to the original story (or just wanting to see a film version of RLS's actual book), it should appeal to audiences in search of a less dualistic, more complicated tale, created in an age that tends to appreciate anti-heroes like Long John Silver. </p>

 <p> I was excited to see this, being a big fan of the book and the original movie version.  This one would seem to have all the elements: a faithful adaptation of a great story, and a good cast.  Yet it failed pretty dramatically in my view.  Why?  Mainly the trappings.It didn't "feel" like a pirate movie.  None of the cast acted like pirates.  It felt like it was shot in somebody's summer cabin rather than on a tropical island.  I didn't even buy it as a period piece, it seemed much more modern.  And then they made inexplicable changes to the characters.  The doctor is now a really pathetic coward (why?) And Jim is very duplicitous.  And instead of being a generally likeable bumbler, the Squire is now this evil schemer.  I don't understand, and certainly don't like the changes.Bah, well, hopefully somebody else will make another attempt. </p>

 <p> This is a charming, dramatic and splendid interpretation of Robert Louis Stevenson's 'Treasure Island'.I found the cast delightful and imaginative with dark, tough, superstitious, violent yet charismatic pirates and the lure of magical untold riches just around the bend. Eddie Izzard is perfectly cast as John Silver (he's a pirate I'd certainly follow) and the representatives of 'society and justice' are as cruel, violent and arbitrary as the pirates they fight against. There are no easy heroes or simple villains in this film. Full of charm and fine actors such as Rupert Penry Jones and Elijah Woods, this is a wonderful treat! </p>

 <p> I watched this with one of my grandsons - age 11. He loves adventure movies (and pirates), and was totally hooked on this mini series, although he commented that it seemed long. It was long because they took their time portraying the story as Robert Lewis Stevenson wrote it. I have always loved the story of Treasure Island, as well Kidnapped, another book by Robert Lewis Stevenson. I would definitely enjoy watching this version of Treasure Island again and recommend it to anyone else who loves the story.I also introduced my grandson to a movie about the story of Robinson Crusoe and he enjoyed that, as well. And, I loved getting him away from video games. </p>

 <p> I had virtually no interest in seeing yet another adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic "Treasure Island."  I could recite the story forward and backwards by heart, and I just didn't have the passion to sit down to this two-part version as recently broadcast on the SyFy network (thankfully, though, they didn't make it--just premiered it).  I relented, however, and was pleasantly surprised.  As with many film interpretations, this one does take liberties with the book's narrative.  If that's a huge issue for you, then you should probably just read the book again.  What it does present, though, is in keeping with the story's tone and makes for a solid stand-alone film.  An interesting cast and gorgeous location footage are among the highlights of this "Treasure Island," a dark and morally ambiguous vision.I was instantly attracted to the movie's skewed feverish look and thought things got off to a great start.  After introducing the cast of characters and getting them to sea, though, I felt like the momentum started to wane a bit.  For me, the first part was about 3 stars.  There were enough good elements, however, for me to stick around and the film got progressively stronger and more interesting in Part Two (which was easily 4 stars).  I'm not going to explain the plot in any detail, but a lot of the story is driven by the complex relationship between outlaw Long John Silver (Eddie Izzard) and young Jim Hawkins (Toby Regbo).  Sometimes allies, sometimes foes--these two form an unlikely and unexpected bond in which you never know exactly who's up to no good.  As the different parties race for the treasure, Jim is caught between.  Might Silver be more heroic than you first imagine?  May some of the Jim's excursion be more corruptible than he'd like?  The movie does a great job driving the paranoia on the island as everyone sinks into a madness brought on by desperation and greed.What really surprised me, however, and pushed this version over the edge is its cast.  Izzard really adds quite a bit of depth to Long John Silver.  I know some who objected to his casting, but it makes for a different interpretation.  Regbo does most of the heavy lifting dramatically and he's really up to the task.  I thought he was fantastic as the film's moral center.  A number of great British character actors fill out supporting roles including Rupert Penry-Jones, Daniel Mays, Philip Glenister (great as Captain Smollett), and Shirley Henderson.  Donald Sutherland has a brief cameo, and Elijah Wood has a change-of-pace role as Ben Gunn.  I didn't necessarily love Wood here (though I like him as an actor), but I found most every performance exemplary.  In the end, I found myself quite a supporter of the film.  It's not perfect, but it works as long as you aren't expecting an absolutely literal translation.  KGHarris, 5/12. </p>

 <p> Gone are the days when people would sit reading classic tales that had been handed down from generation to generation. Stories and books that were once required reading are now passed over for the more popular fare these days. That's sad in so many ways. Stories that once captured the imaginations of children are now ignored. The only way these stories come to life these days is when children see them in film or television format. That would be great except that children rarely seek out the original source and that film makers have a tendency to remake the original in their own mold. Such is the case here.TREASURE ISLAND is a fantastic book to read and author Robert Louis Stevenson wrote so well that the descriptions and story come alive when reading it. The book has been made into a film more than once, the most famous starring Wallace Beery in 1934 and Robert Newton in 1950. Both stuck to the story at hand and told of the adventures of young Jim Hawkins and the infamous pirate Long John Silver. This new production does the same but alters the tale a bit.Rather than start with the arrival of Billy Bones at the Inn Jim and his mother run, it starts with Capt. Flint and his treachery towards his crew only then returning to the original tale. Bones holes up in the Inn and tells Jim to let him know if he sees any sea faring man arrive. When one does, Bones knows his days are numbered. After he dies, Jim takes control of his possessions including a treasure map he finds. Seeking help from friend and local doctor Livesy, the pair unite with Squire Trelawney and set out in search of the hidden fortune.This is where a couple of major changes kick in. First off in the original story we had no idea who Silver was as he works his way into the adventure that these three plan only to reveal himself at a later time. Since he was in the opening sequences we know who he is and what he plans from the start. Secondly, the character of Squire Trelawney in the original was a benevolent person who wanted to help and share with Jim and the doctor. In this version he is an evil man who intends nothing of the sort but instead hopes to take control of the entire treasure once found leaving his companions nothing. This is a major change and feels wrong in every sense of the word.As the company prepares to sail Silver gets himself hired on as cook. When there seems to be a shortage of sailors to make the tide, he inserts members of his past crew in key positions to help him later take over the ship. None of this is apparent to Jim as he first enjoys the adventure he is on and later begins to think of forming a pact with Silver after Trelawney has told him and the doctor his intentions.Treachery is the name of the game here and eventually Silver and his men take over the ship once they get to the island. His position of captain of this pirate crew is called into question on more than one occasion, something else differing from the original book. As those that remain hole up in the abandoned fort left on the island, Silver and his men set out to take back the map and pilfer the treasure for themselves. Just who will walk away from the island with treasure in hand waits to be seen.With the popularity of the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN films it would seem that this would be a movie just waiting to be remade and apparently those in charge thought so as well. It's just too bad that like most storytellers these days remaking films they decided that it wasn't good enough on it's own merits and decided to change so much of it. Rather than rely on a book that was written so long ago and enjoyed by countless millions, it is turned into a story that barely resembles the original and fails due to the changes that are made. Film makers should learn to leave well enough alone when it comes to classics because they rarely make changes that work.One also has to wonder why it is that a movie at one time could tell an entire story in 90 minutes yet film makers today seem intent of shooting something that's no less than 2 hours and often times, as is the case her, up to 3 hours long. Perhaps it was so that this film could be a two evening event on television but for me it did nothing more than drag on. If TREASURE ISLAND is the movie you want to see then pass this one by. The only good thing it has to offer is Eddie Izzard as Silver. He does a tremendous job in the role. If only he had played the famous character instead of this one. </p>

 <p> "Treasure Island" is a classic of juvenile fiction. The hero is a young boy who takes on improbable challenges and invariably succeeds. He finds a treasure map, evades pirates, discovers a secret plot of mutineers, steals the boat single-handed, defeats the brutal ship's gunner in hand-to-hand combat, etc. etc. etc. It's a story for children, and I can't imagine that many people reading it in the 130+ years since it was originally published have thought "gosh, what this really needs is more brutality."I've seen the 1934, 1950, and 1990 film and television versions of this story. Each takes some liberties to fit its medium, and each of those versions has merit. This version, unfortunately, doesn't pay off. I don't recommend it. </p>

 <p> Movies about pirates are all the rage since Pirates of the Caribbean dominated the box office in the prior decade.  Some have been good, some have been bad.  Then there is this great miniseries from the SyFy channel starring various actor and actresses from both sides of the Atlantic.  Like other famous stories done up by the people at SyFy, this one is very impressive and original.  The story itself is similar to the original novel by Robert Louis Stevenson, and most of the characters in the book are present here.  But many changes were made, and for fans of the book, that might be quite disappointing.  However, for those interested in a good movie this one is quite enjoyable.  Part comedy, part action, part drama and part thriller, the movie does everything well.  The dialogue is spot on, with grammar and vocabulary matching those found in English language books from the late 1700s.  The make-up and costume design are very realistic, yet do not remind one of that found in the POTC movies.  The action scenes are good with realistic sword-fight scenes, accurate portrayals of fire-arms and fire-arm usage back then, and good but limited usage of special effects.  Even the music is good, with the sailors' songs being quite entertaining.  Overall, a great watching experience. </p>

 <p> When I started watching this It wasn't long before I took a lot of breaks to clean house or do laundry, then go back to viewing it. This version was very slow with poor acting. Although Elijah Wood stared in it, who is a good actor, I did not care for his character in this one. The other actors were slow to deliver as well. The fight scenes were also not well done either. I will stop there.In my opinion....I still like the one with Charlton Heston and Christian Bale. That version was excellent and I still have the VHS tape. </p>

 <p> This movie manages to happily ruin a great classic like Treasure Island.. and this in spite of a great cast that is just spot on for the role.. acting, attitude, atmosphere.. it's all right.. it's just the story that sucks, because .. yeah they changed it.they actually did feel the need to change it..and how? After all the suffering and deaths to find to treasure and when they are starting to sail back home Jim has the brilliant idea of throwing all the treasure overboard. Really great idea, so that it was all for nothing! But there's a high moral standard at stake here.. and I am afraid that it is "the poor and noble should remain noble, but above all he should remain poor". Very educative.  I' will let you figure out by yourself whose interests this "morality" serves... </p>

 <p> Like what you like or not, all this crying over changes made to Stevenson's original novel make no sense whatever. Every film ever made based upon an existing piece of work was by nature someone's interpretation of that work, not a word-for-word presentation of it. The Disney film 'Treasure Island' reflected the style & vision of its makers & was aimed toward the audiences of its time; as was the far, far superior 90s version done by the Hestons. Even screenplays written by the authors of original stories differ in parts from the book. Read Hemingway's "To Have & Have Not" then see the movie written by William Faulkner; other than certain character names they bear almost no resemblance, but are both masterpieces. Somebody find me a movie that matches exactly its source material (maybe 'No Country For Old Men' is the closest & the best) with no variation at all; it's nearly impossible. I agree that remakes have gotten out of hand & you can quickly count up the ones that are actually better than the original rather than just an updated re-hash but, then again, what would be the point of making a shot-for-shot, word-for-word copy of something already done? If someone were to publish a new book titled 'Treasure Island' sticking to the same basic storyline, just changing some of the particulars, that would be one thing but, this is a movie adaptation & a little fresh imagination & a new point of view is not a bad thing. As far as this film goes: When I first saw Eddie Izzard cast as Silver I thought, "What the hell?" & moved on along without a second look. Then I saw part of the movie on Netflix & realized how wrong I was. While not the traditional character at all, his portrayal of Long John Silver is fascinating & much fuller than most & in some ways(BLASPHEMY) I prefer him to the old version. The characters here seem more like real people than costume pieces despite the odd haircuts, etc, & may even be closer to the reality of what they represent than any even in Stevenson's book. One example being the old benevolent Squire Trelawney, so genuine & caring about the welfare of the men 'under' him. The landed gentry of the 18th century were no more like that than are the upper crust of today (politicians, corporate heads, etc), this film's makers just chose to portray that fact. Good for them. </p>

 <p> "I will plan a venture Jim Hawkins and we will both profit wildly. Trust me boy." After Long John Silver (Izzard) is double crossed by his captain Flint (Sutherland) he only has one thing on his mind. Retreiving the treasure he feels is rightly his. When finding out that the only one who can get a ship to the island where the treasure is is a young boy named Jim Hawkins (Regbo) he makes friends with him. I have never seen any of the other versions of this nor read the book. I knew a little of the story but to me this was about 90% new to me. Even though this is a made for TV movie it is much better then most of the theater movies that have been released recently. Izzard is a perfect choice for this and I think is on par with Depp. This movie is very entertaining and I recommend it. This is a pirate movie that can stand side by side with the first "Pirates Of The Carribbean" movie, and may actually be better in some ways. This is a movie well worth your time. Overall, best pirate movie since the original Pirates. I enjoyed it. I say B+. </p>
