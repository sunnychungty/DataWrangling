 <p> I travel weekly via plane, and have had some sort of PDA /MP3 type device since 2000.  I started with Creative's Nomad Jukebox, 40 gig, CD PLayer sized device at about 10 oz., and for the last few years have had a Creative Zen X-tra 30 gig.  I'm a bit older, and frankly am tired of looking at a microscopic LCD screen, that you can hardly see.  Also Album Art is important to me, because frequently if I see an Album I'm interested in, I can't remember sometimes if I have it or not by looking at the song, as much as the graphic; also Titles like #1's, and Greatest Hits all start looking the same.  There's psychology for me in being able to look at the Album Cover!From what I read folks buy the Archos for video playing and recording, not primarily for MP3s; and not for carrying while jogging.  I bought it after reading all the other reviews primarily to hold my MP3 collection on a bright screen and display album art.First of all I've used it now about 3 weeks and the device is flawless!!!  I spent easily 30 hours though re-organizing my MP3 album collection, cleaning up duplicates, re-ripping CD's that software applied the wrong tags too, or put in Unknown albums.  I bought Tag and Rename online to help me do this; and in cases where it couldn't find album art, I did a google search and found jpeg covers, saved them and added them to the tags.I tried to load my newly cleaned-up collection to my Zen Xtra and found that WindowsMediaPlayer10, created duplicate libraries.  Afraid to corrupt my Archos, I transferred the library manually to the Archos putting it in HardDrive mode.  Since doing this I have grown to love HradDrive mode to manage the data on the Archos and my laptop and home PCs.  It is so easy to drag and drop and don't have to worry about synch issues.  I even talked to Archos Tech support, and the rep I talked to said he doesn't use Windows Media Player to synch, does it manual too.As one reviewer wrote the navigation buttons are not quite intuitive; but after about 2 weeks of working with the Archos, I really appreciate their set-up over any other device I've worked with.  The bookmark function is great, and the resume feature I love.  The audio quality is right up there with Creative's; and the screen is awesome.  The overall quality of the hardware is a good 4 stars, 5 stars would be something really rugged for me.The little tiny speaker that plays music is not great, but not bad to let you hear something in a pinch; like test a song, etc, or listen to a movie privately.  I use either Sennheiser headphones or Bose.When the track plays, it displays the album art, but not as you page through the music list.  But at least I can find the cover and get to know what I have.Now video.  I told you already I bought this to be a great MP3 player, not video; but anything I got with video for me was a bonus.  Well I didn't realize that as a Personal Video Recorder it will record video, right from a source.  But for me with travelling, I don't want to have to carry another device, open my laptop in a tiny airline seat, or worry about my battery dying.  Also I didn't want to take the time to record a DVD from a DVD player to play on the Archos.  For me it's easier to rip a video if I could.  I don't condone illegal sharing, but making a copy for myself, of movies that if they weren't portable, I'd never find time to watch; is legal as far as I'm concerned.  While Archos won't sell or support this, I bought an IM TOO DVD ripper package on the web, and am trialing DVDIdle's CSS and Region free.  I have successfully ripped about 4 movies, including Chronicles of Narnia.  There's some slight choppiness in the ripped movies, which are probably a techinical issue, because they are slightly choppy or hesitate a tiny bit, on my laptop ripped or the Archos, unrelated to the Archos.  But not enough to really effect playability.  Anyway the movies for me are AWESOME on the ARCHOS.  Picture quality is bright, audio is great; and action flows nice except for what I noted.  The side angle viewing is not bad.  The device performs really well; is very pleasing to work with and operate.  I'm considering buying an extended warranty in the next week.  I've had some of these warranties before for other products, and if you ever get a ding on the device, they probbably won't repair it, because they'll say you caused the damage; even when you didn't.  But for 29.99 for 2 years I think it's worth a shot.  Archos Tech support said they get calls about the devices freezing-up, but then those are the only calls they get? so how many really do? They told me to keep the unit backed-up so if I have to re-format I could.Also, as you can use the device USB Media Player or as a USB hard drive; Archos is very specific about telling you that if you have it in USB mode, you can "just" disconnect it; but if it's hard drive mode, do a safely remove hardware in windows before disconnecting.  Well because I have it plugged into the USB port, I forgot several times, and pulled it out, in hard drive mode w/o doing the safely remove.  So I taped a tiny note right on the USB plug, and was able to break the USB pull habit, and have always done the safely remove.  As I said I just love the convenience on any computer recognizing this as a HardDrive.  I've just started putting photos on it, and some personal movies, and getting all this in one small device; makes this worth it.  This is certainly an expensive item, but for weekly travel and portability, and being able to see a screen!!!, it's nice home away from home! </p>

 <p> I got one for my daughter about 10 months ago for photo storage while traveling.  It worked just great until 2 days before she had to fly to Italy.  Photo download is almost automatic if using a flash card reader and a mini-USB plug.  I ended up getting an Archos 604 wifi for her trip ( a really neat unit but everything is extra- no built-in mini-USBs, no A/V jacks, no AC charger, but a trippy touchscreen and 30GB is a LOT of room= about 1000 photos + 400 songs + 12 movies, and still less than 1/3 full), while sending the AV500 in for warranty repair. The AV500 had a squashed 100GB drive from a swollen THICK battery- stay away from these batteries. ONLY Archos can replace the hard drives- has to do with HDD/firmware serial numbers.  I just got it back after 2 weeks and the drive was replaced with a 120GB drive, but the right button worked intermittently (I opened it up and cleaned the contacts on the circuit (film) board = now OK.  DO NOT do this if you have any warranty left- send it in.  There are plenty of horror stories about warranty work quality, but they did right by me- this time!  Video quality is perfect for me- great contrast, good resolution for my dvdfa3 480x272 vob-avi converted files.  Audio playback/volume is outstanding (for me).  The one tiny speaker is a joke.I haven't tried any video camera recording, so can't say yea or nay. I like it!  It's a little bit thicker than the new Archos stuff, but you get everything in one small box! </p>

 <p> This is a FUN little device and blows ipod out of the pool. Take time to read the very well written manual and you will be glad you bought it. (Those with complaints obviously haven't read it.) The easiest way to transfer dvd's to it is in real time and hey ! you feel the quality is not up to dvd standards ? Simply change the bit rate to a higher number and your eyes will pop !Doing it with the computer takes a learning curve. Its not that bad and music transfer is easy.The higher bit rate takes up more space so get the 100GB model. Imagine having your entire dvd and cd and photo collection on one device ! Once again, READ THE MANUAL. It's well written by any standard. Enjoy !! </p>

 <p> I expect a lot out of a high tech toy -- and this thing grabbed me right out of the box. I waited a couple months before reviewing - to be sure there weren't any hidden issues.For many long plane flights I wanted to bring  selected TV shows from my Media Center PC DVR. This syncs without a hitch using Windows Media Player 10 (the only hitch, perhaps, is that you have to find the folder where Media Center stores video and drag and drop files from there -- quite easy). The file compression for the device is handled automatically.Video quality is superb - just the right size for personal viewing.  Way easier than hauling out the laptop on a plane or anywhere else.I found it easy to record whole DVDs to it as well - they also get automattically compressed, but with excellent image and audio on playback.An unexpected bonus for me is the built mics for stereo audio recording.  The quality is great and I find I'm using that feature quite a bit.It looks and feels solid and I've had nothing but good luck with mine so far. </p>

 <p> Love it - after a couple months solid use </p>

 <p> So far the Av500 is a winner for me only in that it has morethan triple the harddrive space than my Av400 has. I don'tlike that it's more bulkier and the button pad is not fingerfriendly. list.  Sometimes it shows up and sometimes I cannot find out how to bring it up.  The little speaker is so useless. It has a very tiny sound. The Av400 was just as bad but at least you could hear content clearly. On the bright side, the screen size is nice and it does support a basic wmv format along with Avi's which is an improvement over the AVI limited Av400.  So all n all, get this to store lots of content and then get a Cowon A2 too. Also stay tuned for the Av505 which supposedly will have a bigger harddrive version of 160 gb and better button/navigation interface. There's no PMP that is a slam dunk winner. They all have flaws and strengths. Enjoy! </p>

 <p> UpdateThe new firmware update solved all the previously mentioned problems , Since then , the device is great , I'm increasing my rate to excellent after more than a year of useReally a very handy Device ,Great in play back all kind of Riped movies ,Especially after using the PC translator on the included CD.In my opinion the DVR is the Future ,But of course Archos still need  to do some work on it, I get a lot of Error messages during recording witch resulted in losing many chances to record things I want ,I contacted the Customer Support and they told me to run the window Scan disk & Defrag .The Defrag takes a round 3 hours on the 100GB model if you are using 50% of the HD capacity.I just had one right now & while I wright this review the AV500 is connected to the PC & Norton Scan disk is running on it & this is another 2 hours .Matter of Fact Every time I get the Error Message from the recording module the HD Defrag & Scan disk solves it , I got it more 4 times till now , It's really annoying.The MP3 is Fantastic Especially the Super Bass Slider , You can get a Real Great sound but not with the included Headphone , Get the Koss KTXPRO1 Titanium Portable Headphones with Volume Control .Final ConclusionThis is a Great Device But with an Error that takes 5 hours of HD maintenance , BUT it works Every time ( Till Now). </p>

 <p> My first review was way too long, so I scrapped it and I'm starting over. I'll try to be brief because if I'm not, no one will ever read this and then what's the point?GOOD:* The screen is awesome. Resolution is stunning and brightness is perfect. Maybe it'll suck outdoors, but if I'm outdoors, I shouldn't be watching TV anyway. =)* The file navigation rocks. It maintains all the same subfolder I've created over the years, and I love that. Dragging and dropping files as if it were nothing more than an external hard drive is brilliant, plain and simple.* Build quality seems solid and strong through-out.BAD:* The audio quality (out the earphone jack) is acceptable at best. With headphones, an FM transmitter or a tape adapter, I don't imagine its shortcomings would be noticable. However, in a side-by-side comparison with my iPod, Dell notebook, and XBox, all playing the exact same MP3 through the exact same stereo (Pink Floyd - Sheep - 320kbps, Yamaha 7.1 receiver, Sapphire STII speakers), the Archos sounded noticably and frustratingly flatter than all the others. Thankfully I had no intentions of using this device at home, because if I did, it'd be back in the box, re-shrink-wrapped and on a shelf somewhere far, far away from me.* While attached as a USB device, the battery doesn't recharge, even though 2.0 would support this. As if that wasn't bad enough, the LCD doesn't even turn off, so basically it's draining battery power as quickly as possible now. Ridiculous.VERDICT:Awesome-ness of the screen trumps all. This is a video device, after all. </p>

 <p> I've had this player for almost 1 month. I've tried all the functions except recording and here are my impressions.Positive Points:- Superb, and I really mean it, superb screen. I've compared it against friends with Ipod (too small screen) and creative Zen Vision (not so sharp and bright)- Very good sound for this kind of device- Enough space for all my music (50Gb), and also to carry plenty of movies and store my photos.- Easy to use interface for basic functions.- Very easy to transfer music and videos using Windows Media Player- Easy connection to TV to view movies stored in the unit with excellent quality (of course depending of the compression used for the movie itself). Note that the docking station IS NOT required to connect it to the TV to watch movies(another reviewer wrongly complained about this)- Absolute value for moneyNot so positive points:- Access to advanced functions (secondary menu) not very intuitive.- The auto setting for screen size does not work very weel. It will always expand the picture to fill the viewing area this results in losing part of the picture with movies in wide-screen format. It can be solved by selecting "original format" but it is irritating, given that most of the movies today are in WS format.- it has a "bookmark" function that can be used with any file to mark important points. Generally this is would be a great feature to go back to wherever you stopped playing, however since no name can be given to the bookmark, it is impossible to go back to it unless you remember the exact file you were listening to, and to go back to it you'll have to scroll through all files in the list. Imagine you set the bookmark and stop, lets say , on file number 250 of a list containing several hundred.. then you go and watch a movie or whatever (there's a resume function but only goes back to the item currently played, the movie in this case) and try after that to go back to the mp3 you were listening to... good luck.- When charging the unit there's no indicator to show how much has already been charged.Overall I'm extremely pleased with this device. </p>

 <p> This video device has a good screen resolution, not excellent, and an acceptable user interface.  My first one did not record video and it took five hours with tech support at Archos to finally convince them it was the player and not me.  They promised a replacement unit within three days which never was shipped.  After two weeks of promises I gave up, however Amazon was wonderful and had me a replacement unit in two days without any shipping charges and this unit worked as promised.Tech support at Archos is virtually non-existent.  Given the state of the art of portable video recording devices and formats supported, this is among the leaders, but I think the screen resolution in models coming out in the next year will improve, as will the interface.  There are slightly too many buttons to push in order to pull up screens to record, erase, file, rename a file, all of which can be a little burdensome.  This can clearly be improved upon.I would not hesitate to buy this again EXCEPT for the reason that Archos gives virtually no tech support and does not fulfill on their promises of replacement units.  Since tech support is very important to me, that becomes the deal breaker in my case.  Of note, I am not technically incompetent, I am the head of IT for a major medical center, hence I can solve most technical issues on my own.  Most consumers will fault technical support departments long before I will, so Archos, in my opinion, has a long way to go in that area. </p>

 <p> I PURCHASED THIS PVR ABOUT 2 MONTHS AGO , SO FAR I HAVE BEEN VERY SATISFIED WITH IT, MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS WHY NOT THIS PVR NOT HAVING A FM TUNER ON IT,  \\\? IT IS WELL MADE, AND I AM HAPPY WITH IT, THE BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD TOO, I LISTED TO MY SONGS  FOR ABOUT 4 HOURS AND STILL HAD ABOUT HALF JUICE LEFT IN IT. GOOD LUCK, BUY IT , AND ENJOY IT.WELL, I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT I PURCHASED THE EXTENDED BATTERY FOR IT SO IT IS ABOUT TWICE HAS LIFE IN IT. </p>

 <p> I finally decided to get an MP3 player because I was getting tired of searching for and loading CDs in my car's changer.  I wanted as much storage capacity as possible so I could keep my entire music library in my car, which is the only place I listen to music.My research led me to the 60 GB Ipod and then I found the Archos.  Not only does it have more space (100 GB), but a bigger screen (but it is also bigger and heavier than the Ipod.)  However, now I could use the Archos to store my daughter's videos for trips and ditch the heavy DVD player and discs.  Plus it has a built in speaker, which is necessary since my daughter refuses to use earphones.Transfering files from Windows XP is easy.  Video transfer is as simple as plugging the Archos into a DVD player and recording as the DVD is played.  A more complicated approach is to rip the DVD on a PC and recode using MPEG-4.  For car/travel the Archos is great.  For those who need a player while jogging/biking, something smaller without all the video functions might be a better choice. </p>

 <p> I really enjoyed this product but one morning it wasn't working and I noticed the battery had puffed out about 20% and the back could not close. I had it for about one year when this happened. The other problem is some formats are not compatible so you have to convert them, which is a real pain in the B. </p>
