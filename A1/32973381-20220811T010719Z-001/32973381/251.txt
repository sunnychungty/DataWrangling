<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> For the uninitiated, the films of Jean Rollin can be hard to explain (and sometimes, even harder to defend).  The Iron Rose was the 3rd in a series of borderline horror/erotica films the director made in the 70's.  For those looking for cheap thrills, this probably isn't the Rollin film you want.  Unlike the "lesbian vampire" sub-genre Rollin help to perpetuate with films likeShiver of the Vampires [Blu-ray] andLips of Blood [Blu-ray], The Iron Rose is actually fairly restrained.It's a fairly simple story of a young couple who get locked in a cemetary at night, and the rapid disintegration of their relationship and sanity.  The girl (neither character is given a name in the film) is affected the most, as she begins to embrace the death and decay surrounding them, to the point of even talking to corpses beneath their feet.  In the wrong hands, such scenes might have decended into camp, but Rollin gets a bravura performance out of Francoise Pascal.  She takes the girl from kittenish flirt to screaming lunatic in a matter of minutes.As with most any foreign "art" film, one can look for something beneath the surface if one enjoys that type of celluloid psychoanalysis.  The girl, for example, may be taking on her shocking new hobby out of disappointment in her would-be lover (who unfortunately resembles the French love child of Rob Lowe and Eric McCormack).  If that sounds far-fetched, consider this exchange early in the film:  As the pair settle in for a picnic beside a tombstone, the boy accidentally knocks over an iron cross marker.  As he's replacing it, the girl comments "Is doesn't seem very hard."  "Hang on, I'll stick it back in," he replies.  Hello...paging Dr. Freud!Even putting aside the search for meaning in a 40 year-old French exploitation film, it's not hard to appreciate the gorgeous cinematography.  This was my first time viewing the film, so I can't compare the transfer to any prior release, but the colors are quite vivid.  Even the numerous nighttime scenes--often a place where HD transfers falter--are clear enough without seeming articially lit.  Shots are composed for maximum beauty, such as the famous beach scene, where the girl imagines covorting nude with the titular iron rose in-hand.  Like other auteurs such as Hitchcock or Argento, Jean Rollin seems to believe in the power of what Hitch called "pure cinema."  The plot and actors are never as important as what the camera's eye actually sees at any given moment.As for the Blu-ray, the extras include interviews with Rollin himself, Pascal, and a frequent collaborator of the director.  There are great, unedited trailers for this and four additional Rollin films.  As mentioned above, the transfer is rich in color and detail.  While it's not quite up to today's HD standards, it's perfectly fine for a film of this vintage.  There's a handy little booklet written by Tim Lucas which covers all of Jean Rollin's films (for those who have bought other Rollin titles from Redemption, this is the same book that comes with those).If you've heard about Rollin and wanted to give him a try. . .I'd actually suggest you start with Shiver of the Vampires or his most popular filmFascination.  But if you like atmosphere and suggestive horror, The Iron Rose is a good choice as well. </p>

 <p> This movie has possibilities but it was slow moving and poorly executed...  Ideas and possibilities are left hanging ..  It is not clear if the director really wanted to say something or just churn out another gallows humor work... It could have been a great movie focused on the challenge of people who are obsessed with a death wish. </p>

 <p> In THE IRON ROSE, a man and woman meet at a wedding reception, go for a bike ride, and wind up at a cemetery. They decide to have sex in a crypt (!!), and stay until sundown. The couple finds themselves trapped, unable to find a way out. Increasing panic ensues, as they spiral downward into insanity. Death, the fear thereof, and superstitious dread are explored. One of Jean Rollin's more subtle efforts. Contains far less nudity, and far more philosophical discussion than the typical Rollin horror film. The scene where the young lovers roll around in human bones is unsettling, and what's up w/ that clown, anyway?... </p>

 <p> "The Iron Rose"(1972) is directed by Jean Rollin. Most of the film takes place in a cemetery where a boy and girl spend the night. The film is relatively simple, but is beautifully photographed from the early scenes in a foggy train yard, to the sumptuous richness of colour in the overgrown cemetery, to the stark, dream-like beach scenes. The film is a tone poem about youth, love, exploration, nostalgia, superstition, madness, and death. This is easily one of my favourite films by Jean Rollin as it highlights his mastery of colour and direction.The blu-ray doesn't appear to be remastered and has many instances of dust, but I didn't notice this once the film got well under way. There are several special features, including a brief interview with Jean Rollin, a 22 minute interview in HD with the lead actress, Francois Pascal, and a 7 minute interview with the assistant and actress Natalie Perrey. There is also a 20 page booklet with an essay by Tim Lucas, editor of video watchdog. </p>

 <p> Jean Rollin made some classic films, but this is not one of them. A vapid and narcissistic guy leads  the female lead through a series of bad experiences, to (I suppose) understand how dismal life would be...if he were not at the center of it....as his wife/ lover/ accomplice. I am SO TIRED of French and Italian films telling me what great lovers they are. I have been to France, but not Italy...but I find this whole concept very hard to embrace. The narcissistic attitude on display is not only false, but very dismaying to any female with an I.Q. above..say 50! What is it with Mediterranean men? American men (who have equally bizarre ideas about sex and gender) can learn NOTHING from watching this film..except how to avoid another heart-wrending episode in their life. Buy a vibrator....it's ( by far) more dependable! </p>

 <p> What a dud. I'm afraid I have to disagree with the other reviewers here, all of whom so far gave this film three-, four-, and five-star reviews. Despite the fact that the movie lasts less than 90 minutes, it seems to take forever. A young couple spends the day in a cemetary mostly making love (and mostly off camera), and when night falls they can't find their way out. Certainly an intriguing set-up,  except all they do is they wander around the cemetary looking for the exit...and wander...and wander some more...and yell at each other a bit...and wander some more. There is no stalker or even the hint of one. And just when you think the movie might finally be over you check the counter on your DVD player and find there is still another 20 minutes! And since the movie has no point at all anyway, why not have a scene where a man in a clown outfit lays flowers at one of the graves, just to waste some more time. Instead of renting this movie, why not just watch some paint dry. </p>

 <p> I've seen some bad movies before, but this one takes the cake.  This one ranks side by side with 'The Wolf of Briar County' (or something like that).  I thought I would never see a movie as bad as that one, but alas....'The Iron Rose' comes along.  I have totally wasted an hour of my time.  Finally, I had to just skip through.  Never have I EVER been so elated to see two weirdos exit a movie, alive or dead, especially that silly HORRIBLE actress who played the girlfriend..  Gosh, this movie was HORRIBLE! I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy......no wait...yes, I would.  One sure way of getting revenge on your worst enemy is to tell them that 'The Iron Rose' is a must see......bwahaha!  THUMBS WAY DOWN! </p>

 <p> One of the best film to Blu Ray transfers I've ever seen! No cracks or pops, yet still retains that &#34;Film&#34; look. If you are new to Jean Rollins' work, start here! Even though it's mid career this is his best and most accessible work. </p>

 <p> Cinematic transfer. </p>

 <p> Simplicity is the bff of suspense, in modern cinema there seems to be a need to over complicate things to such a point that most suspense is lost in thrillers and horror films, replaced by action, which is the opponent of suspense. Something doesn't have to reach out and grab you to be scary, it's the thought that something could reach out and grab you that is. "The Iron Rose" is an obscure French fright film that understands this.Made in 1973 by the late Jean Rollin, he of many a soft core lesbian vampire flick, here delivers an artful work of atmosphere and dread. Based on a poem by the French poet Tristan Coliere, this simple story follows two young lovers, not even name in the film, who find themselves locked into a cemetery over night. A frightful thought for sure, but it's in how the characters react to their situation and surroundings that make for an interesting and unsettling film. The ending is both tragic and poetic, maybe a little pretentious. The film does drag a little towards the end, and at just over 80 minutes it does feel a little padded.Still, this is an interesting work, one of the best by Rollin, who had a real flair for art in horror, but was bogged down by his exorbitant interest in naked vampires and sex scenes, though, they too were very well filmed. I saw this first on Turner Classic Movies' TCM Underground, where I first expected this too be an unusual fit for the well respected cable network, I found that this fit in quiet nicely with their classy programming. I'm not fully sure what audience will react best to this unqiue film, but adventures horror fans and European art fans should have common ground with this rare gem. </p>

 <p> While out riding bicycles in the country, a young couple on their first date stop to picnic in a vast cemetery. They soon find themselves in the throes of passion in one of the crypts below ground. When they emerge, the already uneasy lovers discover night has fallen, and they are now lost amongst the graves. As the night progresses, the seemingly endless cemetery takes on a more ominous tone as the lovers panic and turn on each other as they try in vain to find a way out. Before the break of dawn the girl becomes consumed by her surroundings, rejects the outside world, and wishes to remain with the dead. By contrast her companion becomes more hostile as he searches in vain for a way out.There's more to THE IRON ROSE than that, but not much more in terms of plot. It literally is a night in the cemetery. Director, Rollin does an admirable job of infusing the surroundings with a somber dread as we share what feels like a real-time descent into dusk and the overwhelming spell cast by the  iron crosses, crumbling statues, and overgrown maze of tombs in which the lovers are trapped. Indeed, to enjoy this film you pretty much have to share Rollin's fascination for the morbid aesthetics of the  authentic cemetery in which he filmed.I'm not a huge Rollin fan but I liked THE IRON ROSE quite a bit. It would be more than fair to say it's not for everyone. It's certainly not "horror" in the conventional sense. Rather, it's an artsy, grim bit of  romantic poetry that chooses death over love as its inspiration. Sound pretentious? Well, it is, but it also just kind of worked for me.This new HD transfer is a great improvement over the previous DVD. The image is more nuanced than before, and gives the film a more natural looking nighttime appearance. </p>

 <p> A tip of the hat to Redemption for releasing this rare Rollin film to his fans and to people who like their horrors simplistic and passionate.  This is an interesting nightmare involving two lovers locked overnight in a  cemetary and having their imaginations, senses, and friendships dissolving around them.  Shadows reveal terror, gothic statuary reveals monsters, iron gates become invisible claws, I could go on and on but experience it for yourself preferably after midnight. </p>
