 <p> The all time best hispanic comedy (in english that is) I could not recomend anything less than five stars on this one. So many little "inside jokes" for those who know anything about the mexican culture. I love this movie.  My one and only complaint is that the entire version of the movie is yet to be released, even in the new DVD of 2003, the movie is incomplete.  That my friends is unacceptable! </p>

 <p> This version of the film on DVD is better than the one from goodtimes productions. Yet both versions on DVDs are very edited from the original version. The film is a little longer, on scene in particular is the marriage scene at the end, how else did Rudy end up in a float at the parade, and that is just one major one. This DVD is good, but the old VHS version seems more &quot;complete.&quot; I only wish Cheech had the support to create other such films! </p>

 <p> I picked "Born in East L. A." off the bargain DVD racks at a discount store. I thought it was a Cheech and Chong movie, but it was a Cheech Marin movie only. That's OK, it was a good movie and we enjoyed it. The story involves an American of latino descent getting picked up as an illegal alien and deported to Mexico and his troubles in getting back into the country. It's funny, as you might expect, but it's also a somewhat touching drama and makes for engaging viewing. The movie is about 30 years old, but seems fresh and new and in tune with all the modern headlines. It's an interesting movie. Well done.Gary Peterson </p>

 <p> Great movie,  I dont know why the studios ended it like this,  I have an old VHS copy where at the end they come back to the East side and are kidnapped by the people who are renting a house across the street from where Rudy's family lives....whats up with that, I feel robbed, they should of at least put that in a deleted scenes option. </p>

 <p> Despite the hysteria about illegal and undocumneted aliens today, and the crazy open borders policy that the corrupt cheap labor big biz repubs and wacko lefty dem pols who only want the extra votes this movie is excellent. It looks at at immigration as, well you would expect Cheech and Chong to look at the problem. This is a very very funny movie. Cheech is a riot. The movie is both very hilairous, sweet and humanizing. This may be my favorite Cheech and Chong film! I say the at the movies years ago, and on rented VHS tape a few times since then. I still love seeing this film. I love the sexy redhead played by Neith Hunter in the begining. She was once Richard Gere's girlfriend. She really has very little to do with the film plot, but it is a very nice switch and bate just the same. I highly recommend this film, for it is about coming to America. All of us came as immigrants at one time or another and we are ALL AMERICANS IF WE WANT TO BE! It does not matter if you just fell off the boat or came over the bearing striats with the Amerindians 20 thousand years ago. As Neal Diamond wounld say "Were Coming to America". </p>

 <p> Hispanic-American Rudy (Cheech Marin) is just having a fine day until an immigration raid as he's wrongfully prosecuted as an illegal immigrant. He doesn't know a word of spanish and forgot to bring his wallet and ID, he's forced to be deported to Mexico as he must find a way to get back to the U.S. even if he has to work for a club owner (Daniel Stern) for money.Entertaining, underrated and hilarious cult comedy written and directed by Cheech Marin in based on his comedy parody album of the same name. Co-starring Paul Rodriguez, this lighthearted comedy has good laughs and an original storyline from Marin fresh off his Cheech and Chong stuff, this is one of the best and funniest comedy movies i've ever seen for i highly recommend it.The DVD here has good picture and sound with both fullscreen and widescreen versions and one extra which is the theatrical trailer. </p>

 <p> I am a fan of both Cheech Marin & Thamas Chong, Cheech is good at playing both Cheech or Red, but this aint no Cheech & Chong flick!  Born In East L.A., is a movie about an Los Angeles Native Ruby, who is a Chicano, One day a Border Patroller asked Ruby for his Green Card, but Ruby didn't own no Green Card, because he was born & raised in East Los Angeles, CA.  Ruby is taken on a truck with a dozen other illegal immigrants, and is taken to Tijuana, Mexico in which Ruby has to learn to survive and know how to speak spanish, if he's left out on the streets of Tijuana.  I don't wanna spoil the movie for anyone so just go out and watch the damn film if you are a fan of Cheech Marin and his acting, this movie is 1 Loco Thrill ride aswell! </p>

 <p> What made this film funny is that Cheech Marin's character Rudy Ramos tried to behave as the straight guy while acting out just about every bad Mexican joke that's ever been told. In this respect, it's one gaffe right after another.BTW I also got a big kick out of Paul Rodriguez as the cousin, Javier, who acted like the picture of Jesus with the phone behind it was talking to him... at one point, he obediently brings "Jesus" a can of beer, LOL!If only the real situation were not so depressing. I went to Tijuana in December '88 with a buddy who's an American citizen (he's of Mexican descent, but looks Egyptian... so the border guards never gave him any trouble), and came back across at the end of the day wondering why any sane person would want to live there. As bad as Tijuana is, however, I've heard it's nowhere near as bad as Calcutta ( =Tijuana if it was hit by a bomb). </p>

 <p> In my humble opinion, 'Born In East L. A.' is a decent comedy. Things start to happen when Los Angeles native Rudy Robles (Cheech Marin - also directed the film) is sadly mistaken for an illegal alien. So the authorities try to have him deported back to Mexico. Robles makes the attempt to contact his family - but his non-English speaking cousin Javier (Paul Rodriguez) simply cannot help him. There are a good number of memorable (as well) as amusing scenes through out this movie. Perhaps not Cheech Marin's best work - but definitely worth pulling out of your DVD collection for a view when you're in the mood. Big-time / old school Cheech & Chong fans will undoubtedly enjoy this flick very much so. </p>

 <p> Delightful with a twist here and there that keeps this classic within the top bracket. A relative from Mexico visits his cousins in L.A. but what happens when he is to be picked up at the destination everything goes wrong. Border crossing are a go at that time and there is plenty of action and amusement with this show, plus the antics are full on from beginning to end. Marvelous storyline with a fabulous cast to make it first class. I rated this movie an A grade plus for a fantastic piece of entertainment that will have you in fits of laughter. So that is all I can say as not to spoil it for you. I have not seen anything like it and its completely different to all other shows. Now all you have got to do is gather up the popcorn get comfortable with your feet up, relax to something very special on your night of at the movies, with great entertainment and enjoy. </p>

 <p> Per what I've read, this version cut out the wedding at the end. Wedding? Only 1 evening together with him sleeping it off? Losing a wallet can happen to anyone but most of this picturewas too unrealistic. I love Tijuana, I traveled across the border many times and was questioned about my nationality during visits there. This movie doesn't come close to Marin's acting capabilities; on TV, there was Golden Girls and Nash Bridges; in addition to the Cheech and Chong movies and Desperado. Want to see Cheech Marin act? See "Up in Smoke." </p>

 <p> Give us your tired and poor but keep Cheech Marin. Cheech Marin writes, directs and stars in Born in East L.A., a hip, outrageous comedy that's based on his best-selling record parody.The story follows Rudy (Marin), an American of Hispanic descent, whose south-of-the-border looks show him no mercy during an immigration raid in a migrant worker factory.As his luck goes, he is caught with neither money nor his ID and is deported to Mexico - without speaking a word of Spanish! Unable to contact his vacationing family or his newly immigrated cousin (Paul Rodriguez), Rudy is in for a crazy ride as he tries every legal - and illegal - scheme he can think of to get back home to the States. He finds himself in jail, in love, and practically in-sane! Trouble follows him everywhere as he runs from la migra in this case of mistaken - or rather misplaced - identity.This comedy flick takes me back to memory lane to when I was 14 going on 15 years old in my Freshmen year in high school during its theatrical release in the Summer of 1987. </p>

 <p> Bought this as a follow-up to Whoopee Boys, which I also ordered through Amazon. I know this movie isn't intended for 10-12 year olds, but I get a kick out of seeing my kids laugh their butts off just as I did when I was their age. Besides theres a whole line-up of trash on tv and online which makes this movie the most wholesome choice. </p>
