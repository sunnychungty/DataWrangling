 <p> As the person before me I read the first book for free and enjoyed it immensely. I got the second one and couldn't put it down.  Now I cant wait for the third one to see what happens to the characters! </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Little long, but still loved it! </p>

 <p> I like that the two main characters don't exactly have a happy ever after. It adds depth to the story. The author was able to show shades of grey in her bad guys too. That's a plus in books. It was worth the money to buy this book and I will also purchase book three when it comes out. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> I like it </p>

 <p> The style continues to be excellent in book #2. The phrasing, structure, word choice, etc., makes it comfortable to read.My challenge with book #2 is the number of sub stories going on. There are so many concurrent sub plots that I found myself jumping ahead (which I almost never do). The flashbacks of Lucifer I found distracting and not contributing as much overall as I expect the writer(s) expected. I have a feel for the characters, their roles, their contributions, etc., and maybe all this background will become more useful/valuable in future books.Will I purchase book #3? Yes.Did I enjoy it? YesNote: There are multiple descriptions of sexual interactions which are tastefully done but don't pull any punches. So, if you are uncomfortable in that regard beware. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> 4 stars but with some caveats </p>

 <p> This review by Scott Sammons (Christina's husband) using her account.In book two the sex hinted at in book three is brought to full bloom and while tastefully written and in no way prurient in nature (sorry Fifty Shades fans) is a factor of romance novel format that should be acknowledged.  Like the first book this needs a better editor with the power to send back for re-write prior to publication.  These stories are raw and need polishing to tighten them up into well crafted works.The use of Arabic and Muslim gestures and religious practices to designate the "Satanic" influences is sufficiently offensive to prevent me from reading further works in this series.  The characters are very believable and well crafted (Vulcan angelics aside), the dialogue is mostly very good, the imagined universe is creative and enduring, overall I enjoyed the book very much, the anti Muslim stance felt like such a cheap shot that it jarred my enjoyment through the first half of the book.It is with regret that I turn away from this author.  Those with fewer social quibbles or who have a similar prejudice and distain as the author may well enjoy the books even more than I did.Note to author a little more research in the means of silent killing with a knife to the throat would have helped an old farm boy who has bled out many an animal in the butchering process continue to suspend dis-belief (you never want to sever the trachea is you want to keep things quiet just plunge the knife in at the juggler / carotid and go behind the trachea other wise the bubbling froth is quite loud.  Romans chose to go for the subclavian artery for this reason to make executions quiet.  Thank you for your hard work I thoroughly enjoyed reading your books except for those times that I was deeply offended.  I consider it a cultural bias that may well be a factor of me being more sensitive that average (I turned away from a white supremacist culture and do not wish to return to its embrace)  In making White superior and non-white of questionable sentience, you have made the entire work tainted for me. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> In a strange, bizarre way, I received a copy of this book from the author, not in exchange for a review but as a belated birthday gift. After reading the book, I decided that it was so good that it would be a crime not to leave a review.I found the first book in the series, The Chosen One to be pretty awesome but there are times when I honestly wonder if I would have enjoyed the book as much if it wasn't because I've read the the first book in a sequel series, Angel of Death beforehand. This book made me know for sure that I would have loved the series no matter what.The plot. Oh, how can I even begin to describe the sheer complexity of the plot? This is a story that extends all the way back to the beginning of the universe, telling the tale of the creation and destruction of galaxies, matter and anti-matter and primordial goo, light vs darkness, good vs evil. The world she created wasn't entirely original. She did not cook up some new form of government. It's neither utopia nor dystopia. She simply took the template of the parliament that we have today and amplified it, casting the system upon an intergalactic society. So can someone please explain to me why the whole world with its hybrid army managed to capture my heart and blow my mind away? Hell, I'm not even a fan of intergalactic stuff. Was her story without fault? No. The technology, medical knowledge and culture of her stone-age earthlings were a little inconsistent at times, the "scientific" part of her story about genetics and all weren't all that convincing and there were times when I felt that the book could use a better proof-reading. Yet I still love her story so much, I can't wait for the next book in the series.I'm not kidding when I say that the all of the characters in the book have a life of their own. Reading her books is like taking an emotional surf on a beach - you get both high and low according to the mood of the characters. And sometimes, when the water gets too turbulent, you slip from your surf board and get drowned in all the emotions being poured from the pages of the book. With all due honesty, I simply can't count the number of times I wanted to wrench my heart out and cry for the characters. If you want to get an idea of how good her characters are, imagine this: I actually found myself sympathizing with a man who would beat the crap out of a pregnant woman. Bad guy? Who's the bad guy? In a war, there's no right and wrong, merely who's side you are on - and Erishkigal couldn't have spelt it out more clearly. She's also great when it comes it symbolism (I loved the pomegranate) and comparisons. I especially liked how she pitched her characters in the same situation at different times and showed us the difference in the way they responded due to the experiences that they have gone through. Same characters, same situation but different actions. It's like, she creates this complex background and personality for each of her character and pitch them into an elaborate web, then allows them to struggle and shows us the ripples that their struggles are causing. It's both breathtaking and amazing and before I know it, I found myself trapped in the same web.There are books that left me satisfied, books that were worth the time and money spent on them. Then there are books that I regretted wasting my time reading. And there are books that I would regret if I never read them at least once in my life. This book is one of them.If you want a good book about angels, intergalactic diplomacy and politics, as well as a whole new perspective of Lucifer, this book is definitely for you. </p>

 <p> OMG, what a great book and its free! I spent my weekend reading the 1st book in the Series Swords of the Gods Saga The Chosen and i got so caught up in the story as its that GOOD that i dove right in and read Prince of Tyre right after! i pulled an all nighter trying to finish both books! I can't believe these books are being offered for free (this is not a measly 200+ pages but 458 for book 1 and almost 800 for book 2)!You just made my top 10 fav authors and I would pay to read your books! </p>

 <p> The universe Anna Erishkigal built is peopled with Angels, gods, dragons lizards and all manner of beings including humans.  What I liked was the political back and forth that pops up. After creating all the creatures and cultures I feel like I may cry when the series is done. With her imagination and the varied &#34;folk&#34;, I am hoping for a long run! </p>

 <p> This author's work is very addictive. I want to read them all. So many different characters. Each one makes you want to know more about them. Each one of them has a uniqueness about them. If you like going back to a time of God's Angelina humans nd many other fantasy characters you will love all of these books. I have read three of them already and ready for the next. </p>

 <p> I got the first book for free, and knew before it was finished that I needed to know what happened to the characters. So, needless to say, I bought this book and I am well pleased with this book. I would like to read more by this author if it is in the same subject matter, one which truly intrigues me. </p>

 <p> I enjoy this series just wish there were more. I enjoy the writers style and the subject matter. She makes the characters believable. How would a stone age culture react to an Angelic. Very interesting read. </p>
