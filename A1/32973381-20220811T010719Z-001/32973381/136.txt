 <p> This battery was just what I needed.  I had ordered one previously and it didn't work but I think it was my fault for not sticking with the right numbers.  This one charged up and works fine. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Just what I needed. </p>

 <p> I do a lot of zooming in and out with my camera, that can drain the battery power faster than normal. It's good to gave extra batteries with me - I bought two and they work just fine. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Great source of power for camera </p>

 <p> I received the battery in good time and it does the job as we find out Fuji lost one on this camera with NOT putting a matching battery to meet the demanding needs of this camera, the Fujifilm FinePix SL1000,  so now we need & have to be MORE battery conscious than what is needed do to Fuji's failing to get, design, supply the customer/user with a battery that have a &#34;high-enough&#34; or sufficient enough power reserve by having the needed and PROPER  mAh capacity.  As you find out the 1700mAh battery does not last long, they could have and SHOULD  have used a 2200mAh or more battery for this camera design because by using the powerful Zoom and it's quick focus it is demanding much more than the poor Fuji designed factory/supplied  battery can supply and what it was &#34;designed-for&#34; Folks. So having one or two extra batteries is not a luxury but a very unfortunate &#34;necessity here. So these batteries function as do the factory/supplied  battery. </p>

 <p> One of Fuji's unfortunate Design flaws is their small battery capacity, so you have to buy more batteries than other camera's. </p>

 <p> Works great, no complaints so far. No fires or explosions so far. A must-have for the SL-1000. Three more words ... ah! </p>

 <p> No complaints </p>

 <p> I bought this for a  trip to Alaska, anticipating that my Fuji S1 would be the primary camera that I would be using on the cruise.  I knew one battery, the one that came with camera, would not be enough.  As expected, this battery had a lot of use and performed, it seemed to me, as well as the brand name battery that came with camera.If you are in need of an NP85 battery, this is a good choice. </p>

 <p> Performs As Well As The Fuji Battery </p>

 <p> The Extra (Replacement) Battery) works fine: It retains the charge very well depending on whether you are taking photos or using the HD video: </p>

 <p> When I ordered my new camera, I was initially disappointed that it didn't take AA batteries.  I ordered an extra Li-on battery and it's worked great.  I've found the battery life to be good, even though I use the zoom setting often.  I can take hundreds of shots--sometimes in just an hour--and it's nice to have a backup battery with me at all times.  The price was good, too. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Works great in my camera! </p>

 <p> It's always good to be prepared as a photographer. Getting a little extra equipment, doesn't hurt,Just get your pocket book ready. </p>

 <p> Just a back up piece for your camera. </p>
