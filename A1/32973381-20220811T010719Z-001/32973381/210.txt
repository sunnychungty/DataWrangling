 <p> I originally saw this film on SciFi Channel back in the early nineties during a Halloween marathon of horror films.  This is probably one of the best Peter Cushing/Christopher Lee movies, that rival even some of their better hammer era films.  The atmosphere isolated and creepy and the special effects are simple but very effective and startling.  It's also a real treat to see Lee and Cushing working together.The best way to describe this film is "Murder on the Orient Express" meets "The Thing".  A strange prehistoric missing link creature in discovered in a frozen countryside by Christopher Lee's character and is transported on a train.  Cushing plays Lee's professional rival, but they soon join forces when they discover the creature is a not so dead alien and is on the rampage turning passengers into mindless zombies.The movie's not perfect.  It has some awkward dialog in some spots, but other then that this film is an often overlooked diamond in the rough.  If your a fan of films like the Hammer Studios horror films or just curious about older horror movies of yesteryear give this one a try.  The new Blue-Ray edition of this classic by Severin has given this movie the treatment it deserves with some interesting extras. </p>

"Who loves you baby?!"I watched this movie many many years ago and it's on Bluray now with a CLEAR CRISP picture! (I'm not sure what these other reviewers are crying about the picture?)The picture quality is great and awesome!

 <p> I love trains in movies, and Spain's journey into the macabre, HORROR EXPRESS (1972), takes to the rails for a terror ride unlike any I've ever seen. The interesting premise takes place in the early 1900's aboard the Trans-Siberian Express which is carrying a prehistoric creature that escapes and goes on a killing spree. Horror legends Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing are fellow anthropologists who discover that the brain-sucking  monster's origins go back even further than their science can calculate. Telly Savalas is tops as a crazy Cossack who hijacks the train.HORROR EXPRESS keeps its momentum of suspense and shock chugging along at full steam, courtesy its director, Eugenio Martin. The film contains some grisly imagery, such as when the creature attacks its victims leaving their eyes white and bloodied. There's also a scene of an operation in which the top half of a person's skull is removed. The creature itself is effectively shown in brief shots and is pretty nasty looking. Adding to the unique, creepy atmosphere is a memorable music score by John Cacavas.I first saw this cult favorite on a budget DVD set with badly faded color and incorrect aspect ratio. Even under such undesirable viewing conditions, I could appreciate that an excellent film was begging to burst forth. My hopes were vindicated when I picked up Severen's gorgeously restored Blu-ray/DVD Combo Edition. Transferred in HD from pristine vault elements, this is the way HORROR EXPRESS was meant to be seen.The extras include an intro by Fangoria Magazine editor Chris Alexander, an interview with director Eugenio Martin, a discussion about the McCarthy era with producer Bernard Gordon, a 1973 audio interview with Peter Cushing, an interview with composer John Cacavas on Telly Savalas, and the original theatrical trailer. The disc contains the original Spanish language with English subtitles, and the English dubbed track.HORROR EXPRESS is an offbeat, underrated mixture of horror and science-fiction with touches of humor that's well worth checking out. This is one train ride you'll be taking again, trust me. </p>

 <p> Director Eugenio Mart&iacute;n's 1972 fright film, HORROR EXPRESS (P&Aacute;NICO EN EL TRANSIBERIANO) is, arguably, the most interesting and enjoyable 70s pairing of acclaimed horror film stars Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. Long considered to be in the public domain in America, this British-Spanish co-production has seen dozens (at least) of crappy, washed out, battered-looking video releases over the years. Now, thanks to the fine folks at Severin Films, this Gothic gem finally receives the high-quality, high-definition treatment it deserves in an extraordinary DVD/Blu-ray Combo pack.In 1906 China, Professor Alexander Saxton (Christopher Lee, HORROR OF DRACULA, THE RESIDENT) unearths a frozen fossil in the Manchurian province of Szechuan that he believes may be the "missing link." Determined to bring the fossil back to England, he crates up the creepy creature's remains, drags it to Shanghai and boards the trans-Siberian Express train, where he encounters professional rival Dr. Wells (Peter Cushing, FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED, SHOCK WAVES). During the trip, an alien entity trapped within the icy corpse is released, possessing various passengers, absorbing their knowledge and memories, and then moving on, leaving blank-eyed corpses in its wake. The two British scientists set out to identify and destroy the creature, but their efforts are complicated by paranoia among the survivors and the arrival of an overbearing Russian military officer (Telly Savalas).HORROR EXPRESS is a delightfully claustrophobic and suspenseful mishmash of Gothic horror, zombie, sci-fi and serial killer tropes, with a dash of 70s Satanic possession elements tossed in for spice. With a twisty, witty and constantly surprising screenplay written to take advantage of a detailed - and startlingly realistic - vintage steam train model built for another movie, HORROR EXPRESS is 90 fast-paced minutes of thrills, chills, and terrific performances by a talented, International cast. The special effects are remarkably good - and surprisingly gory - for a film of its vintage, and the production values are top-notch. The eerie score by composer John Cacavas is also noteworthy, adding considerably to the overall success of the film.Cushing and Lee are in fine form, the two old friends playing off each other magnificently, and - unlike many of their 70s pairings - enjoying equal screen time and prominence in the plot.  Eurobeauties Helga Lin&eacute; and Silvia Tortosa provide lovely eye candy, and Savalas is a hoot as the arrogant Cossack, Captain Kazan, assigned by his superiors to investigate the murders on the speeding train.As stated above, HORROR EXPRESS has seen many previous home video releases on VHS and DVD, including a fairly decent, non-anamorphic DVD from Image Entertainment back in the late 90s. For this new edition, Severin Films has used the original Spanish negative as the source of their 1.66:1 widescreen 1080p HD transfer. Clearly, the custodians of the negative didn't take particularly good care of it - there is minor damage throughout in the form of specks and small scratches. But the colors are bright, detail is astounding, and the overall visual presentation is light years superior to any previous home video release. Two audio options are provided: English and Spanish dialogue tracks in Dolby 2.0 mono.Severin has assembled a nice batch of supplements, including an enthusiastic Introduction by Fangoria editor Chris Alexander, new interviews with director Mart&iacute;n, producer Bernard Gordon and composer Cacavas, and a vintage audio Interview with Peter Cushing, which can be played as a commentary over the film, and which covers the distinguished actor's film career in great detail. Finally, there's the creepy theatrical trailer, along with previews of three other Severin titles - PSYCHOMANIA, NIGHTMARE CASTLE and the forthcoming THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD.This new HORROR EXPRESS Blu-ray/DVD combo is, by far, the finest presentation of the movie to date, and barring a future, frame-by-frame digital restoration, likely to be the definitive video version for some time to come. Fans of the film and or the Lee & Cushing team - even if they don't own a Blu-ray player - should pick it up; it's reasonably priced and the DVD contains the same fine transfer and bonus material as the Blu-ray disc, albeit in standard definition.HORROR EXPRESS is a classic chiller, and highly recommended. </p>

 <p> A 70s Lee-Cushing Gem </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> In many ways, this is typical early '70s Brit horror schlock.  The basic plot of the film is that a corpse of a "missing link" is found in China, and shipped to somewhere in Europe (assumedly England, though I don't recall any of the characters really saying where they were going) via rail-road across Russia, and the characters who are riding the train are then terrorized by victims of the awakened "spirit" that possesses the "missing link"--a somewhat demonic, otherworldly, alien spirit that ultimately seems to want to go to space.  (None of this is ever explained very well, unsurprisingly, but it doesn't really matter much, either).  At the very beginning, with voice-over narration to a historical society regarding a catastrophe, long introductions to several characters and their interactions, and the usage of a spooky song (played via piano by characters, as a score by the makers of the movie, and whistled several times), it opened well.  Christopher Lee is good, a combination of awkward action hero and gruff misanthrope as a scientist who obtains the 2-million-old corpse of a "missing link" and who struggles first against those whom he thinks mean to exploit it (at the expense of his own exploitation of it, of course), and than in understanding what it going on, and finally against the "spirit" which once possessed the "missing link."  So is Telly Savalas in a strange but enjoyable bit of casting as a Cossack commander, chewing up scenery and swaggering, though I don't think he appears until the last 40 minutes or so of the film.However, the plot meanders and most characters are never fully developed. Certain conventions of the Brit 1960's/70's horror films--beautiful women, languid nobels, brilliant scientists, foolish peasants, traditional views of Victorian manners, exotic locales, etc, are used, but, frankly, poorly and clumsily compared to a few of the "classics" of the era (several of the well-known Hammer films, for example). At least one character is so oddly drawn--the Russian priest--that I can't help but think the writer of this film was caricaturing him to skewer some sort of deep psychological problem with organized religion. Some of the cinematagraphy is amateurish. Special effects are typical of the period and of this type of movie--blood that looks like red paint, a glowing red eye that shines like a lightbulb, zombies who are just actors with white contact lenses in their eyes--with ruddy cheeks, no less. And then, the movie just ends, after an attempted zombie takeover of the train, and most of the train explodes, and some of the people are saved, I guess.Ultimately, another of those somewhat entertaining films that had a lot of potential but was doomed by mediocre direction, poor writing, a lack of funding, a inability to break from genre conventions, and a certain lack of imagination. </p>

 <p> Horror Express has always suffered from the fact that most available prints were dark and grainy--almost painful to watch!This blu-Ray, however, is crisp and clean--a pleasure to watch.Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing are, as usual, quite good.  The story is interesting and internally coherent if a bit confused.The big problem here is Telly Savalas.  He seems to be in another film and his entrance and over-the-top performance really hurt the film.Still, it's an entertaining piece of film history--and one I would recommend to any horror fan with a bit of patience and the ability to ignore a high-ham content. </p>

 <p> Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing were "the best of screen enemies" (to quote Lee). So it's entertaining to see them in a different kind of movie, such as "Horror Express," a somewhat hokey horror movie that is made up for by some excellent performances and pervasive creepiness. You'll never look at a fossil quite the same way again.Professor Saxton (Christopher Lee) uncovers a frozen ape-man in northern China, and has it crated and loaded on the Trans-Siberian Express. But after his colleague Dr. Wells (Peter Cushing) bribes the baggage man to peek inside, the baggage man is found dead, with bloody white eyes -- and the fossil is gone. More people fall prey to the creature before it's fatally shot by a Russian police officer.But it soon becomes apparent that the creature may be dead -- but whatever was inside it has just moved on to its next host. Wells and Saxton try to puzzle out what they are dealing with, while a mad monk (Alberto de Mendoza) tries to help the possessed officer, believing him to be Satan. To top things off, a force of Cossack soldiers have arrived to deal with the threat..."Horror Express" is one of those movies that would normally be B-grade all around -- capable, but nothing really memorable. The plot about a bodysnatching, memory-sucking alien is kinda hokey. But it's the presentation that makes it really interesting, with Lee and Cushing as a pair of scientists, and a sense of mystery around what the creature really is.And it all takes place in the confines of a train, which gives the movie a claustrophobic feeling, as well as making it seem a bit like a horror version of "Murder on the Orient Express." The dialogue ranges from silly ("There's a stink of hell on this train!") to slyly satirical ("But what if one of you is the monster?" "Monster? We're BRITISH, you know!").Lee and Cushing are the bright spots in here, as the uptight, scientific-minded Saxton and the friendly Wells, who keeps rubbing Saxton the wrong way. It's interesting to see them as allies ("friends" would be pushing it), and the the two actors give plenty of little details to their strong performances. Dracula and Van Helsing, they ain't. And Telly Savalas shows up briefly as a swaggering, likable Cossack captain.So from what I've been able to work out, this set is a dual blu-ray/DVD which is hi-def 1.66:1, and has a director interview, an interview about Telly Savalas, an audio interview with Cushing, a new introduction, the trailer, an Easter egg and... an interview about the McCarthy era. HUH?"Horror Express" is basically a B-movie with the usual weak and solid moments, but some grade-A talent making it worthwhile. Enjoyably spooky. </p>

 <p> A previous review was critical of the image quality, but I've never seen this film look better (I hope they also found a new print ofShock Wavesin that Mongolian film vault).  I like to see a few flaws in the film - reminders that I'm watching something made in 1972.  The Spanish credits and use of its original title further enhanced the feeling of seeing this for the first time.  The use of a 1973 Peter Cushing interview as the commentary track is a nice touch, as is the inclusion of three "bonus" trailers.The film itself is great - in my opinion, far superior to any genre films Hammer/Tigon/Amicus produced in the 70's.  An alien fossil thaws-out and infiltrates an isolated group of humans.  Sound familiar? </p>

 <p> I just Love this film, The actors are all great and I like the story as well. Christopher Lee brings an ancient creature on a train that gets out and all Hell gets lose sort of speaking. This movie is loaded with great atmosphere with the snow and cold and terrified passengers on the train with the creature and no escape. Telly Savalas does one of his best acting roles in this film as a Russian Cossack officer who boards the train later in the film .Him and all the passengers going for a wild ride with the creature on board as the killings go on. If you like horror movies and mystery train movies you will have both here to enjoy. </p>

 <p> I have always liked this movie, primarily because it has two of my all time favorite actors in it, Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. I remember watching this one in the '70s on TV and recall how dark it was, the print of the movie itself that is. We had a new color console TV we had bought and the film still looked rather bleak. VHS was years away still and even in the '80s when VHS was so prominent, I rented it one time and the copy was poor to say the least. I am so proud that this movie finally gets it's due on the wonderful format of bluray! I am proudly replacing or buying outright for the first time several movies with these two actors.If you are a horror fan of movies with these two actors, I highly recommend you get this one to add to your collection. The storyline and plot are well written, in my opinion. I thought the movie was well shot, considering what technology was at hand to do it in 1972 or early '70s. Remaking a movie like this today would cost so much more and probably be not as entertaining as this one. There is that element of realism in this one when one looks at the &#34;monster&#34;. For me as a kid watching it for the first time, I thought they had dug up something out of a museum to use in the picture. lol Seriously though, I think it still stands as one of the best horror movies to come out of the 1970s and we sure have a few gems in that decade to go along with this title. Well done! </p>

Screen legends Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing star as rival turn-of-the-century anthropologists transporting a frozen `missing link' aboard the Trans-Siberian Express. But when the prehistoric creature thaws and escapes, it unleashes a brain-scarfing spree that turns its victims into the eye-bleeding undead. Can the crafty colleagues stop this two million year old monster, hordes of zombie passengers and a psychotic Cossack officer (Telly Savalas) before terror goes off the rails? Silvia Tortosa (When The Screaming Stops) co-stars in this all-time fright favorite from director Eugenio Mart&iacute;n and the blacklisted Hollywood screenwriters of Psychomania, now featuring explosive new Extras and a stunning HD transfer from vault elements recently unearthed in a Mongolian film depot!EXTRAS:* Murder On The Trans-Siberian Express: New Interview With Director Eugenio Martin* Notes From The Blacklist: Producer Bernard Gordon Discusses The McCarthy Era* The Guardian Interview With Peter Cushing 1973 (Audio only)* Telly And Me: New Interview With Composer John Cacavas* Introduction by Fangoria Editor Chris Alexander* Theatrical TrailerBlu-Ray / DVD Combo Video Specs: 1.66:1 1080p (Blu-Ray), 1.66:1 Anamorphic Widescreen (DVD)Running Times: 90 minutesAudio Specs: Original MonoLanguages: EnglishRegion Code: AllRelease Date: November 22nd, 2011 </p>

I have to say this is a really good version of the film and i enjoyed it and will continue to do so for quite a while it is really the best I have seen on dvd.I am impressed with the transfer and encourage all fans of the movie to get this version. If you have only heard or read of the film I recommend you get this and enjoy the film it is a lot of fun and the late Telly Savalas steals the show. So get a copy put in your player, sit down, and enjoy. </p>

 <p> It's got a stylish, modern title, and its opening titles are in a slick, hyper-modern font...from the opening moments, this is clearly a film for the modern mind. But it's actually a period film...and it closes with a rock music version of its theme...I guess we could call this Period Cool!A frozen caveman-like creature dug up in an archaeological expedition comes to life and begins killing the passengers of the Trans-Siberian Express. That may sound like sufficient material for a low-budget horror piece. But two rival scientists on the train quickly discover that much more is going on, and are forced to work together to stay alive!The enigmatic creature appears to be getting smarter with each person it kills--indeed, it appears to be draining the minds of its victims and absorbing their intelligence.  But "There's something more..." It gets even more interesting than that--and you're going to have to watch the film to find out what happens.This is one of the best horror films of the 1970's...featuring many creative ideas and a fine cast including Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Telly Savalas (who steals the show during his brief appearance) and Silvia Tortosa. Everyone is lots of fun, and while this film is fairly gory, it's no mere bloodbath. It requires constant attention from the viewer as the story is actually rather complex. And unlike the characters we find in most current horror films, the characters in "Horror Express" are intelligent people, and their attempts to analyze the strange science-fictional situation in which they find themselves are most engrossing. Heck, even the monster in this movie is smart.It's strange to consider that, though it features all the trappings of a horror film (monster, reanimated corpses, chilly environment, etc.) it has little of the conventional atmosphere...it's very thinky, and so cleverly funny that the word "giddy" can be used to describe it. The cast seems to have enjoyed the opportunity to work with such an interesting story. It transcends its genre.So much fun that the rough edges from its low budget are easy to ignore. One of the most enjoyable things Lee and Cushing did together. </p>

 <p> I was happy to see this wonderfully creepy film get a blu-ray/DVD combo release that it deserves.  The print is startlingly clean and beautiful, colors are gorgeous, picture sharp and clean, and the sound is clear and haunting.The pairing of Lee and Cushing has always been a draw for fans of European cinema.  Hammer made both actors international stars, pitting them against each other in such classics as The Horror of Dracula (US title) and The Mummy.  In this Spanish co-production, both actors, cast as rivals, must join forces to beat an ancient evil that threatens to kill everyone aboard the Trans Siberian Express. There is horror, humor, and gore for everyone.Image released this film several years ago in the only decent print on the market, but this release blows it out of the water.  Recommended highly. </p>

The Spanish-British "Horror Express" (1972) makes inventive use of its limited budget - resulting in an offbeat mix of terror and mystery. A late-night "Creature Features" favorite with a smashing climax. Long available in the public domain, this Severin release boasts the finest widescreen transfer to date. </p>

 <p> One great remake of &#34;The Thing from another World, but on a train. I'm surprised I waited this long to on it. Lee and Cushing are always great to watch. </p>

 <p> Please note that this review is for the quality of this Blu Ray disc only.  The movie itself is definately 5 stars! I am disappointed with this Blu Ray release.  It appears that there has been little or no restoration to the so-called newly found print from Mongolia of all places.  Sure, the picture quality itself is up to Blu Ray standards as compared with the DVD (also included in this package).  But as you probably know, there have been several "public domain" releases and one official release (now out-of-print) from Image Entertainment. Well, the dots and print scratches are still here on this Blu Ray release! In some cases, depending which DVD release you compare it with, there is a slight reduction in these imperfections, but I guess I'm spoiled by other Blu Ray releases that have previously only been available as poor quality "public domain" material DVDs.Here is an example:  If you're a fan of these classic, yet underated or obscure horror flicks, then you may be familar with Roger Corman's "The Terror" starring Boris Karloff and a very young Jack Nicholson (1963).  There have been at least a dozen DVD releases of this film, most of fairly poor quality, scratches, washed out color, etc. And I owned all of them! But earlier this year, Film Crest, Inc. released it on Blu Ray, Digitally Remastered HD Restoration, and the quality is breath-taking!!  Hardly a speck or scratch. There is even a side by side restoration comparision in the menu.Sadly, this is not the case with "The Horror Express." But here it is, a Blu Ray that falls short in the restoration department.  Still, I suppose it is worth owning for its 1080p resolution, but I guess (to use the title of a more recent Jack Nicholson film) this is As Good As It (is going to) Get(s). </p>

 <p> Severin films has released Director Eugenio Martin's 'HORROR EXPRESS'-1972 into the Blu-Ray age.  Since the original negative had a murky, grainy look to it when I saw it theatrically, this release resembles an improvement over the Image Entertainment release from over a decade ago but not much of a difference.  The 1.85 transfer looks about the same in the DVD disc included with the Blu-Ray and it seems that these companies believe that if you release any film in that format, it will blow you away.  Not true, proof of that is the Blu-ray release of Director Roger Corman's 'THE TERROR'-1964 ,some of these films negatives cannot improve because they were inferior to begin with. The transfer, however, allows you to enjoy the bantering of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee as they are serious one minute spouting scientific jargon and the next they are flirting with hot babes Helga Line and Silvia Tortosa. You will recognize many Spaghetti Western faces such as Jorge Rigaud and why not, Director Martin gave us many underrated Euro-Oaters.  Enter Telly Savalas into the mix and you have one of the most entertaining hoots in Horror history all taking place on a train which is one of my favorite things. The memorable music score by John Cacavas with its catchy whistle refrain and Photography by Euro cult artiste Alejandro Ulla makes the film gell to the max making the absurd plot easier to swallow.  Recommended to all Horror fans, the Blu-ray format is not necessary to appreciate this cult classic. </p>
