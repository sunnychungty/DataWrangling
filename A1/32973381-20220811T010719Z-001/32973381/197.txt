 <p> I purchased the DVD The Mikado from Amazon.  It is a very enjoyable version of the Gilbert and Sullivan favorite.  I would recommend purchasing it to anyone who likes good music. </p>

 <p> One of the only two in the so-called "complete" Gilbert & Sullivan series(and it isn't complete at all) which actually has all of the complete dialog and music, even though the film, especially in Act Two, seems to have been performed at breakneck speed in order to squeeze everything in. However, in all fairness, there were some rather interesting things also done in this performance.  Set more or less in Meiji Japan, we see hot-air balloons, a contemporary railway, Pish-Tush dressed in the odd semi-western finery so often seen in late Victorian Japan - and most delightful, Nanki-Poo actually carrying a trombone.  I have mixed feelings about William Conrad as the Mikado, who really couldn't carry a tune in a bucket and stumbled over the lyrics as well. All the same, he looked wonderful, more like a huge Chinese Manadrin than the Emperor of Japan, but his disappointed delivery of "Bless my heart, my son." was worth all the rest of it.  My own personal disappointment, however, was Clive Reville as Koko.  He is a veteran stage comedian with impressive credits, including the original Emperor Palpatine in "The Empire Strikes Back" - but he simply looked and acted too much like Mel Brooks to convince me that he was Koko.  Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed this production.  But it might have worked better on stage, where timing isn't so crucial. </p>

 <p> Who would have believed that Cannon or the Fat Man could carry a tune, but William Conrad isn't too bad.  He may never win a Grammy, but in this production of the Operetta, he does quite a decent job.  Even if you are not a fan of Opera, Gilbert and Sullivan is still easy to enjoy because their storylines are not as depressing as regular operas. Also, the English dialogue makes the story much more accessible to a wider audience.  I look forward to the release of Pirates of Penzance, Linda Ronstadts version, of course, so that I can have two very enjoyable muscials available any time I wish.  The productions may not be Hollywood lavish, but they are effective and entertaining. </p>

 <p> I prefer the d'Oyly Carte/ Kenny Baker performance (now released on Blue Ray with restored color and somewhat better sound) in spite of the primitive (1939) photography;  Baker is by far the most believable Nanki-Poo; Martin Green as Ko-ko is unbeatable  in my book.My second choice is the Stratford Festival recording with excellent photography and stage craft; this in spite of what seems to me a colorless performance by the actor playing Nanki-Poo. Choreography is incorporated sparingly and effectively.For me, the Opera World performance has too much inappropriate choreography, and lacks any notable performances, except perhaps that of Clive Revill as Ko-ko.  The inclusion of the libretto, and of Douglas Fairbanks' introductory comments, add to the attractiveness of this offering </p>

 <p> My third choice for a Mikado recording </p>

 <p> I borrowed this from the library, and on the whole, I enjoyed it, because it is one of my favourite G & S Operettas.Clive Revill, who inhabits the role of Koko like a second skin, is splendid in the role of the Lord High Executioner of Titipu. His split-second comic timing makes him seem an authentic Savoyard, as members of the original G & S Light opera company were known. Although their voices are up to the task, the other members of the company do not seem quite as at home in their roles.The 'Eighties film has a curiously dated look, although the costumes and set (and clever gimmicks of Katisha's hot-air  balloon and the Mikado's steam-powered train) are beautiful. The choreography seems unnecessarily busy, with actors waving the long sleeves of their kimonos wildly, and moving aimlessly back and forth and around in circles. If you want a the feel of what an actual D'Oyley Carte production was actually like, watch the delightful 1999 film of "Topsy Turvy", which depicts rehearsals and entire finished scenes of "The Mikado." (This film prompted me to pull "Topsy Turvy" off the shelf and watch it again. A delightful experience!).The singing is generally excellent (Conrad excepted, but he's not impossible), and the music will make you feel ridiculously happy. One can see why these comic operas were hits. Sullivan's musical nods to Giuseppe Verdi in the choral ensembles are delightful (one wonders whether he was sending up the style of his popular Italian contemporary), and practically every musical number is memorable. One is guaranteed to be humming "Miya sama", "The Flowers that Bloom in the Spring, Tra-La" or "Tit-Willow" for hours!It's a shame that Acorn Media did not see fit to provide the subtitles for this largely enjoyable production, because WS Gilbert's libretto for "The Mikado" ranks among his wittiest; its Victorian notions about parliamentary politics and beauty are also surprisingly up-to-date.  As another viewer has remarked, unless one is familiar with the words, one will likely not understand them. And if you don't understand "There's a fascination frantic in a ruin that's romantic, do you think that your sufficiently decayed?" with which Koko reluctantly woos Katisha, you have missed out on Gilbert's delicious wit.And as beautiful as the melodies are, complete understanding of the Gilbert half of the team is essential for the full enjoyment of Sullivan's music. </p>

 <p> If you want accurate renditions of the venerable Gilbert & Sullivan, try to find the D'Orly Carte Company's version.  They are the original company that G&S started and tutored to perform their operettas. </p>

 <p> My roommate and I have seen the Mikado in person in January and the old Kenny Baker DVD in March, and we've seen The Mikado last year in person at the City Center, and many times in NYC and even the Hot Mikado in Pittsburgh. This DVD is worth buying for many good reasons. Some lyrics were heard for the very first time by us because we could hear the words and even read their lips on those wonderful close-ups. The sets and costumes were good and the direction was fine. CLIVE REVILL was kind of ugly and unsuited to the role as KOKO but we laughed anyway. His costume was the worst. The Lord High Executioner had a rich bass voice and THE CHORUS was the best we have ever heard!!!!!! Katisha was great! William Cannon as the Mikado does not have a good voice, but he put in a decent performance. The young leads were fine.The City Center guys were a lot better as Pooh-bah and Koko, but their Wandering Minstrel is bald and homely and waaaay too old, so this DVD has given us a younger and cuter [and taller] HERO with a delightful voice. The film quality is great. Light years better than the old old Kenny Baker one which we also enjoyed because it was funnier. The chorus alone is worth your time, and it isn't expensive.This version comes with a complete libretto which I had to pay a lot of money for separately elsewhere because I didn't know it came with the DVD. </p>

 <p> I decided that before I purchased this DVD, I would rent it, just to be sure it was something I would want to see again and again. How fortunate for me that I made that decision. This is a horrible production. The costumes are confusing and the choreography, bizarre. Nanki Poo with a trombone? Good grief. I'm still searching for a good production of The Mikado, because I would love to own it, but certainly not this one! </p>

 <p> Well go ahead and put my name on the list, but I liked this DVD.There is so much material available for local companies to choose from, live G&S; productions are not done very much. I was lucky to see The Mikado at the Denton TX playhouse in the late 90s.I don't need perfection in art to enjoy it. </p>

 <p> This 1983 production of Gilbert & Sullivan's hit play, The Mikado, takes the viewer to a fun and funny Japan where all sorts of hilarity happens. Ko-Ko, the rather incompetent Lord High Executioner needs an execution on his record to please the Mikado, and finds a likely candidate in the form of Nanki-Poo, a wandering minstrel. Unknown to Ko-Ko, Nanki-Poo is actually the son of the Mikado, traveling incognito to avoid an undesirable marriage! Hilarity ensues as the various characters find love...or at least marriage.This is a very good production of The Mikado, with a very good cast, and excellent scenery. Personally, I thought that Stafford Dean, who played Pooh-Bah, the Lord High Everything Else, practically stole the show with the excellence of his performance. Nonetheless, it is a great production of the play, and I don't hesitate to recommend it to everyone! </p>

 <p> This 1982, BBC/PBS, made-for-TV production is somewhat dated.  The technical aspects, including sound work would be done better today.  It is easy to hear and to understand the play, but there is very little stereo effect, and today's 5.1 sound would make it even better.One feature I appreciated was the included libretto, which follows the one from Bradley's book closely.  There are no captions of any kind.I was surprised to see Joseph Conrad cast as the Mikado; I didn't know he could sing.  As it turns out, he will never be known for it, but he acquitted himself well in the few solos he had.  John Stewart, as Nanki-Poo, was excellent, but the best singing was from the two female leads, Kate Flowers and Anne Collins, who played Yum-Yum and Katisha respectively.In spite of the truly poor choreography and cheap-looking sets and costumes, this is the best production of The Mikado that I have seen to date, but I would very much like to see the complete play done by the actors from the movie, Topsy-Turvy (another recommended movie, but not for children).  (It's at:Topsy-Turvy)If you are inclined to be picky about your Gilbert & Sullivan, you may find this DVD to deliver less than you desire, but I am happy to enjoy the lighthearted show in a lighthearted manner and forgive the few flaws.Recommended. </p>

 <p> Refer to the reviews that actually review instead of talking about their feelings, and my opinions are similar. The Opera World version of The Mikado is one of the picks of that series and infinitely better than any other version I've seen - and that would be just about all of them. We have excellent casting in most of the named parts except for William Conrad, whose elfin take on the part is cute but who manages to only barely hold on to the notes. But every time I watch, I catch another little nuance in facial expressions (watch for Peep Bo's sly little looks). And, best of all, the glorious voices of Nanki-Poo (John Stewart) and Yum Yum (Kate Flowers)! If I could find any thing else with Mr. Stewart's voice I'd snap it up in a heartbeat! </p>
