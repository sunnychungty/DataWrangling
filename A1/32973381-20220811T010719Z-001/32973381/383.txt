<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> I really wavered on this review. Part of me thought it was 5 stars and the other 2 stars. I compromised and rounded up. I liked the characters - although you never feel that connected to them or at least I didn't. They existed as they were then - not a lot of background. Simon in particular comes off as cold in many places. Although there are glimpses that he's just uncomfortable naming his emotions - and working his darndest to avoid anything remotely resembling love. While that could be because of his background you get the sense it is more than that but it's never explained.Maura was very interesting. A submissive in charge of her normal life who intentionally gives control over. There is a stereotype that a submissive has to have someone else controlling - but that's not really true. They give up control because they want to. I thought her caution was appropriate and earned her a lot of respect from me.As for the BDSM content - the other reviewers are correct. It is *extremely* intense. In fact I'd class it as con non-con as the book uses the rape word repeatedly - and then adding statements that she allows him to do it as he owns her. Those who are not comfortable with this type of consent will be hard pressed to continue reading. I have read some heavy and more hard core BDSM but needles have been on my hard limit list for some time - after this book I'm not likely to change my mind anytime soon. I had an intense dislike for that scene - I almost stopped reading.Still overall I read it in one sitting - and could not put it down. Was I uncomfortable in places? Heck yes! However the writing (with some grammatical and spelling errors) kept me absorbed and wanting to find out not only how it ended but what brought them to this point. The use of flashbacks was ok. but not consistent enough for me. Those who are willing to explore D/s in a more than "casually kinky" way should give this one a go. </p>

 <p> This is not your HEA story in the least but if you can get past that this is one very good story.  It is a very hard hitting BDSM story with a little bit of everything you could imagine.  Definitly more on the dark side but has a good and interesting plot. </p>

 <p> If you're into the BDSM flavored erotica a la Cherise Sinclair or Lexi Blake then this probably isn't for you.  If you're looking for a romantic element then this also may not be your thing.  It does feature a lot more S&M than most mainstream erotica.  For me the book was just ok, a little too much pain for my tastes but to each their own. </p>

 <p> On the whole I enjoyed reading Carolyn Faulkner's, Submissive Desires. However, it really got me thinking...about safety & sticking needles into breast tissue and beating breast tissue. Is it safe? Even purporting such issues in a story, it leaves me with concerns. Women are told to monitor for years after a knock or heamatoma/blood blister or severe bruise. I'm not really happy about endorsing books that encourage it. The rest well Simon, cool, calculating, self controlled or is he beneath the surface? He didn't want to recognise or admit it but the absolute need and trust they had for each other is what I see as love, real love as opposed to chemical attraction and infatuation that's sometimes mistaken for love. Simon and Maura I believe have love though not openly demonstrative and acknowledged by him and also the lust, more important in their relationship, as  each has their needs met in the other. As much as this level of beatings and pain wouldn't suit too many people, even within the BDSM community and you need to need an inordinate amount of pain and tolerance to such spanking and canings to get off on the things Maura got off on, and then there's Simon's pleasure in his realised sadistic streak, yet always knowing and monitoring Maura for how far he could take her or each other for that matter, suggests they were the perfect couple, a match made for heaven and hell! Negatives...a few too many typo's for a professionally edited book, which lets it down somewhat. However, I still rate it as just four stars.For adults only. </p>

 <p> This was fantastic to read! Definitely a 'too good to put down' story. The reviewer who said it was not for the faint at heart was entirely correct but I am so glad I overcame my hesitation!  Good realistic characters who were not one dimensional or too far out to believe and a story with lots to say. My first exposure to real power exchange and the concept that sex and discipline are not always for 'sharing' pleasure. The ending was a 'gasping conclusion', but once I recovered, I liked it because it seemed consistent with the realism in the rest of the story. As with many novels the wealth of the male 'hero' seemed like the only unrealistic (although it was minor) aspect of the story. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a sincere curiosity about BDSM. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> I wasn't as taken with this book as I had expected to be. I didn't find it to be very intense and, frankly, the punishment and D/s aspects of the book didn't seem very serious to me. The author kept describing and stating how Maura needed what Simon did to her, but I just wasn't buying it. Maura seemed more like a bad kid that was being punished by a father-figure instead of her lover or dom. Also, all of her whining and squealing were not appealing at all...one thing that really bothers me are persistent brats (especially in this case where Maura is supposed to be 37 yrs old, but is pouting and whining like a child). Simon says that he is going to be sterner with her, but it never seems like she learns, respects him, or even wants to be dominated. It's as though she is just playing along, but really doesn't get anything out of it.As much as I wanted to like it, I just couldn't get into the book or the characters. There was a lot of potential, but too much time was spent on telling the reader about how their relationship was developing and what they felt for each other rather than actually painting a vivid image and story. </p>

 <p> Unless you're into hard-core paddling and caning, stay away from this one.  It was poorly published, the errors were distracting and multiple.  Simon came off as a brute and sadistic, with little feelings for the intense pain he was causing the woman he professed to be intrigued with.  The constant, repetitive descriptions of the welts he raised on her bottom, and his seemingly fascination with watching them turn purple and caressing them, while she whimpered in pain was a real turn-off.  The feeble attempts taken to make it sound as if she really did enjoy the beating because she thought she "needed them" was just that--a feeble attempt to justify his behavior. There is  nothing sexy about an abusive man, tying up a woman and taking pleasure in beating her--not even in the name of BDSM.  This book has gone in the trash! </p>

 <p> What ABSOLUTE crap!  I am not new to BDSM fiction and have read all sorts from mild to extreme but I have never read such rubbish before.  The unlikeable characters, the weak storyline and the lack of editing all contributed to make this the worst book I have ever read!  The real story here is how did I finish it? </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> The plot has already been mentioned in other reviews, so I'll just give my opinion on the overall story.I disagree with the reviews that didn't see this as a love story. Although Simon doesn't say it or even fully admit it even to himself, he loves her.  Both of them have their needs met.  They seem totally focused on each other and surprisingly happy. Neither seems interested in conventional marriage.  Simon, despite his sadism, is extremely careful of her ultimate well-being.  There are little hints of his softer side with brief mentions of &#34;cuddle times&#34; and his gentle &#34;after care&#34; when he's really pushed her limits.At times the physical brutality is hard to take and I wished the author had included Maura using her safe word a few times which would have brought a sense of balance to their relationship.  My one other criticism is the medical aspect of their lifestyle since there is nearly constant spankings on top of spankings/canings, breast torment, etc.  Can a body endure such constant abuse over time?  I would have liked some mention of how that was dealt with.This book is definitely not for the faint hearted, but it is well written.  It explores the most intense type of d/s relationship that still remains consensual... and in their own way, loving. </p>

 <p> Rating:  3.5 StarsA good story about the beginnings of a BDSM-TPE relationship between Simon (Older, ex-Navy SEAL, dominant, controller) and Maura (Aspiring writer, exploring her submissive side, independent).  This story reminded me of &#34;As She's Told&#34; by Anneke Jacob, but not as hard core or long.  I always enjoy a book where both parties are OK with the relationship instead of, typically the guy is trying to convince and beg the girl that she wants it.  Both Simon and Maura want this type of relationship, Simon more so than Maura.  It flips back and forth from present day and when they first met.Maura really enjoyed pain.  It was very uncomfortable reading some of the things she went through to get sexual satisfaction.  I thought Simon loved giving it to her and he was absolutely in control of everything.  I think he was feeling love towards Maura, he just did not know it at the time.  Bravo to Carolyn Faulkner for not making excuses as to why Simon and Maura enjoyed this lifestyle.  It was refreshing to read that they were not victims of child abuse and this is why they live in the lifestyle. All in all, it was a very fast read and I liked it.Why Not 5 Stars?There was zero backstory on Simon and Maura.  Meaning, what happened in their previous relationships, were they always into BDSM, how/why did Maura enjoy pain, Simon was married before, what happened?  Did Maura sell books for a living?  Any parents, siblings, or children?  Inquiring minds want to know.Lack of an epilogue.  I felt it needed one. </p>

 <p> Very interesting writing style for this one, but it keeps you engaged flipping back and forth between the present and five years ago when the characters were first together. It shows their evolution through the years. I think this flipping back in forth through time is actually what allows you to hear about the intensity of their relationship without having it affect the reader too much. The reader feels as if they are being "told" the story rather than as if they're present in current time witness it happen. The reader is already at the end (even at the beginning) and knows that there's a happy ending (happy to them anyway) and that they're getting what they want. That somehow mitigates some of the otherwise cringe-worthy aspects to the story. The scenes are written in vibrant detail, so most certainly heed the warning for this one. </p>

 <p> When will I learn that this author does not write stories that I will find erotic? Perhaps this will be the last time I try one of Carolyn Faulkner's stories?This book should be retitled; Masochistic Controlling Desires. Because it's not the submission that is explored so much as her pain tolerance. Although she continually has to submit to the pain, it is clear that it is the pain and control she wants.If you are a masochist, you will enjoy this book. If your masochism doesn't require tender words spoken, because they certainly aren't spoken in this story; if pain and the infliction of pain jells your panties, then this is your book baby!It was well written, beautifully written as a matter of fact. I love how this author can tell a story and put the reader right there. But the wonderful use of language didn't prevent me from being thoroughly disappointed, particularly with the way Maura gave up her desire to be loved in leu of her desire to be completely, utterly, ruthlessly controlled. Maura has many moment where she wishes he loved her, where she reminds herself that Simon had been honest and up front that he would never love, had never loved and would not allow himself to love. And yet all of he careful attention to bringing her the pain she desires, checking that she has scrupulously followed every letter of his every law, and makes sure that she is safe, deceives the reader into thinking he is really in love, he just won't admit it.This reader wasn't deceived, and hated the SOB by the end of the book.Perhaps that is the essential message Ms Faulkner wishes to give in all of her stories, certainly the few that I have read. You can't get everything. You want a strong hero who is wealthy, then be prepared to have him wax poetically about his car as he orders you around with impunity. You want a man who will make you feel safe, and keep you under strict control? Fine, just don't expect him to also make you feel loved.I prefer to get the whole package when I'm reading erotica. </p>

 <p> I am very excited to find a new author I like.  I loved this book!  The character's were amazing together (very believable and real) and I was on the edge of my seat.  The only fault I found with this book was for personal reasons...near the end of the book the couple have a very hard session that involves some serious needle play and that was a major turn off for me.  Other than that aspect, I wish more people wrote like Carolyn Faulkner!  Yay! </p>

 <p> This story is about a woman named Maura and a man named Simon who met on the internet. He is an ex-navy seal and comes across as intelligent, protective, caring and YES...Dominant. He is a loner who takes himself very seriously. He expects others to take him seriously as well. Maura is a writer, mostly independent and also intelligent with a sense of humor. She hasn't taken college courses to finish her degree. She is both excited by and has anxiety towards meeting Simon in person. She knows that she is a submissive but isn't sure how much she is comfortable submitting, especially until she knows that she is in the hands of a trustful Dom. She decides to trust Simon but wishes that he was able to show her emotions of love besides just caring. Simon does not believe in love and is honest with her about not wanting that kind of commitment, nor does he want to be married. I believe he was married at one time and the book doesn't really let the reader know what went wrong.Simon pushes her to use her intellect and gives her orders to do so or she will be punished. He makes her go back to college. The same goes for all his other rules. He doesn't allow her to put herself down in anyway, nor is she allowed to keep anything from him. He wants her body to belong to him completely and doesn't tolerate any objections from her. His punishments are servere with intense spankings, canings, hard core anal sex and keeping her in a constant state of sexual arousal which he will sate when he is good and ready.I wish the book was longer and went into more character development. While I enjoyed the read, this writer doesn't even come close to being in the same league as Cherise Sinclair. If you want BDSM with a loving Dom and sub, while he tests her limits in much more creative fashions, then the Master of the Mountain series is the way to fly....no pun intended. You can almost achieve subspace along with the characters. Cherise Sinclair's books sizzle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </p>

 <p> Just finished this book and it is disturbing and powerful.  A no holds barred story that made my heart beat faster and faster.  If I ever thought to dabble in the BDSM world this book took care of that.  I thought Carrie's Story (and sequel) and Obsession: Girl Abducted were powerful and hard hitting, but this story is off the chart.  The tension just never quits. </p>
