 <p> I am not one of these music tech people who is able to talk confidently about bass, ohms and all the rest of the stuff that goes into making a set of headphones.  As a consumer, I am only able to review based on comfort, fit, quality of construction etc.  Sure, the sounds seems pretty good to me, but I simply don't detect nuances the way some people apparently do.These headphones, as noted by other reviewers, are heavier than some, but once you get used to that, they are not uncomfortable, and I do like the secure feel on my head - they don't slide around when I move my head around, and don't fall down over the back of my head as some do.  The ear pieces fit comfortably over my ears, keeping the sound in so that I don't have to have the volume as high - I like that.The headphones feel like they are made of quality materials and well constructed so they won't fall apart, or quit working with in the first few months after purchase.  They are also a pretty blue color :-) </p>

 <p> I have a set of Monster Inspiration noise canceling headphones that I have adored for several months, however in regards to sound quality, these Yamaha PRO 500 beat the Monsters hands down. The sound quality is simply amazing. I have discovered multiple sound and voice nuances that I had never heard before. Additionally, they look great! Wonderful looking design, color and shape; although the fit is a bit heavy, or bulky. I like the dual cable option, and love the packaging.The one nudge I give to the Monsters concerns comfort. I found the Yamaha headphones to be much more comfortable than some of the reviewers have noted, but I must admit after a couple of hours of listening the shape and weight of the headphones begin to become a little uncomfortable. For the price the comfort should be at a higher level. However, even with a slight comfort issue (which might not be the case with other people) for me the sound quality makes these headphones hard to pass up. </p>

 <p> Fantastic Headphones! (although pricey) </p>

 <p> it is a heavy piece of equipment making 10 minutes of use you need a break. it is also unconfortable because the earpads goes until your neck, below your ears, impeding the blood circulation. overall the sound quality is good but misses deep bass. </p>

 <p> The best portable Hi-End portable headphones, use only 23 Ohm of resistance - my Verizon Samsung Galaxy S3 drives those easy, no PowerAmp pre-amp boost is needed. I am comparing to 64 Ohm Sennheiser HD 280 Pro, where I have to boost PowerAmp pre-amp all the way to the top for headphone's soundstage to open up and expand, in other words, to achieve the full covered frequency range of headphones. Yamaha's 23 Ohm of resistance shows all the way - I keep the volume on my Samsung Galaxy S3 connected to Yamaha 500 PRO on the lowest volume level, next to silent - low impedance ensures full loud sound on the low volume level. While listening to Yamaha, PowerAmp pre-amp level is in the middle, bass boost off, treble boost off, equalizer off - the sound in Yams does not need no help. For my Sennheiser HD 280 Pro volume level is 5/8 up, and if I want loud bass, 3/4 up, with the pre-amp level all the way up and bass boost on. While breaking in the Yamahas, on 1/2 the volume I could hear headphones playing loud and clear from across the large living room, 12-15 feet away. 500 PRO are very loud (high sound output, powerful 50mm magnets) headphones.With rich bass, wide stereo field, Yamaha PRO 500 sound is fantastic, coming in your ears, appear in your head out of nowhere - you don't feel "pointed-in-your-eardrums" sound of music, it is rather that wave after wave envelopes your eardrums, making you stop and listen, kinda like then you were a child and you wanted to hear what is coming next in your mother's bedtime story. 500 PROs are that good. Nice array of accessories, nice hard luxury-feel-emitting quality hard carrying case, 2 detachable cables (one 4 meter long for receiver and one shorter with remote for portables. Cables are very high quality, thick, beefy, substantial and light at the same time, with nice silk-screened Yamaha logo, gold-coated jacks, flexible but both cables do not pass thump/sound of touch along to earcups - what I mean is if you touch or bump cables 3-4 inches away from headphone cups, you cannot hear the thump of the sound - cable isolation material is sound-deadening - unlike on many of mine IEMs, where sound of touch or bump will travel all the way to the ears from any distance of the cable being touched or bumped. You can also connect cable to both sides of headphones, and it is normal 3,5 mm cable, so will be easy to replace if needed. I am right handed, so I connect to left side, but if you are leftie, you can connect to the right cable ear-cup, You can also daisy-chain Yams with another pair of headphones, but I haven't tried it yet. Looks like you can change the headband cushion too - I can see 4 little metal screws on the sides of headband - headband is made of some gel-like silicone-filled balloon cushion, triangular in shape, with one of the angles pointing towards the head. My Sennheiser HD 280 Pro headphone's headband is still ok looking after 7 years of constant use. Let's see how Yams will stand the test of time. Headband is durable-looking, like the whole rest of Yams, will probably last, since synthetic silicone is stronger material by itself comparing to leather.NO ANDROID powered remote. Yamaha, are you listening !!!???!!! I paid top buck for 500 PROs, I will pay top buck to get my Android-compatible remote, please make sure I can buy those separately once you produce this Android remote, and please make it happen soon, Thank You, Yamaha !!! :-)))On Android-powered SGS3 the remote's middle button works (play/pause/next track/previous track), volume buttons and mic do not work, if you receive incoming cell phone call, S3 switches the sound to the phone's speaker/mic, thus I do not hear the caller in the headphones and have to take them off. I always think of Thinksounds' Ts-02 mic/remote, where the genius inventor made them (button and Mic) work with Android-powered Samsung Galaxy S3 AND Apple iPhone 5 at the same time, what a genius that guy is ... Even Yamaha couldn't do it ... and Yamaha is the world biggest music equipment creator for pros ...The PRO 500 is an around-the-ear, circum-aural design, very comfortable to skin and ears, though you will feel some slight pressure on the top of your head, seem to only happen during long listening periods. Adjusting the band helps, ear pads are very comfy to ears and plush, so is the underside of headband, overall the around-ear design works just as good for comfort and the overall listening experience as Senns HD 280 PRO larger-more-around-the-ears design, sound isolation is also on par.The materials used and the surface finish on the PRO 500 are top-notch. Mine were chosen in racing blue, and the paint job is NICE - has two-tone, automobile quality clear-coat duo-tone finish, looks super to the eyes, and is durable - I already banged them on my head into the walls and corners (by accident, not intentionally :-)(headphones sit quite high and wide on the head, easy to hit objects with them), and I thought for sure I have made a dent or at least scratched the finish of Yams - but no, even the clear coat lacquer finish didn't show no blemishes after those hard, against the hard-objects knocks.The only con as I see it the Yams are a little heavy cos of high-quality materials used and for being foldable design. Foldable design means there are two metal hinges one inch away from ear cups, those metal hinges allow headphones to collapse into itself in order to make them truly portable and ready to fit into whatever bag you carry with you to go on the road. Nevertheless, in my very humble opinion, high quality dense plastic resin and metal of the frame and hinges material, and portability enhancing duo-fold are all the more important to me, comparing to just being "feather-weight". So no stars detracted.I got mine 500 PROs on the site for the new fresh egg dot com, I am a new egg and the Banker in the real life !!! The deal was too good to pass from financial standpoint, so after having carefully reviewed hours after hours of reviews on Momentums and PRO 500 on Amazon, CNET.US (for 500 PRO review) and CNET.UK (for Senns Momentums review), New fresh eggs and PCMag (Thanks for the excellent review, Mr. Gideon), I bitten the bullet and got 500 PRO. I have 500s' for over a month now, use them daily. Very happy experience. Thank You, Yamaha team, you made my life more bearable with better and nicer sounds of music to my ears !!! :-)In my life I use In-Ear Monitors are Thinksound TS-02 with mic, Klipsch S4-A Image with mic, Klipsch Reference S4 Premium, and Klipsch Image X10 no mic, on the go driven by Samsung GS3 US spec (Qualcomm DAC, not Wolfson DAC, as in International version - I presume 500 PRO will sound even better with Wolfson DAC), at home I listen to Yamaha Pro 500 headphones driven by Yamaha RX-V671 Receiver, Bi-Amp wired with C2G 12AWG speaker wires to Polks Monitor 70s Series II. PC-Build rig is used with Senns 280 Pro (for movies, games, music, all driven by Creative SB ZX sound card with PC headphone amp). I mainly listen to 320 kbps MP3 and Apple or FLAC Lossless (ripped from my CDs) music files stored on 64 Gb Micro SDXC flash on my Samsung Galaxy S3/IPod Classic 5th Gen (bought my 4 IPods when I still respected Apple brand, no more respect for Apple) or on computer hard drive (DLNA to Yamaha receiver).Update 02/23/2013Excellent overall, Depeche Mode's "Wrong" shines, Yams handle complicated and deep bass sound stages with aplomb, with multiple octaves, and all from Samsung Galaxy S3, no headphone amp, just Android software PowerAmp pre-amp on the 60% level. Music feels like you have 3-4 speakers blowing into each ear, separate speaker for bass and low frequencies, separate for high, separate for mids, Yams are very articulate, each dimension of music has its own very separate sound space, and you can hear it clearly very spaced out and coming off a different angle, each instrument separate ...Also, if you have a small head, be advised, these headphones are big. They are even larger than Sennheiser HD 280 PRO's headphones. Initially when I bought headphones, I had them on the smallest setting. Now I extend hinges for 2 or 3 mm (1/16 of an inch) on each retractable hinge side, on my medium-to-large head. The headband is wide too, I guess for extra comfort, even though they sit tightly on my ears. After first month of use headphones loosened up on the sides, becoming more comfortable to wear, and as a result sitting a little bit higher on the head, so I started retracting them 2-3 mm outwards to keep them on my ears. Yams are still comfortable though, for their size and those huge magnets in ear-cups speakers (50 mm diameter magnet on each side, real rare earth metal neodymium magnets). So if they don't feel right away, do not give up, Yams loosen up on the sides and sit higher, so if originally they are too big for you, they may fit in a month of use ...update 03/23/13sides are much looser now, clamping force is on par to worn-out Senns HD 280. Found out due to the differences in music soundscape requirements it helps to adjust amp level in Power Amp Android App - if I want the music to be soft, "Enigmatic", whispering, non-fatiquing for hours to go, so to say the background fone music for studying, I lower the pre-amp level below middle point, somethere to 35-40% of the bar, and music becomes very unobtrusive and relaxing. If I want the music to shine to full potential and the treble/bass to be agressive, and frequency bands booming, for Depeche Mode, LP, Deep Purple, Pendulum, DDT, Cure, Pink Floyd, Adele, anything strong, heavy, loud, powerful, I move pre-amp to 70% or even 80% of the bar. I never have to use 100% pre-amp, like on Senns HD-280, as with Yams music becomes too harsh, they are too powerful to over-amp them,  and yes, you can over-amp Yams with little output of Power Amp on Galaxy S3 :-)... Om some tracks I listen volume gradient one notch up from silent/off - and the music is still loud, but there is no where to go lower. Yams are loud and powerful, but you can control them.update 03/31/13 (also posted on head-fi dott org)Yamaha 500 PRO is not not bass heavy, it is bass powerful though, I can tell it after owning them for 3 months. Bass is very controllable. I listen most of the time to FLAC/AAC/MP3 (128 to 320 kbps) on Samsung Galaxy S3 equipped with PowerAmp music app, PowerAmp has software control of output level of S3 (Pre Amp function). Rarely do I have to lower Pre Amp down or reduce bass freqs to clean bass from mids, because on Yams bass has tonality, octaves, I went to musical school in the past, and can hear the bass "dancing with music" - in other words it flows very much with mids, supporting mids if mid are present during bass frequencies spikes and happens to be delivered at the same time - mids and bass are very separate, and bass bounces below and around mids, it will only blow all frequencies away if you boost the bass or over-equalize it.So, do not be afraid of bass on Yams, but you will enjoy bass on them very much, huge aluminum-alloy metal housing of the drivers make bass very quick and tight, it flashes/spikes/tones up and down instantly, letting you hear all in between the flashes/spikes/tones changes.Now I understand why is the extra weight is on them - it is the price for that exceptional quick-dancing and bouncing bass. I never heard such quick bass before Yams.Also, as per comfort, you will get used to them, and they loose considerably over time (now they slide off my head if I tilt my head forward, just like my Senns 280 HD do :-)P.S. under influence on Yamaha PRO 500 I also got Yamaha EPH-100 SL, I was so impressed with 500 PRO.update 05/01/2013Yamaha PRO 500 headphones had finally "burned-in", after several months of daily use ... the main improvement is the sound ... bass become less isolated and cascading more in tune with lower-mids, vocals came out clearer,subtle highs are now present where I had not heard them before, the very subtle "behind-the-main-sound-stage" tonalities now come through ... Classical music is more defined after break-in, especially highs .. Headphones became very comfortable, clamping force is gone, my ears now adjusted to being slightly bent-in by the top and the bottom of round ear-pads ... and I am very pleased with Yamaha EPH-100 SL in-ear monitor phones as well ... only downside cannot get no COMPLY foams for them, have to use stock flimsies, that provide inferior sound isolation ...01-15-2014 updateYams are holding strong, got Verizon Samsung Galaxy Note 3, now the mic and button work with the phone, can use mic for phone conversations, and button to play/pause/forward songs, or make calls. With Note 3 the quality of sound is much better comparing to S3, DAC is far better, but still not as spacious as listening through Yamaha RX-671 Burr-Brown DAC. </p>

 <p> I do realize that this review runs pretty long so if you do not have the time, here are the basics:Conclusion for the Yamaha Pro500:Very stylish but a bit bulky, I find the Yamaha Pro500 perfect for someone looking for a better alternative than Beats. The bass is very present but not boomy, rather pleasant and punchy. The mids and highs are well present too. I am no expert but I will say that I find them nicely balanced. From the moment I put them on, without any burn-in (or break in) they sounded very pleasant. So I can only hope for it to improve.The overall package makes the price right. The two set of tangle free cables are a must but the remote appears as only compatible with Apple products. You must not have a small head or otherwise be ready to try and find solutions to make the set more comfortable. It may be worth the effort because the sound quality of this set is outstanding. A well-deserved 4 stars (one being removed because of the comfort issue).Pros:- Stylish design- Excellent package- Excellent tangle free cables- Excellent sound- Innovative connectivityCons:- Uncomfortable- Bulky- Need a large head or accept to wear a foam pad on top of your head...Now onto the longer version:As a disclaimer, even if I have performed many headphones reviews over the time and even if I own more than enough, I would like to say that headphones reviews are highly subjective. For those who say that headphones must go to a phase of break-in or burn-in, others suggest that it is more a question of having your brain/ears get accustomed to the headphones. Which one is accurate? Is it possibly both? In any case, I would encourage any reader to take these reviews with a grain of salt. Now, on to the review...My new headphones to review are the Yamaha HPH Pro 500. In order to provide a better review, I will attempt to rate them compared with some other headphones of my collection. A good choice for that would be the ATH-ESW9A which, although now cheaper, were priced at more than $500 originally and are closed, portable as well. I also want to compare them with my Yamaha EPH-100 (In-ears) which I find fantastic and are much cheaper but because of the difference in design, I will only compare them sound wise and more for my own curiosity than anything else.In order to compare effectively the three models, I will use my IPhone unamplified since they are meant for portable use. The tracks I will use are those that I always use when trying to compare headphones, because I love them first but also because I think I know how they should sound and more importantly because they provide a good sample of music genres and tonalities. The tracks will be the following:- Ultrasone Sound test Siley Put short (Jazz, Binaural recording perfect for localization of sounds).- Ultrasone sound test Wellen track 7 (sound of water waves perfect for the head stage definition).- Vivaldi: The 4 seasons - Winter III - Allegro (Classical music).- Frank Sinatra: How insensitive (Jazz, good also for localization of sounds).- Giants of Jazz Play Brassens: Le pornographe (Jazz, excellent also for localization of sounds).- Robin Thicke: Lost Without you (Perfect for male voice testing).- Michael Jackson: Man in the mirror (Perfect for male voice testing and clarity).- Fiona Apple: hot Knife (Perfect for female voice and voice harmonies).- Pink Floyd: Astronomy Domine (Rock and excellent also for the localization of sounds) from the album Piper at the gates of Dawn.- DJ Magic Mike: Feel the Bass (Infra-Bass, enough said...).- Kendrick Lamar: M.A.A.D City (Hip-Hop with some very nice infra bass)- Yello: Planet Dada (Electric Look) (Electronic music with lots of stereo effects).But first, let's start with the non-musical parts:Since I am reviewing the Yamaha PRO 500, let's give a short description:These headphones do look good but are large and heavy. They look somehow enough like the Beats that Yamaha is being sued by them. They come in a large box containing 2 detachable cables, one of 4' with remote and one of about 6' without controls. Both are flat and tangle free, ended with gold plated connectors. To carry them, a large case has been provided. The whole kit breathes quality. The cables can be plugged in either ear and can be daisy chained for a shared musical experience.Comfort: All 2 headphones are over the ears headphones but comfort wise, that's where the resemblance stops. The Yamahas are very large. I have a medium size head and yet, they still kind of float on my head and clamp on my ears. I can forget them temporarily while sitting at my desk but not walking around or even reclining in my chair. In comparison, the ATH, being smaller are a nice fit and are doubtless much more comfortable. I found a solution though. In the box were two foam pads. I am using one to cushion the top of my head and the Pro500 start to feel ok. The problem is that I tend to forget to remove the pad when I take off the Pro500 and they do not always fall right away. So it makes me look a bit stupid. Not an option for travelling.Conclusion: Yamaha: 2nd. ATH: 1st.Portability:The Yamahas are sold with a nice carry case but it is still quite large. In comparison, the ATH are sold with a fake leather pouch which will protect them less but also takes much less space.Conclusion: DrawConstruction quality and appearances:The Yamaha Pro 500 do look good. The pleather of the ear cups feels a bit cheap. The choice of cables is a really great option. Furthermore, it only needs to be attached to one ear. Because of this, it makes the left and right easy to find and the construction feels solid. Another good thing is that there is a remote/mic attached to the small one and the jack is gold plated and L shaped. If you own more than one pair, you can daisy chain them together for simultaneous listening.The ATH look very good too but in another register. Of a much more conventional design, they are built with wooden housings made of African Padauk and lambskin leather. These are luxury items. One drawback is that the cable attaches to both ears at once and it makes it difficult to distinguish the left from the right in darkness.Conclusion: Yamaha Pro 500: 1st. ATH: 2nd.Sound Isolation:Both these headsets are isolating fairly well but neither will provide a perfect isolation for a plane trip or a train ride. In such case, nothing beats IEM with foam like the Yamaha EPH-100 or other good in-ears... As for leaking, both will leak at higher levels, enough to maybe disturb fellow passengers. All 2 are still considered as portable headphones and can be used in reasonably loud environments.Conclusion: Draw.Now, let's come to the real important part of this test: the sound.I am partial to a large head stage and as natural a sound as possible. I like analytical headphones and my rating will be influenced by this factor. I still like good bass (I am a hip-hop fan) but not exaggerated ones...Ok, let's start:- Ultrasone Sound test Siley Put short (Jazz, Binaural recording perfect for localization of sounds).The Yamaha Pro 500 sounds slightly better than the two others but not by much. The Yamaha EPH-100 give a bit more intimate feeling. All 3 offer a superb sound but none will match my reference AKG-Q701 for head-stage.- Ultrasone sound test Wellen track 7 (sound of water waves perfect for the head stage definition).All 3 headphones are giving a nice sense of distance with this track. The water feels like flowing at the shoulder level and in the back for all 3. The water sounds are well restituted. I would still give a slight advantage to the ATH for the better feeling of "being there".- Vivaldi: The 4 seasons - Winter III - Allegro (Classical music).It is so difficult to evaluate headphones when they are of high quality. I would give an edge to the Yamaha EPH-100 for their intimacy with the music. 2nd by a hair would be the Yamaha Pro500 which have nicer bass presence. 3rd are the ATH but I am very subjective here...- Frank Sinatra: How insensitive (Jazz, good also for localization of sounds).This time, the Yamaha Pro 500's bass is too pronounced for my taste. The ATH do show a nice balance between low, mids and highs. Once again, the Yamaha EPH-100 do take the edge for me because of the more intimate sound and a better voice presence of Sinatra.- Giants of Jazz Play Brassens: Le pornographe (Jazz, excellent also for localization of sounds).A great track for the clear separation of instruments; I am starting to get a picture of all 3 headphones. The Yamaha Pro 500 appears as the bassiest but also the clearest of the 3. The most balanced ones are the Yamaha EPH-100 and the ATH are similar to the EPH-100 with slightly less bass. With this track, the Pro 500 are a bit too clear and too aggressive. The guitar on the left does not sound correctly restituted, too shrill. The ATH gave a clean performance but lacking thrill. The best ones for me were again the Yamaha EPH-100.- Robin Thicke: Lost Without you (Perfect for the voice testing and bass punch).All 3 are good at reproducing the male voice but I felt the Yamaha EPH-100 a bit more intimate than the other two. The Yamaha Pro 500 was the bassiest of all 3 but the bass also felt more appropriate.- Michael Jackson: Man in the Mirror (Perfect for the voice testing and clarity).I started with the ATH. Although I could not fail hearing everything, I was left not fully satisfied. Michael's voice was not as nice sounding as usual, maybe slightly thriller. I followed with the EPH-100 without touching the sound level. Right away, the voice sounds better and the bass more present. A better experience overall. Last are the Pro500. They sound slightly clearer than the other two with larger head stage. The bass is indeed well present. I still preferred the EPH-100 at the end.- Fiona Apple (perfect for female voice bass and voice harmonies)This song sounds better on the ATH. There are lots of good bass on this track and the ATH feel closer to the mark than the two others. Second one would be the Yamaha EPH100. Last are the Yamaha Pro 500 because of slightly too much bass.- Pink Floyd: Astronomy Domine (Rock and excellent also for the localization of sounds).All 3 restituted the track fairly well. Small noticeable differences where in the soundstage. The Pro500 felt the narrowest. The largest were maybe the ATH but not by much as compared to the EPH-100.- DJ Magic Mike: Feel the Bass (Infra-Bass, enough said...)The infra-bass is maybe the most difficult sound for any speaker to reproduce. I decided to try it with max IPhone volume. All 3 deliver well with the Bass. I am very impressed however that the In-ear could deliver as good as the two others. The Pro were the loudest and the cups started making my ears tingle with the pressure. I could feel the diaphragms move, it was quite pleasant. No winner here. They all pass with flying colors.- Kendrick Lamar: M.A.A.D City (Hip-Hop with some very nice infra bass).I kind of try finding any reason to listen to this track. So three times in a row with three excellent headset is a treat. I started with the EPH-100 and nothing bad to say, excellent phat bass (lots of it in this track), good sound localization, groovy... Next, the ATH deliver a very solid performance too. The Pro500 do sound very good too, with the mids maybe more recessed than the other two. It gives an airier delivery to the track.- Yello: Planet Dada (Electric Look) (Electronic music with lots of stereo effects).Starting with the Pro500 which prove excellent with electronic music; The stereo effects are well restituted. A good performance overall. The ATH are a little bit less bright but deliver a good performance too. The Yamaha EPH-100 are the best in my opinion. They seem to top the other two in very slight but present ways.Conclusion for the sound comparison:All three headsets in competition are excellent in their own ways. I would easily use any of them on an everyday basis but the Yamaha EPH-100 would be my favorite for all ranges of uses. When travelling, I would prefer the ATH to the Yamaha Pro500 because it is way more comfortable. At home it would be the reverse. I cannot help be amazed that the smallest of the three could beat the other two in sound comparison but it does and it is no small feat. Sound wise, the Pro500 come second with the ATH-ESW9 a close third.Price wise, the cheapest are the EPH-100 a less than half the price of the Yamaha Pro500. Middle range are the ATH price wise. The EPH-100 feel like the real deal here.I must add that I compared unbroken Pro500 against two headsets I constantly use and that must have more than 400 hours of listening each. If ever my rating was to change, I would indeed come back and update this review.Conclusion for the Yamaha Pro500:Very stylish but a bit bulky, I find the Yamaha Pro500 perfect for someone looking for a better alternative than Beats. The bass is very present but not boomy, rather pleasant and punchy. The mids and highs are well present too. I am no expert but I will say that I find them nicely balanced. From the moment I put them on, without any burn-in (or break in) they sounded very pleasant. So I can only hope for it to improve.The overall package makes the price right. The two set of tangle free cables are a must but the remote appears as only compatible with Apple products. You must not have a small head or otherwise be ready to try and find solutions to make the set more comfortable. It may be worth the effort because the sound quality of this set is outstanding. A well-deserved 4 stars (one being removed because of the comfort issue).Pros:- Stylish design- Excellent package- Excellent tangle free cables- Excellent sound- Innovative connectivityCons:- Uncomfortable- Bulky- Need a large head or accept to wear a foam pad on top of your head...Update 04/04/2013I have had those for a while now and I thought it would be time to provide some feedback.For whatever reason, I got eventually used to the comfort (or lack of) provided. These headphones are not a problem anymore for me to wear.Sound wise, still amazing. I love these and how punchy they are.Quality wise, no ptoblem at all. Nothing moved, they still look as good as on first day.A definite good buy! I am cranking them up to 5 stars now. </p>

 <p> First let me say that this headphone originally hit the street for $399.Now about the Yamaha Pro 500's sound.Big, bold, full, detailed, and rich.It DOES have extended bass, YES&lt; but its generaly  balanced with  full mids and trebles.Overall, sonically, the sound is dynamic and slightly warm, owing to its punched mids and extended bass response.It has a wide soundstage and overall translates music  heard through it =  quite musical.Its a $260  bargain.This headphone offers just enough articulation to let you dissect the music, or, it allows you to just enjoy listening.It has not been engineered to offer a "V" shaped EQ with scooped mids, therefore its not for treble heads or those who prefer the AKG 7 series sound.Now, are there any  real issues with it?Yep, of course.Its not the last word in comfort on your head.Id rate it as below average in comfort as it is a bit too tight on the ears and its a bit heavy, tho nothing like the HIFi Man stuff. .This is not a headphone that disappears when you wear it., however, other then this one negative caveat, this is a fine sounding gear for the money. </p>

 <p> Headphones are increasingly becoming a genre or niche product. Companies are now marketing their headphones for specific segments of the population: they are carefully targeting a wide demographic range of music listeners from the so-called "audiophool" to the so-called audiophile. The current champion of street-level headphones seems to beBeats Solo HD On-Ear Headphone (Black)which are a heavily bass biased headphone largely aimed at a youth market that listens primarily to popular music in lossy formats like mp3. TheYamaha PRO 500 High-Fidelity Premium Over-Ear Headphones (Racing Blue), especially in their Racing Blue color, resemble these in looks but are markedly superior to them in sound. I deliberately tested the Yamaha PRO 500 headphones against phones entirely different in design and engineering philosophy: Sennheiser HD 700s, Sennheiser HD 600s and Shure SRH1840s. All of these test headphones are considered of audiophile quality but have a significantly higher impedance than the Yamahas and are essentially designed for listening to complex acoustic music like Jazz and Classical. In other words, the test headphones are nearly polar opposites of the Yamahas. I expected them to proverbially "wipe the floor" with the Pro 500s. However, my listening comparison produced a stunning result: the Yamahas more-than held their own in terms of producing music that sounded realistically well-defined, powerfully rich and full, and extremely spacious with a wide soundstage. They even bested all three audiophile headphones in one very crucial aspect, which I will get to shortly. I listened to the test headphones as well as the Pro 500s plugged into three different headphone amps: the Grace Design m903, the TEAC HA-501, and the FiiO E9 with an E7 USB module attached. I then listened to all four headphones plugged directly into an iPod and an iPad playing Apple lossless music files without benefit of an amplifier.Plugging the PRO 500s into each of the three headphone amps produced sound that had a pronounced V-shape: the bass was definitely accentuated, the treble rather less so, and the mid-range was recessed to a moderate degree. The music sounded clear and forceful but with a slightly 2-dimensional quality due to the hesitant mid-range. There was no significant qualitative difference in the audio signature produced by the PRO 500s when plugged into any of the three headphone amps: two of which are audiophile grade and the third renowned for producing solid sound at a moderate cost. The musical output of the PRO 500s was essentially the same for each of the three. What was surprising was the result produced by plugging the PRO 500s directly into an iPod or iPad: the music was spacious and transparent, warm and slightly on the dark side with a generous sound stage and a liquid, plush tone. What was even more surprising was that the audio produced by the PRO 500s had lost most of that initial V-shaped quality. It seemed as if the music had really blossomed, although there was some instrumental clumping in the center, which is not uncommon with many closed-back headphones. I played Jazz, Rock (classic and hard), Blues, Folk, and all of them were reproduced superbly. The one genre that suffered slightly in comparison was Classical: the Pro 500s are a bit less successful as a Classical Music headphone. Yamaha conspicuously leaves that genre off its list on the headphone's box. The PRO 500s are probably not neutral enough for most Classical Music. If you listen to Classical predominantly, then these headphones might not be your first choice. However, because the PRO 500s have such a warm-hued, vibrant sound, some listeners may still find them a good match for Classical music, despite their lack of neutrality. Ultimately, musical tastes and headphone preferences are subjective.The PRO 500s have a low 23 ohm impedance, allowing them to be easily driven by an iPod or iPad. They always sound as if they have power to spare: which is the source of music that is loud and full with deep, rich bass, and a spacious well-defined soundstage, despite the 500s being closed-back headphones. When I tried this direct iPod/iPad connection with the audiophile grade headphones, with their much higher impedance levels, they sounded weak and thin by comparison. Of course, once plugged into any of the three headphone amps, the audiophile grade headphones regained their superiority of musical reproduction. The Yamahas reverted to being a bit less spatially accurate and distinctly more tonally "colored", its V-shaped audio spectrum producing a slightly 2-dimensional musical quality once again. The PRO 500s are designed to be used as portable headphones (they fold quickly and neatly) and they are easily the finest that I've yet heard amongst headphones answering to that description.The PRO 500s are sturdily constructed with aluminum alloy earcups, metal frame, and cushioned ear pads. They feature an over ear design and are closed-back so that their noise isolation is quite good: barely any external sound leaked through those aluminum alloy earcups. But the Pro 500s are heavy, weighing 13 oz. without the cable (of which there are two: a detachable 10 foot flat cable and a 4 foot cable designed specifically for iPod use). That weight, along with an earcup design that is just a bit too small for some heads, as well as a strong clamping force, make these headphones uncomfortable for some users after an hour or two. I had to switch phones after a couple of CDs just to rest my tender ears. This ergonomic issue must be revisited by Yamaha.The bottom line is that the Yamaha PRO 500s are probably the finest sounding portable headphones currently available, with a vibrant iPod/iPad sound. They are a lot of fun to listen to. They can be used with all genres of music with one possible exception: their lack of neutrality and their warm, creamy, and slightly dark-hued tone may be inappropriate for many Classical music listeners. They do not require a headphone amp, nor is one recommended. The PRO 500s sound best when plugged directly into a portable player. They are very comfortable on small and average size heads but for those folks with larger craniums and ears the PRO 500s become uncomfortable after an hour or two. I enjoy their sound so much I would like to keep listening but I am inevitably forced to quit. Amongst portable headphones the Yamaha PRO 500s are pretty much the current state-of-the-art and are easily recommended as long as you observe the aforementioned caveats. </p>

 <p> *****I have been an audiophile for at least three decades.  I care about good music sound.  I have owned perhaps half a dozen high-quality headphones over those years, and a good dozen more that were of lesser quality.  I might not be an expert in comparing headphones, but I am certainly not a novice.If you want a high-quality pair of circumaural headphones, the kind that entirely surrounds all of both of your ears and thus gives you the best possible sound and the best possible rejection of outside noise, this product, Yamaha PRO 500 High-Fidelity Premium Over-Ear Headphones (Racing Blue), even at its price, is worth five stars.*****If you want a pair of headphones that you can pretty much hear through, such as when you're walking your dog and you stumble upon a person coming the other way who says something, you can get closer and hear what that person is saying even if you're still wearing your headphones and whom you plan to walk by rather than slowing down for, you should subtract a star, because these headphones block out more sound than that.  But I'm not going to.If you want a pair of headphones you can easily, casually, lightly, one-handedly flick off your head and down onto your neck so you can hear perfectly well whatever that other dog owner is saying, you should subtract a star, because these babies are heavy and well-clamped to your head.  But I'm not going to.*****If you want a pair of headphones that are not a strking shade of blue then you should subtract a star, but I'm not going to.If you do not want a pair of headphones that delivers high fidelity to the original music as intended by the artists and the engineers who recorded and mixed it, with all the dynamic range (from loudest to softest) as well as all almost all of the frequency range (from almost the lowest bass to highest treble), you should subtract a star.  But I am most certainly not going to.*****By way of going beyond the usual testing, I offer these observations regarding not just the Racing Blue but any color of the Yamaha PRO 500 High-Fidelity Premium Over-Ear Headphones.-- Not suitable as a brassiere for any species of kangaroo or ungulate.  (Too small.)  Not suitable as a brassiere for any species of hamster or sparrow.  (Too big.)-- Not waterproof, at least not if accidentally dunking them headfirst into the bottom of a big vat of apple cider means anything.-- For as long as I've owned this exact pair of headphones, they have never spontaneously exploded.I neither add nor subtract any stars for the foregoing, so I'm stuck at five.*****These are high-quality headphones at an acceptable price for those who can hear the differences.  For those who can't, they are too good. </p>

 <p> I personally hate the Beats headphones because they are overpriced. However, I have to admit that they have the best design on the headphones market. One more thing, the built quality of Beats headphones aren't up to the hype. So, Yamaha decide to make a headphones that look like the Beats but sound like heaven. Yamaha also improves the built quality of the headphones and make it somewhat "adequate" to the price tag. I am no audiophile nor musician but I've used many headphones and in term of sound quality, this one is one of the best. For an average user, you don't even need to worry about the sound quality. Put these on, and you'll be on music heaven (plus you'll draw a lot of attentions). Built quality is excellent (compare to the Beats). The headphones seem very durable. Detachable cable is always a nice feature to have. I'm 5'7 and I have small-medium ears, and I don't feel any discomfort wearing these. I think as long as you don't have huge ears, you should be okay. However, the price tag is intimidating. If you want top of the line sound quality with the sexy design, this is for you. If you only care about sound quality, you have many options at cheaper price. If you only care about the look, then go with the Beats. </p>

 <p> I'm probably squandering the potential of these beauties, but I honestly only ever use them in conjunction with an MP3 player, or to listen to content on a computer. That in mind, here's my experience:The sound is incredible. It cancels out everything except the song you're listening to (and this is one impressive feat given my circumstances.) It's as good as you can get without actually seeing a live performance.They are surprisingly light, with padding around the ears and along the band, which makes them comfortable to wear for extended periods. Some premium headphones have been heavy enough to cause aches in the past; the padding on others became sticky and hot after a while, or sort of "deflated." I haven't encountered any of those issues with these headphones, and I use them all the time.These are definitely worth the investment, and highly recommended. </p>

 <p> I'm no audiophile or musician but I can appreciate superb sound quality and a comfortable headset when they come my way.With the Yamaha PRO 500's I discovered subtle sounds within music pieces I had never been able to catch before. That might be a bad thing for some, but I was quite awed with how much more of the subtle stuff I was getting. I love that they do a great job of canceling outside noise without being so bad I couldn't catch the phone ringing. If you want a headset that delivers exceptional audio and keeps you from being inundated with outside noise you will love these.As far as quality of build goes these are gorgeous. I love that I could use the cable on either side, left or right. The only flaw I find in the cable is that the controls are about a foot higher than I would prefer, it's a personal preference as I primarily use these for watching media on my iPad and hate having to reach up to my neck to adjust the volume. In the past I've had over-the-ear headsets (non-premium ones) that were painfully tight but these do lean toward the large size. At lowest extension they're just a little loose on my skull. If you have a big head and a tough time finding a comfortable fit these are one to put your money into.Overall, I can't yet give a fair estimation of the long-term durability of the Yamaha PRO 500's but mine have taken a couple of falls onto the floor, stairs, and coffee table without a scratch or any issue. I would recommend these to anyone--audiophile or not--who wants to invest in a comfortable headset with a quality build, superb sound quality, and an overall great product for the money. </p>

 <p> Build Quality:  1/2 step above beats... sad to say.Isolation:  Rather good, enough to cover most traffic and general out and about noise.  Not what I'd want for Tube or long flights but as good as any over the ear I've tried. So a good option if you can't do IEM's.Comfort/Fit:  Errrr a bit so so.  Firstly they are huge, they fit me fine with the headband at its minimum size, extended they get comedy huge.  Then the ear cups were a tiny fraction too small, they just didn't quite make it over my ears entirely and so exerted a  bit of pressure around the top and bottom.  These never got painful but it was bothersome.  Also they have massive clamping force and that got tiring on the back of my jaw, again not painful but it was a relief to take them off after a few hours.  Granted you need that clamping force to keep them on if you're out and about so it's all a bit of a trade off.Aesthetics:  Well they look nicer in the flesh but I'm still not wildly taken by them, maybe I'd have liked the black more?  It's all just a bit flashy and that's just not me but to each their own.Sound:  There is no mistake that these are aimed at the consumer and not the actual professional market despite their name.  (Seriously, change the name Yamaha.) These have a pretty dramatic sound signature that's pretty V shaped, the bass in particular is rather boosted.  The quantity isn't ridiculous but still rather too much.  The quality though is awesome, depth is good being closed but what shines is the power.  The skull crushing power and yet with such swift agility and the impact is outstanding.  Mids too quality wise are excellent, a touch dry for a Yamaha but so open, airy and sooooooooo clear for a closed headphone.  The highs are just as good too, they extend well and move like lightning.  For a closed headphone it really is convincing is providing air and openness.  Overall its speed, power and enthusiasm make for a really dramatic and compelling sound.  Sure it's a bit tiring on my ear for listening for too long but it's deeply engaging.  The driver in these is a wonder, even more so that it can do so much even being driven out of poor sources like a phone.  Still they can do rather better if you power them well; I'd strongly advise you to do so if you buy a set.Value:  Expensive but top class sound quality if you want a "consumer" orientated sound signature.  Compared with others in the class these slaughter the Beats I've heard.Pro's:  Energy, Enthusiasm, Drama, BASS!!!!! Treble, ClarityCon's:  Too over dramatic and V shaped, aurally and physically tiring. </p>

 <p> I'll be comparing these toBeats Studio Over-Ear Headphone (Blue). I've tried tons of other headphones and nothing beat the Beats Studio's until these Yamaha's! They are heavier than the beats but only a little. The color of the metallic blue is awesome and the photos on amazon doesn't do them justice. The ear cups are slightly larger than the beats also and really fit over your entire ear much better than the beats do (at least they do for me). I don't have huge ears but mine do fit inside the ear cups whereas on the Beats don't and after an hour the Beats hurt my ears from the pressure of their tight fit. I'm being a bit critical on a few things in this review so please know that some of my negatives for others may be no big deal.I took off one star because i feel that the beats are still more comfortable even though they too hurt after awhile. The yamaha's push against you just under your ear lobe against your upper jaw/neck.  After a while it became a bit uncomfortable. Other reviewers also complained about this fit, i think its just the design of them as they have a very circular shape to them. They may loosen up in time and use so we'll see.The sound definitely is more robust all around especially in the lows and bass. I had tested the Yamaha's and the Beats using the same songs and while the Beats were super close, I still could hear crisper/deeper bass and mid's that were just a bit lower in the Beats. Don't get me wrong, the beats were super close, i'm being very critical with the test.  The sound canceling on the beats is a bit better but its probably because they need a battery whereas the Yamaha's don't need a battery. The sound from the Yamaha's in my opinion overall is much more pleasing then my favorite Beats that I love so much. I also have the 50 Cent headphonesSTREET by 50 Cent Wired Over-Ear Headphones - Blue by SMS Audioand ranking them i'd say that the Yamaha is #1, Beats are #2 and 50 Cent are #3 in terms of sound. (when comparing those 3 headphones together)The box comes with 3 adapters, one is the cable for iPhone, iPad, iPod and the other is for regular use and also there's a 1/4 (mini to quarter inch) jack. On the yamaha's, you have the option of having the plug on either the L or R sides of the ear cups. You also get a nice case that the headphones fold up into along with a microfiber cloth. The case has a nice little fabric handle on the back side making carrying easier as well as a clip.The price is a bit high coming in at $399. (at time of review) The beats are $299 and the 50 Cent are only $125. So depending on your budget you have options. In my opinion its between the Yamaha's and the Beats as the 50 Cents really didn't get close enough sound wise to compare them with the others. For me, i'd rather have better sound but wish the yamaha's were a bit more comfortable so for some the Beats may be better for most people both in price and comfort. But i'm really being critical about things. </p>

 <p> The Einstein comparison used is inaccurate, as the Dre Beats headphones are not exactly brilliant, at least not in terms of sound quality. They are perhaps brilliant in terms of their success as a product and in terms of getting ordinary non-audiophile consumers to drop three bills on headphones that will be mainly used with portable MP3 players. The problem with the Beats is simply that they don't sound too good objectively. My suspicion is that most Beats buyers have only heard Apple earbuds and $30 Sony Best Buy cheapies, and that therefore the simply average sound quality of the Beats compared to their low SQ expectations coming from the lower end of the market, combined with subjective lifestyle image marketing, is what compels most Beats purchases. I am happy to report that the Yamaha Pro 500 does everything the Beats does in terms of build quality and aesthetics (indeed, even to the point of shameless imitation, more later) and far exceeds what the Beats can do in terms of sound reproduction. Indeed, the Pro 500s were so impressive that I would say anyone not walking the audiophile path of pain who can pay the price for these ought to buy them and be happy with them as the best currently available non-audiophile grade headphones available.First, what is an audiophile headphone? To me this designation means three things: clarity, detail, and accuracy to the original recording. The Pro 500s are a wonder in terms of clarity and detail, but they have a bass boost in the low end that diminishes accuracy objectively. Subjectively, the bass boost sounds fine, and even some experts feel that a low end boost of some degree makes headphones sound better and more enjoyable. (The low freq impact from good speakers is missing in headphones, says the theory, so a bit of bass boost in phones brings this feeling back.) A true audiophile headphone usually sounds bass shy to the listener (e.g. AKG 550s or 701) and / or only sounds good with massive amplification provided by a dedicated balanced headphone amplifier (e.g. Sennheiser HD 600, 650, 700). The lack of low end oomph (or indeed any oomph at all for most of these phones) when using them with minimally powered portables like Touch Ipods or cell phones means that audiophiles will not be buying something like the Pro 500, unless they are looking for something "fun" to use with their portable devices.Assuming you can live with a low end freq boost, you will be very happy with the Pro 500s. Nothing sounds bad with these phones; death metal grunts in older Opeth albums become intelligible, you can hear each string get plucked in Rodrigo y Gabriel albums, location details in Kind of Blue are spot on. In terms of balance, detail, and clarity, the Pro 500s easily trounce the ATH M50s and Shure 440s, two of my favorite full size headphones. Other "lifestyle" headphones I have like the B&W; P5 and Phiaton MS 400 are also left far in the dust. The even pricier Sennheiser Momentum sounds like it is a generation or two behind the Pros in driver technology. Bass heavy music like electronica or downtempo sounds full and rich, yet with no loss of detail. Special note has to be made of the great sounds that "modern" metal generates from these phones: bands like Agalloch and Opeth can sound like congested noise even in good quality cans, yet the Pro 500s separate and clarify the textures. I also listened to a lot of classical piano with these, and everything from Alkan to Bartok sounds pretty amazing. Sound stage is surprisingly wide, given that these are closed phones, and is easily as good as the open designed Senn HD 595s and / or the closed AKG K550s. These are probably the best example of a utility infielder that I've found in the land of headphones, though at the price point this is not too amazing.No amplifier is needed. A FiIo E10 and Headroom Little Amp added nothing much to these phones other than volume, which is definitely not a deficiency in the first place. Even a Samsung Gal III could drive these to overly loud levels on 3/4s of device volume.As far as musical considerations go, who shouldn't buy these? If you are getting these mainly for pop, you may want to look at something cheaper that can do that relatively easy lifting sort of job; these tend to be overkill. Adele and Amy Winehouse sounded great on these, but no more great than they sounded on Sony ZX700s or ATH M50s which are a third of the price. Similarly, value conscious shoppers should also hesitate; though these phones sound significantly better than the SRH 440s or ATH M50s, it would be hard for me to say they sound more than 300% better, which is the actual price difference. Professionals in a studio (ironically enough) will probably want to get something more neutral in tone. Finally, if sound is a secondary concern, and you really want the Beats to make a lifestyle statement, the derivative styling of the Pro 500s and the fact these are not by Dre will probably already have discouraged you.It should also be mentioned that, unlike Beats, there is no active noise cancellation feature here. I won't go into the details, but IMO, this is a good thing as noise cancellation is 1) ineffectual in high noise situations, 2) adds cost (batteries), weight, and complexity to the design, and also usually affects the sound quality of what you're listening to. Balanced armature canal phones are a better bet for frequent flyers. But if you want a full sized headphone, the Pro 500s isolate sound very well, but in a physical way, not with any active circuits.What are some non-sound quality related considerations here? First, styling: Yamaha has rather shamelessly copied the Beats physical appearance and design, adding a "distinctive" Yamaha tuning fork logo as the only significant differentiation. Build quality and materials are high quality, though also highly derivative. Though the phones feel sturdy and look sharp, I am not entirely happy with Yamaha's path here. First, the Beats are not exactly the world's best headphone design. If you've ever seen older Beats, they tend to droop, creak, and eventually break. There is a lot of weight at the end of a smallish hinge that often is snapped open with too much force. The Beats and the Pro 500s need to be gently handled by users in the long run if you want them to last well past the warranty period. Plus the Pro 500s do not fold flat, so (like the Beats) the carrying case Yamaha supplies is only slightly smaller and less bulky than a bowling ball in a case. The case is sturdy and well-made, but good luck fitting anything else in your carry-on!Problem two with the "me-too" design is the fact that it subtly undermines what Yamaha has achieved here. These are great sounding headphones that are also well made - couldn't Team Yamaha come up with a less derivative physical design? I'm not taking any points off for this, as it is a pretty subjective aspect of the design. Certainly if the only thing you want from a headphone is the Beats logo, these are already off your radar. If you want something that fools folks from a moderate observation distance, these will do. And, most important to me, if you want something that sounds like its worth what you paid for it, the Pro 500s are also way ahead of the game.Mixed good news / bad news is the size of the phones. My somewhat largish cranium and ears have recently felt like Gulliver when trying on cans like the V-Moda M80 and Sennheiser Momentum. The Pro 500s in comparison make my head seem teeny, as they only need about 25% extension to comfortably fit my head. Average sized heads may well get by with no extension at all needed on the headband. And small heads may find these phones are just too big. The phones are also very heavy. The top padding is very comfy, and materials used are mainly metal, including aluminum housings for the drivers.My most significant concern here is comfort, at least during the initial period of wear. In the first few days of use, these felt as if I had strapped two cups on either side of my head. Very firm and tight grip, combined with hard relatively non-supple pads. The isolation was excellent, beating the Senn HD280 and ATH M50s (my former full size headphone isolation champs) but I needed to frequently adjust the cans and take a rest every half hour or so. The pads softened and the grip became more tolerable after about a week, but the sensitive may have a hard time enduring the break in period. After two weeks of use, the phones are now reasonably comfy and I can wear them for 2 hours or more without discomfort. Closed design, meaning they may get a bit hot in the summer, but plenty of room for my larger ears inside the cups. Virtually all users other than Dumbo will find these to be circumaural (i.e. the cups fit around the ears, not on top of them.)Yamaha, oddly enough for a professional audio equipment maker, does not provide any actual tech stats on the product in the entirely superfluous manual or on the largish packaging. Per the website: drivers are 50mm, impedance is 23 ohms, sensitivity 106 dB, (these can get very loud very easily), weight is 13 ozs. (369 g). Accessories are what you would expect at the price point: two good quality detachable flat cables that can be plugged into either side of the frame, one short 4 ft with playback controls for Apple devices on it (also works as pause / play only control for Android devices) with L plug and one longer cable, 10 ft, no controls, I plug. One year warranty.Final non-SQ issue: the price point! Are these worth 33% more than the Beats? I think so - the level of detail and extremely pleasing balance (to me) is exceptional and the materials feel sturdy and premium. If you are willing to buy Beats at their usual price, at least do a comparison between these and the Pro 500s and see if you can hear the difference; I could! But then as I say above, depends on what you're listening to. Jay Z or Justin Bieber will sound about the same on either set of phones, so if that's all you listen to, you may not have to spend quite so much to get a good audio experience. However, genre diverse listeners and / or demanding single genre enthusiasts (i.e. classical, jazz) may find that a much cheaper set of cans like the Audio Technica M50s deliver a goodly percentage of the sound of the Pro 500s at a much lower price point. But if you have four bills worth of disposable audio budget, I think you will find these to be a very worthwhile investment.All in all, 5 star sound. No stars deducted for shamelessly derivative styling. Quarter star off for large size / bulk, and quarter star off for possible long term wear and tear issues due to hinge lash issue. Quarter star off for agonizing vise-like grip out of the box. And quarter star off for relatively low value ratio. A solid four stars, though smaller heads may want to try before buying and all users will have to endure a relatively brief though painful break in period, so the morbidly sensitive need not apply. </p>
