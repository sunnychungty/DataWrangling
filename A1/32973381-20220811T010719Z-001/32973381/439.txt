 <p> I highly recommend this historical romance.This romantic story set in Pennsylvania after the Civil War is about a boy and girl who form a strong bond as children only to grow up in a time of impending war that complicates their intense relationship nearly beyond repair.The story opens when, after four years away, Emily Winters returns to her home town to attend her father's funeral. Not only must she face old gossip, she must also face Ross Gallagher, the love of her life who has just returned home from the war.Ross and Emily have a pile of old hurts and new conflicts to sort out if they are to restore their special friendship, not the least of which is the irresistible physical attraction that has thrown them disastrously off course in the past.ALWAYS is perfect for readers of sensual small town historical romance, </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> Friends since early youth, Ross & Emily had a shaky beginning. They became blood brother and sister - a pact they saw differently but binding just the same. Just months before Ross left to join the Civil War, they had a disagreement that caused a wedge in their friendship. Soon after joining, Ross was reported dead. Emily left town to live with an aunt in Baltimore. Upon returning to town for her beloved father's funeral, Emily discovers Ross is alive. Many complications threaten to totally sever their friendship. Will they be able to establish a friendship again or will their lives turn in different directions.This is a love story which becomes very complicated and involves the love and paths of several others.So often in live choices cause our paths to turn turn different directions that are regrettable but to change directions often affect others lives and happiness. This is one of those tales.It was well-written but, at times, repetitive. The author, however, managed to keep the intrigue throughout the story. The detailed sex scenes were unnecessary and unappreciated. Although during that time period, there were sexual indiscretions, the verbally detailed experience seems out of context. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Always - Good historical romance except for sex scenes </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> After a four-year absence, Emily Winters returns to her hometown of Lancaster Pennsylvania in 1865 after her father's death, and she's very surprised to find her childhood friend Ross Gallagher alive and well (he'd been reported as dead during the war). Even more surprising is that no one, not even her sister, bothered to write and tell her Ross was alive. Emily soon involves herself in trying to revive her father's failed printing/newspaper operation, setting her at odds with Ross, who works for  the #1 newspaper in town, and he's also engaged to the boss's snotty daughter.That's the basics, and I don't want to reveal more. It's apparent from the first that Ross and Emily have a Big Secret, but the author takes her time to unravel it all with flashbacks to their childhood and what led up to Emily cutting off contact with Ross and moving away. There's also a mystery or two to solve as Emily digs into the reasons why her father's business failed. This was  a quick easy read, Emily and Ross were a good solid pair to root for. This was originally published in 1996 under the title Forever and Always, and a huge thumbs up for getting it out on Kindle with no formatting errors or typos (well, there was one typo I spotted, but so minor it's not worth a mention). 3.5/5 stars and I will be reading more from this author. </p>

 <p> AlwaysThis was a sweet romance. It was free when I down loaded it. There weren't any surprises or anything special about this story. But the lead characters were well developed. I would probably read other books by this author. </p>

 <p> I was beginning to give up hope of finding a book worthy of 5 stars.  This book definitely earned all of them.  Very well written and kept me engaged until the very end. Sweet story of childhood friends who both endure hardships and discover love.  Must read!  I'm downloading the author's other books now. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> This book had some enjoyable moments but I felt that it was a little too wordy for me, too many pages without anyone talking, too much page skimming for me, looking for someone to say something. I find that to be the case in  a lot of books. The hero and the heroine were terrific and the storyline was good.Would I recommmend it? Yes, I would. Some readers like wordy and lots of pages with no one speaking. I just don't happened to be one of them.And for those of you who don't like sex in your books I still think you'd like this. The author added sex that is sweet, without being overly descriptive.I would definately read this author again. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Good..But not great.. 3 1/2 stars </p>
