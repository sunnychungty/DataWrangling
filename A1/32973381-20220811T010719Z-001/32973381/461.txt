 <p> This book was okay, but I almost feel like I was cheated out of reading a great book and stuck with this instead. The author needs to find an editor before publishing anything else. It really detracts from the reading </p>

 <p> Written by BluebellOriginally posted on confessionsfromromaholics dot comARC provided kindly by Author for reviewing purposesMaya Saber is a saber tooth tiger on a mission. Her mission is to find, rescue, and offer shelter to any female feline shifter in trouble. Some of those she has rescued she has brought into her family and treats them like they are sisters. When Maya was younger, she watched as her whole family was brutally murdered and she was taken captive and raped and beaten. Now she is out for revenge and she wants the man who destroyed her family to die by her hand. What she she doesn't know is that the man she believes killed her family was dead long before her family was butchered. Maya is shocked to discover that she has not one mate but three and all three are Cometedge warriors who want to wrap her in cotton and keep her safe.Akaos Featherstone is a Cometedge who is very powerful and he, too, is on a mission: he wishes to find and kill the man who is misusing his gifts and creating havoc on Earth. Akaos has tracked him to Earth, now he just has to find him--something that should be fairly easy for one with his powers but things become a whole lot more complicated when he discovers his mate torn between protecting a mate who doesn't believe she needs his protection and finding and killing the man his mate has sworn to see die at her own hand.Trinity Blacio has long been a favorite of mine her Running In Fear series was phenomenal and I foresee this story being huge too.The chemistry between Maya and Akaos was sizzling. Warden needs Maya to accept him possibly more than either Akaos or Tesuss and he has a lot of trouble controlling his possessiveness around her, which is a big turn off for Maya. The last thing she needs is not one but three dominant males in her life trying to stop her from getting her revenge. When the men offer to take down her enemy for her , it just makes her mad as she is strong willed and independent in her own right. However, when her enemy is revealed to be a lot more than she bargained for, she accepts the help of her mates but makes them promise not to expect her to totally back down.I loved this book; it has enough shifters and vampires to thrill any paranormal reader and those of us that loved Running in Fear will no doubt follow this series with the same passion. For me, the plot started a little slow and I really didn't get fully engrossed until the third chapter but as soon as I was hooked I was really hooked and couldn't put my ereader down till I was done. Now I'm waiting for book two, so here's hoping Ms. Blacio writes fast as I've got a feeling that Maya's daughter Dee is about to give her mates a run for their money in book two. </p>

 <p> This is a great start to the series.  How can you not love a book about vampires and shifters?  Maya is a strong and capable saber tooth tiger that has taken care of her people for a long time.  She has spent 500 years searching and rescuing her people and tracking down the enemy that destroyed her family.  The chemistry between Maya ad Akaos was immediate and hot.  Suddenly Maya finds herself with three mates and it is hard for her to give up control and allow them to protect her, and track down her enemy.  There are a few sex scenes which involve a little light BDSM which are very hot.  I highly recommend this book and I am looking forward to the second book in the series. </p>

 <p> I enjoyed this story very much.  The sex was hot! I like the lead characters.  The story line is good and I want to read the next one.The one criticism I have  is someone needs to do some serious editing. I would be happy to do it!  There are lots of typos and wrong word choices (dinner vs diner) that for the most part I could overlook, but in some parts it was so messed up I had to read the page a few times to figure out what it should say.Overall, I would recommend, but only if you aren't someone who gets tied down with the grammar or typos!  ENJOY! </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> I give this 3.5 stars </p>

 <p> Was it good?? yes & no..the jury is still out on it. I will say this much, the author has a very inventive imagination for sure. I enjoy BDSM books & menage that doesnt bug me...some of the dom stuff did bug me...in the bedroom is one thing, but out of it?? uhhh I guess im just too bitchy & alpha myself to visualize that without wanting to commit bodily harm LOL! the book was just different, I cant say it didnt keep my attention because it did..but just not my normal cuppa tea. will I buy the next book?? maybe! I did love the h daughter! shes more bitchy LOL!!! so I may see where that one leads...if the males get to the point of sayin YOUR GETTIN BENT over my KNEE steadily like the first book? then it will be the last one I read...just left a sour taste in my mouth on those occasions. </p>

 <p> 1. The author has interesting story to tell, but seems to not have a total understanding of English.2.This was not a complete book. It's a  &#34;To be continued&#34; offering, which really does an injustice to the story and to the reader.3. The Hunks on the Cover don't match the description of the Characters on their home planet.  They are guardians of the portals into our world and others, however the author does'nt give much detail on the whole mythos of the Garudians. </p>

 <p> I have read Trinity's work before so I know what her writing style is like and what to expect and I can honestly say I wasn't disappointed one bit. I do get abit worried about names or terms when I read books about character's being from different realms etc. etc. and there is a glossary that helps at the beginning of the book. But I can honestly say I wasn't lost with any of the story line I understood it all.I loved Maya's character she is a strong sassy woman who will help anyone she can. She will protect and fight for what she believes in so when she suddenly finds herself with 3 mates it's hard for her to give that control over to her mates.Even with all the women she finds and protects she still feels so alone and she finds it hard to believe that these males want her and that she will never be alone again.There are a few sex scenes which involve a little light BDSM which are Hot.The back story is great I love the plot Randolph killed all of Maya's Family and she is out to kill him and comes close so many times. As secrets are revealed and she finds out who betrayed her she finds herself with a new family and all she needs to go and get her revenge. Bring on book two and I hope Maya kicks some ass. </p>

 <p> 3.5 starsI really liked the story and characters. I've liked everything I've read from this author so far. It's a great start to a new series. It would benefit from editing. If it weren't for the lack of editing and poor spelling it would be a 5 star for me. </p>
