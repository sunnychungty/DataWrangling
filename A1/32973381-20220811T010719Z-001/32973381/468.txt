 <p> Scarface and Silk Smooth are two of my favorite authors. Scarface out done himself with this one. This story was breath taking. It keep you on rollercoaster ride from beginning to the end. Willow came out telling the truth from the beginning. I wondered why there were only two girls on the cover but you quickly find out why. Roxy was a backstabbing dirty cop who only used the girls for her on reasons. Things just aren't as they seem in this story but Scarface does not disappoint. The only I didn't like was the ending but I guess karma is a real b*tch!!! This story is a must read! It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I read it within a few hours! This story gets 5 stars and then some!!!!! </p>

 <p> This was a OK book with a unbelievable storyline.  For instance I got kind of confused when the girls kidnapped and hijacked the white lady at the mall. My confusion came in when they drove the truck though the electronics store and took the stuff. Then were able to get away and back to some cousins house and took the merchandise and put it in a truck and drove off after they let the women out of the trunk.  I was confused because I thought they burned the truck that belonged to the lady they kidnapped. I didn't quite understand who's truck they had and how they were able to drive the wrecked truck through the streets. Just my opinion.  Don't know why the previous reviews didn't mention all the grammatical errors this book had. I don't think I will read the next book coming out, unless there are more than 2 reviews. Good luck to the author with his/her next book! </p>

 <p> This was an ok read good enough that it kept me turning the pages to see what would happen next.  The ending left me wondering did Bam and Willow make it. I'm assuming there will be a part 2. </p>

 <p> This was a good book. Willow, Bam and Roxy are 3 tough young ladies. That seem to be down for each other. It was a shame how Roxy betrayed her friends for something that she had nothing to do with. Lorenzo really needed to have his head examined cause how could he hold his own daughter accountable for what her mother did to his brother and knowing what his brother did to his daughter when she was young. I love Grandma she is really what you call in OG and who will do anything to keep her family safe. Now Bam is one crazy girl who anybody would love to be around. Now her with her hair and food had me cracking up. She is the definition of a true friend. </p>
