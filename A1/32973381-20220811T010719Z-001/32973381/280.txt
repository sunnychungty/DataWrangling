 <p> I really enjoy the subdued nature of this series of made-for-TV movies. Selleck is terrific and the supporting cast excellent. Kathy Bates, Gloria Ruben, Wm. Devane (ex-cop, alcohol addiction counselor, and &#34;shrink&#34;), Kohl Sudduth, William Sadler--a great bad guy, and Saul Rubinek (&#34;I'm very fond of you, Jesse&#34;). You don't have to have the entire set to follow them but they do build on the previous ones. I own them all and sincerely hope the franchise is continued as long as there are Robert Parker novels to make them about.. </p>

 <p> I love this series and I am eagerly anticipating the next one. Sometimes I need to view the movie twice to pick up on all the details, giving each viewing a new spin on the story.  My only complaint is that I purchased the set for about ninety dollars only to have it drop to forty dollars the next week. </p>

 <p> The Jesse Stone collection is great. Not only is this a perfect role for Tom Selleck, but a great story line in each case as well. When I first heard Tom was to play this role I wasn't so sure. I liked Magnum PI, but this is a much different type of role. Once we started watching these shows, I was was positive this was made for him. Then I heard about the books it was more amazing how well Tom fits this role. I understand the author has recently passed. I hope there will be many more of these shows. After all look what they've done with Ian Fleming! My wife wasn't too crazy about Tom, but this role has turned her around, he is perfect in this role. The only problem with getting them on DVD is that it's over too soon! </p>

 <p> Tom Selleck is Jesse Stone!  I don't know who author Robert B. Parker might have envisioned inhabiting his iconic small town police chief, but Selleck has certainly owned and perfected the role over the course of these 6 made-for-TV movies.  Stone must surely be one of the most laid back heroes to ever grace the small screen and Selleck has perfected the minimalism necessary to make this character stand out.  In the film world of quick cut editing, these films defy expectation by unfolding at a very leisurely pace.  For the most part, the mysteries place a distant second in importance to the characterizations and the humor developed in the scripts (for which Parker does share a writer's credit).  For the Stone series to be successful, you've got to care about the principals.  So while Selleck is as comfortable as an old slipper in his role--it is also important to single out the recurring cast that helps to sell these tidy mysteries.  With stellar talents like Viola Davis, William Devane and Kathy Baker providing back-up (not to mention a quietly impressive Kohl Sudduth), it's easy to become invested in this small community of characters no matter what challenge they're faced to solved.Starting with 2005's "Stone Cold" through this year's (2010) "No Remorse," each of the six films obviously has its own central plot and mystery.  While the earlier films are probably regarded as stronger entries plot-wise (I found the convenience store diversion in the last film almost painful), I do think each chapter has enough to recommend it on its own merits.  You'll appreciate the films to varying degrees as with any serialization--some you may love, some just like.  However, to my way of thinking, what has made this series terrific is the continuing back story and its respect to the characters.  Jesse Stone and team have evolved through the years and their interactions, relationships and growth in the totality of these six films is what is so very special.In truth, there is nothing ground-breaking here.  Just old pros putting on some great entertainment.  Lacking hysterics and over-the-top action set pieces, the Jesse Stone series is a quietly compelling throw-back to when stories and people mattered more than special effects.  And, as always, the icing on the cake is the pitch perfect Tom Selleck who paints Jesse as both lovable and excruciatingly frustrating.  It may be his best role ever, so it's no surprise he's come back 6 times!  Enjoy. </p>

 <p> Having never read any of Parker's books, Stone Cold wasquite a pleasant surprise. Somehow I felt serene amongthe quiet hardships and overall morose atmosphere thatpervades each subsequent scene, something that directorRobert Harmon truly has a knack for capturing.I found that there was a mild relation to Stone's lonelinessand embittered past, and an unwavering solicitousnessfor his semi-controlled drunkenness, as glass by glassby glass by glass had gone by. An engrossing story andcharacter-driven series that left me anticipating thenext release.On my way home from the liquor store one dreary, rainynight, thirsting from my recently acquired taste for Scotch,I swerved into the video store to pick up the latest Stonedrama. And let me tell ya, a letdown it is not. It's chockfull of the quips, awkward interactions and quirkycharacters that we Stone fans have come to love.Though the books stopped with Parker's passing, Selleck andteam haven't. In the latter sequels the directors have alsochanged, but my trusty glass hasn't. And sure enough, Stonereluctantly seeks help from his witty psychiatrist time andagain. It really is comforting to see him putting forth theeffort.So, I recently checked myself into AA where I attempted toovercome my unquenchable thirst for Scotch; that, and mynewly-formed habit of speaking to people in a roundaboutcaustic manner, which I can tell you really vexes thoseamong the group, especially the chain smoking team leader.Oh, and I've been threatened several times with restrainingorders. I mean, jeez, just `cause a lonely guy hints at asex-filled 1st date w/o the strings, the dominantlyattractive women get all bent out of shape. Oh well, aCassanova I am not.Well, anyway, I've successfully transcended my problem,been ridin' the wagon awhile now down that bumpy road andI pray that Stone can one day do the same.And now, for some reason, I can't stop drinking coffee...cup after cup after cup after cup..... </p>

 <p> Saw most of these movies on TV but like them so much that when they became available in this set I had to get them.  Tom Selleck is great in these, the books are good and story line stays pretty much with the book.  Would recommend any Jessie Stone lover to buy these movies they make the books come to life. </p>

 <p> We enjoy character-driven shows, and that's exactly what this series is. No fluff, no fake computerized characters -- just good acting, great actors, and super plots. I have noticed a few discrepancies in the story-lines, but all in all I love the shows. </p>

 <p> This Jesse Stone Collection has the following six movies:- No Remorse- Thin Ice- Stone Cold- Sea Change- Night Passage- Death in ParadiseTom Selleck, as Jesse Stone, was a good selection as an actor, and I encourage the reader to read the reviews for the individual movies.  For this set, however, the price really isn't better than buying the movies individually.  I'm surprised at this.  I literally got a shrink-wrapped package of the six individual movies.Again, I enjoyed the movies.  I just expected there to be something special in a "collection," especially price-wise. </p>

 <p> Aren't sets supposed to be better deals than buying DVDs separately? </p>

 <p> We bought the entire selection of these really great murder mysteries. We actually watched them over just 2 days. It is nice to sit & watch one right after the other so you can see what started the episodes. We have been dealing with Amazon for years and never had any kind of a problem!!  Well done. </p>
