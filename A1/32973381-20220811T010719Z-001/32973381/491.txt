 <p> The story line was interesting. I liked the fact of the different shifters. There were some steamy scenes in here as well. But ... I don't feel lost at the end... like losing your BBF. When it ended that was it. Nothing I could sit back and say WoW!! </p>

 <p> I find that the greater variety of shifters that are introduced the more entranced I have become. I have thoroughly enjoyed meeting all these very interesting characters. </p>

 <p> Winning the Alpha was the first book in this series, this book, Bearing Up in Wolf Rock is the second.  While I enjoyed the humor and quirky characters of the first book, this one doesn't pass muster.Kyla Greene is a curvy wolf, one of the few females in her pack.  She seems to be a sentry for the pack, trusted by the alpha, and out patrolling.  Other than that there isn't much about her.  She meets up with Maddox in a bar and they're both strongly attracted to each other.  While they do act on that attraction, it's this back and forth. . . Will he stay, will the alpha accept him, all this back and forth stuff which dragged out the plot.Like most shifter books, hunters are involved.  In this one they are more detailed and solutions are given, so at least those ends are tied up.  But there wasn't any edge of my seat type of anticipation.  The whole thing was boring.  Of course shifters heal and survive but the way it was written -- Kyla didn't go into any deep emotion, it was more about the facts and a quick recovery.I thought it odd Maddox talked about his parents but never called them.  Kyla was phoning everyone yet Maddox was not.  Not even when things were settled.Personally I wouldn't recommend this for those that loved the first story, as I did.  This one had no humor, the angst was a bit over the top because the situation was just odd, and the hunters were pansies.  The whole wrap up was a bit too pat.  - Dan's Wife </p>

 <p> 2 out of 5 stars. This is the first novel of this series that I've read, and while I could follow the plot fine it was just to damn slow to be enjoyable. I mean I made an effort to finish this novel in hopes that I'd like the characters and the plot better. Yet even though I tried, I found it really hard to appreciate Maddox as the hero, he was to softhearted and doesn't act like the type of strong/possessive alpha male that I'm used reading/enjoying.Overall, I believe this series has potential which is why I rated it as I did even though I am not a fan of it.I only recommend it to those who are fans of Ms. Wilder and/or like this series.Review By: From Me to You ...

 <p> I enjoyed this book very much. The pace is not fast, more of a medium paced book. Although it is still a very good read. The characters are human in their personalities, with all of the difficulties in life that everyone real has. That they manage these, and still go forward is a blessing more wish they had. That the stories stand alone, but are part of a series, is wonderful, for me, because I started with book 2. I am going to get book 1, and wait impatiently for all that follow, or are not in print now. This new 'breed' of shifters, is interesting, and I look forward to finding out about all of the different types, and their abilities. Read it and judge for yourself. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> I gave this book a try in the hopes that it would be a better read than the first book in this series.  It wasn't.  I didn't finish -- the pace was too slow and the characters too shallow.  The author kept having the heroine refer to herself as &#34;one of the only female members&#34; of the wolf pack.  This is not a correct statement -- the character is either &#34;the only&#34; or &#34;one of the few&#34; -- I don't care which.  But the repetition of this phrase became like a pebble in my shoe; it annoyed me way out of proportion to the blunder.  Obviously, this is not a book I can recommend.  There are far better books out there to spend money on. </p>

 <p> The second book wasn't any better than the first book </p>

 <p> This is the second in the series.  The first is &#34;Winning The Alpha&#34;.  I read this one first; it stands alone just fine.  This book is one of the best BBW shifter romances out there.  The female lead is strong and the relationship with her male counterpart is complex, sweet and thoughtful.  It's not poisoned by an overdose of hyperbole.  Some BBW shifter books are just way too &#34;damsel in distress&#34;.  This is nothing like that.  In this book the female lead is real, solid, competent and truly a hero.  This is done really well.  She is treated as a whole person.  In fact, she is not a &#34;strong female&#34; at all; she is a strong person.  It's great!  Wilder manages to get her lead well and truly romanced by a man without making any insinuation that her gender implies ownership by the man.  There is no &#34;claiming&#34;.  They fall in love.  It's really freaking nice.  And the sex is great! </p>
