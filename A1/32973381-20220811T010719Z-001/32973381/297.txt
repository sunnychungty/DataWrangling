 <p> "Dark Feed"(Lions Gate, 2013)3.5 StarsA low-budget slasher film is being filmed in an old mental hospital -- a facility shuttered years earlier due to the suicide of its lead doctor. A cranky, overtired movie crew wanders around the grimy, darkened ruins, bickering with each other, seeing and hearing weird stuff, and occasionally murdering one another. This is basically midnight-movie horror flick comfort food - nothing terribly original, yet suspenseful and creepy enough that fans of the genre may be entertained. Strong points include the ambiguity over whether the horror is caused by hallucinations or hauntings -- the old hospital was apparently a test site for the infamous MKUltra mind control program, but is it ghosts of old victims or leftover chemicals that are driving the new folks nuts? Amid the echoes of "Crazies," "The Shining" and a bazillion other old movies there are some fine, campy performances as well as a few clever touches (is the sound man really hearing spirit voices in his headphones, or is he just... hearing things?) as well as several genuinely gross, creepy scenes. Worth a whirl, just don't drink the water. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews) </p>

 <p> DARK FEED Produces Little Bang For Your Horror Buck </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Here's the thing: horror without any investment in character is simply just an idea plus gore.  It equals nothing more than an exercise in gratuitous violence, society's biggest complaint against cookie-cutter horror films.  And that's a legitimate complaint: after all, why should anyone invest ninety or more minutes of their life in something that, in the end, is nothing more than one more chance for special effects people to show you how they can destroy a human body?  Maybe there's some benign fascination in that - like those who do slow down to ogle the car crash for its inevitable victims - but aren't you still left with just a car crash?(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers solely necessary for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Seriously, people, can I ask you: did anything good ever come from filming a movie inside an abandoned psychiatric hospital?  Hasn't this been done before enough?  Well, to its credit, DARK FEED does try to throw one interesting twist into the mix - the haunted hospital has the ability to infect those who enter it with a psychosis that forces one to do harm unto himself as well as others - and, like any good twist, I welcomed it only until I realized that the script - conceived and directed by Michael and Shawn Rasmussen (this is their first production, as best as I could research) - really did nothing with that conceit.  Instead, we're treated to a plethora of one-name characters spending the night shooting their film inside these dark corridors slowly going crazy and resorting to bloodshed as a cure.Disappointingly, there's no substance to any of these characters.  They're all one-dimensional - a bad narrative choice - because, as a result, you don't care about any of them.  If you don't care about any of them, then there's little to no interest in seeing what essentially happens to them.  So much effort went into fleshing out the hospital that no one even gives these players a second look.  They behave as do the worst creations populating yet the next predictable horror thriller - too self-absorbed to see what they've unleashed upon themselves and too ignorant to do anything to stop it.At best, DARK FEED might be an easy, breezy Friday night scare, though I found myself reaching for the Fast Forward button on more than one instance.  At worst, you'll demand your money back from the video rental store.DARK FEED is produced by Rasmussen Brothers Productions.  DVD distribution is being handled through Lionsgate.  As for the technical aspects ... well, the picture looks and sound decidedly murky, as is the nature of the story being told here ... but I can't help think it may've been served to throw a little more light on a few of these sets.  It wasn't all that hard to see at times, but some definition is rarely a bad thing.  The disk has an assortment of special features - deleted scenes, gag reels, auditions, rehearsals, and the theatrical trailer - but I honestly wasn't interested enough in any of it to check them out.(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED.  It isn't that DARK FEED doesn't have a clever idea.  It does.  It's just that it does little to nothing with it except to build upon the traditional ghost story by making it contagious.  While that idea may not be all that new, it's still an interesting conceit.  I'd be interested in seeing what more money and more talent and a stronger script could bring to the table, but, as this picture is, it's entirely forgettable.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Lionsgate provided me with an advance DVD screener of DARK FEED for the expressed purposes of completing this review. </p>

 <p> I strongly believe that there is a place in the market for low budget, independent films - if only because they afford the opportunity to discover some talents who are unknown to the general public but certainly deserving of roles in The Big Time.In this particular film, it's an actor named Jonathan Thomson, who has a presence that made me wonder why someone in the industry hasn't noticed his potential appeal and grabbed him for some major productions.Wake up, out there!  Here's some untapped talent - not to mention unique appeal not in the current "cookie cutter" mold that makes so many current "movie stars" pretty much interchangeable in many respects.  He definitely made this movie far more watchable than it would have been without him, despite his far too limited screen time. </p>

 <p> Dull horror film about a film crew using a closed down asylum as a movie set.  Eventually the members of the crew start killing each other or themselves.  Is it the mold in the air?  Old experimental drugs in the water pipes?  Ghosts?  You really won't care.  The asylum setting is actually pretty creepy.  Too bad the filmmakers couldn't figure out anything interesting to do with it. </p>

 <p> Starts off with some young woman (Evalena Marie &#34;Remains&#34;) in a basement either cleaning or fixing it, well that leads us to some people coming to film a cheap horror movie in this abandoned building with it's own dark past. Of course initially things are fine, but then strange things start to happen, people die off and well not much is really explained (stuff just sort of happens). Even the closing sequences don't offer much if any explanation, then again the film is beyond help way before this.Believe me I've seen worse, but this wasn't very good, for a cheap price it's something to watch though. *1/2 out of 4 stars </p>

 <p> This movie had all the parts needed- what a concept!  This movie was completed by college students three years ago on their budget.  Keeps you in suspense and if you're sheepish this is not for you!  The whole premise of a "B" rated film crew doing a low cut budget with low paid actors, so if the movie seems like it has bad acting or is a B movie, that is the intent!  Loved it to the end and never figured out how it would end! </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Whenever I read something like &#34;from the writers of...&#34; I begin to worry. If you have to attach your name to a previous semi-successful project to get people to watch it almost always turns out bad. That doesn't quite happen with DARK FEED.Scripted by the writers of John Carpenter's THE WARD, this film tells the story of a group of film makers making a low budget horror film. To save money on sets, they choose to shoot on location inside an abandoned mental hospital that's been left behind and in the worst condition imaginable.As the film opens the writer of the movie being shot arrives and gets a walk through of the location as well as introductions to the crew. He immediately develops a crush on the assistant producer which comes in handy in a film like this. Those usually end up being the only people left alive by the end of the film. Yes, this film falls into formula territory early on.As the shooting continues the crew becomes tired but forced to carry on since the producer wants to save money and shooting at night to get what they need is necessary. But as they continue shooting an evil presence takes over and the sets become darker just as their moods do. Things that go bump in the night turn up as do bodies of the cast and crew. It seems that the history of the hospital is something the producer should have looked into before they started shooting.As the deaths pile up and the ghosts begin making themselves more apparent our couple does their best to simply survive and find a way out. You're never quite sure if they're going to make it until the end of the film and the scares that fill up screen time are done well enough to make those who don't frequently watch this kind of film jump but perhaps not the hard core horror fans.While this isn't the best horror film ever made or perhaps not even included in the mid-range, it does offer a few nice items. Die hard horror fans will be disappointed though having sat through so many movies just like this. It doesn't offer anything new but does give you the same old same old in bearable enough fashion. </p>

 <p> Okay, here we go  again...an abandoned psychiatric hospital is the site for the filming of a low-budget filom.  The film's writer shows up to see how things are going and is greeted by the predictable stereotypes---and a brackish black goo oozing through the walls.  Seems like some secret experiment is the basis for the icky mess.DARK FEED is tedious, boring and shoddily done, with no real scares or suspense.  Films like this give horror a bad name. </p>

 <p> Dark Feed (Michael and Shawn Rasmussen, 2013)I'm not entirely sure what possessed me to give Dark Feed a go. I mean, it was kind of doomed from the start. But still, I figured there might still be a touch of meat left on those old bones. And I still believe that, somewhere, there might be. It is not to be found here, however.Premise: a film crew rents an abandoned, and supposedly haunted, asylum for a bit. They move in, set up shop, and start filming a low-budget horror movie. But soon enough they discover that either they've got a psycho in their midst or the place really is haunted.Sound familiar? It should if you've watched a few horror movies. This is a run-of-the-mill haunted house flick with the requisite bevy of attractive women and brainless men. There's one character who points to the Rasmussen brothers intending this as a satire of the movie industry (or perhaps just the big studio system), but if so, that message kind of got lost in the mix; it's certainly not done here as well as it is in, say, Golia's Killer Shrimps. I ended up feeling like if they'd puched the envelope anywhere at all in this movie, done one thing different than everyone else making low-budget DTV horror, I might have found something more to enjoy in it. Sadly, that was not the case. *  </p>

 <p> I had bought this before I saw reviews, and sort of put off watching it for a few days because I was prepared to be disappointed/disgusted that I wasted my money on it.  Instead, I found this to be a fairly low-budget horror flick that actually teeters between three and four stars on a scale of 1-5.  It's suspenseful, it's creepy, it's nasty, and while overall, some parts of it don't make a lot of sense, and it's not really revealed what's going on at the end, it still packed enough of a punch to be fairly interesting and entertaining.  For some reason a film crew is filming a movie at an old asylum, the site of many dark deeds in the past, including the death of the head honcho and his family by his hands.  Now, many strange things are happening, some of which appear to be because of either the air or the water in the facility.  This is rather nasty in some parts, especially when the lead actor of the film that's being made decides he wants to take on the role of the female character too.  A lot of what goes on in some parts is dark & murky so you aren't sure what exactly happened, but that's a relatively minor complaint.  Not bad, I thought it was worth seeing & I didn't put it in the "trade in" pile. </p>

<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> THIS IS A CLOSED SET </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This is a low budget film about filming a low budget film in an asylum, something that has been done before and more importantly...better. This is not a found footage film, which was what I expected and that is a plus. The asylum has been shut down for only six years, after the director killed himself. It looks old because of pipes breaking causing water damage.This asylum used experimental water on the patients as part of the government's MKULTRA project. The film takes a long time to build all the characters on the set. It does so in different fashions from dinner conversation to the blond actress (Rebecca Whitehurst) being told, "They're stage directions. You don't read them."There are little tidbits in the dialouge to indicate some level of clever writing. The action builds slow, in fact a little too slow as the first snuffing doesn't happen until 36 minutes into the film. No opening hook with a "6 hours earlier" following the credits.The film seems to center on Chris the writer (Andy Rudick) and Beth the grip (Victoria Nugent) who in a geeky way like each other but both being too shy to make a move. There is some minor internal conflict, conflict which escalates as the players get exposed to the water. It is just a question as to who becomes the killers and who becomes the "kill-ees."I thought the scenes were done well. The acting was fairly decent. The film just couldn't put it together and hold your interest. The characters and plot didn't have any hook. Might work as a rental. Not a keeper.Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex. No nudity, just Rebecca Whitehurst "side breast" </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Bad acting, overused plot, no budget. If you are a hardcore horror fan you may like this, others should avoid. I say D+ </p>

 <p> "Did you see that!?" A film crew shooting a low budget horror movie moves into a abandoned psychiatric hospital. The hospital seems to take on a life of it's own the longer the crew stays. Little be little the cast and crew begin to notice strange things happening. I will admit that I had pretty low expectations for this even though I did like The Ward. I also realize the movie is about a low budget film crew but just because that's the plot doesn't mean they only have to hire bad actors. Not only is the fake movie low budget and bad acting, the actual movie is low budget and bad acting. It's hard to knock the movie based on budget but there comes a point where you have to realize that acting does matter, even in really low budget throw away movies like this. The rest of the movie was pretty much cookie cutter and not that scary to me. If you are a hardcore horror fan you may like this, I did not. Overall, the bad acting was too distracting for me to fully get into the movie. I say D+. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Horrendous characters ruin an otherwise decent low-budget flick </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Classic case of a film that should have focused more on the story instead of 20 characters who the audience doesn't care about or contribute anything of consequence to the film.  Seriously, I know there's an entire film crew present making a horror film at this asylum, but that doesn't mean we have to know every single person working on the thing.  Especially when 50% of the male cast is interchangeably the 'douchebag stoner' type.  Worse, the main character is a schmuck--and a horrible actor to boot.  The characters are insufferable and infuriating, to say the least.Which is unfortunate because the movie looks good, has eerie music, and has a potentially terrifying story if only they bothered to tell it.  I would have liked to know more about the history of the asylum and things that happened there in the past. That really could have fleshed the film out and made it super creepy.  Instead, couple the crappy characters with the crappy ending (that renders the whole movie pointless) and you get a film that could have been a low budget classic reduced to low budget crap. </p>
