<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Loved the illustrations, but ... </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> It was, well, boring. I really wanted to like it. There is a positive message and the author's heart is in the right place. But, a good story can teach without preaching. The Sneetches by Dr. Seuss is a great example of the kind of message this author was trying to get across, but well-written in a highly entertaining and engaging way. This story fell short. I did like the illustrations and the book could help you start a conversation with a child having self esteem issues or struggling to "fit in" at school. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> A Song of Praise </p>

 <p> This book is a good choice to instill confidence and self-esteem in children. The illustrations are simple but adequate to tell the story. Camilla the Clarinet is told by Tim the Trombone that she should not play in the school concert because she sounds too squeaky. Together with her friend, Fred the Flute, they visit other musical instruments like Danny the Drums and Vanessa Violin. They reassure Camilla that she plays nicely, but now Camilla seems to find fault with the way they play. Fred the Flute continues to maintain his confidence in Camilla's talent. Camilla is beginning to believe in herself. Will she ever be good enough to play in the school orchestra? Will the rest of the instruments accept her and what does Camilla learn about herself and others? </p>
