 <p> This was a very  interesting tale of the life of Alexander Graham Bell and more so because of the fine acting of Loretta Young </p>

 <p> This is a very well done film starring Don Ameche as Alexander Graham Bell and Loretta Young as his encouraging wife.  Don Ameche's portrayal of Alexander Graham Bell is very nice and sympathetic and one feels his glee when he is happy.  One also sympathizes with him when he gives his heroic speech for the lone inventor in court.  Loretta's portrayal of his wife is very nice as well, a little on the melodramatic side which is typical for the time period.  But still very admirable and enjoyable.  One of the cute vignettes throughout the movie are the comments of Henry Fonda as Bell's assistant Watson.  I laughed at nearly everything he said.  Everybody in my family enjoyed watching this movie and I believe yours will too! </p>

 <p> Don Ameche Is fabulous as Alexander Graham Bell.  Long a favorite of mine in musical entertainers, Don Ameche proves his mettle in a serious bio of one of America's premiere inventors.  The supporting cast includes Henry Fonda in a secondary role as Bell's assistant, Mr. Watson, and he does a fine job of it. Of course, there is always the reliable and inimitable talents of Charles Coburn to add just enough character to the story and his is a plum role as well.  All in all a very well acted and well directed film. </p>

 <p> The first intelligible words ever heard were..."Come Here Mr. Watson...I Need YOU!"  And the rest is history! </p>

 <p> When older people will talk about the Ameche, they are talking about the telephone, as this film was popular in its day.Don Ameche plays Bell during the period in his life just before inventing the telephone -- where he just about starved, got kicked out of boarding houses, begged for funds so he could buy supplies for his inventions.The always beautiful Loretta Young plays Bell's future wife -- she is deaf and lip reads.  Her father, played by Charles Coburn -- a fabulous character actor and great comic actor -- funds Bell's research.He gets the telephone to work, founds the Bell Company and installs his device all over the Northeast -- until a competing company steals his technology and almost wipes him out.  He could have quit, but Young's character sticks by him through the legal wranglings.  &#34;Ma Bell&#34; survives, of course.  The rest, as they say, is history.If you didn't know the details of how the Ameche -- er -- telephone -- was invented, read a book or watch this movie. </p>

 <p> Every now and then I discover a real gem as I watch some of the older movies (pre-1950's). This has a nice biographical story of Alexander Graham Bell, well-acted, fine sets and scenery, and with some tension. Films like this don't need violence or weird humour or twisty plots or overacting! This is simply a good movie! </p>

 <p> Fox made a bunch of these Bio classics and they are all superb.  This one ranks right up there with the rest and is fairly accurate.  Henry Fonda steels this picture though.  He is very funny in the few scenes he is in.  A very moving story that is factual as well as entertaining.  Another homeschool friendly flick...with a tad bit more romance than Tom Edison, but nothing like movies of today.  An ejoyable movie for the whole family that could breed some good discussion afterwards! </p>

 <p> Another Hollywood epic on the life of a great inventor. Again dramatized for public consumption but in general terms a good representation of A.G.Bell's discovery of the telephone. </p>

 <p> Great clean family movie. Though this is based on the inventor it gives a look into the struggles and romantic involvement of Alexander Bell. Others make claim Alexander Bell stole their idea and invention trying out do him because financial success the telephone will bring.  Great actors included Henry Fonda was very funny, Charles Coburn, Spring Byington. If you are a fan of classic movies its a must have for your collection. </p>

 <p> Greedy Over Invention </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> Those were the very first words spoken (and successfully received by another party) via telephone by Alexander Graham Bell, the Scotsman who invented the telephone.  The tale begins in 1875.  Young Alex Bell is shown eating cheese and apples while trying to send speech over copper wires.  No one thinks much of this idea except the deaf daughter of one of his grudging sponsors (the deaf girl is Loretta Young). Folks were inclined to call it a toy and they kept away from it; Bell himself tended to distust it.  When Bell wants an ambulance, he sends a friend out to call one.  &quot;This thing will never work&quot; he lamented.  But it did of course, and soon the Western Union was trying to claim the patent...Don Ameche does rather well here, playing Bell with surprising conviction.  Henry Fonda is fine as the sensible Mr. Watson as is Charles Coburn as the methodical Mr. Hubbard. The most moving scene in the entire film is when a mute boy, who had never spoken before, enunciates the word &quot;father&quot; (sob!).  The direction by Irving Cummings is piously sincere. </p>

 <p> I bought this video new.  The story line is excellent.  The acting is excellent.  The scene in the courtroom is clever and excellent.  The depiction of American history is excellent.  The costumes are stylized and overwrought, as was typical during the earlier days of Hollywood.  The film is an excellent teaching device for kids.  This film was one of the eternal favorites of our parents' generation and our grandparents' generation.  But there is a slight problem.  There are irritating crackling noises throughout.  Why is this?  The crackling noises make the movie almost unbearable.  I was only able to watch this otherwise excellent movie only once.  I own about 50 videotapes, many of them bought second hand.  Crackling noises of the same type occur on only one of these, namely, Three Stooges in Orbit, which I bought new.  Can any of the reviewers of this product provide insight as to the source of the noises?  Can somebody please tell the manufacturer that they need to do something about the noises. </p>
