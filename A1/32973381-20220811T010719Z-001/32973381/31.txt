<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> The cables seem to work without any issues, however the cabled as become separated from the end leaving the bare wires exposed. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> It is a wonderful product that came fast and was easy to set up. I dragged it from the router across the house to my computer, it fit with length to spare and didn't loose power or weaken signal on the way! I have gone through many bad or damaged cables but this durable and strong cable is going to last me a long time.  Would recommend! </p>

 <p> This wire appears to have no flaws - using it in a 100Mhz Home Network. CAT 5 would have worked fine, but bought the CAT 6 for future system. </p>

 <p> Works great, no problems, could have used a 50 ft, but 75 was cheeper dont know why.  I do not know why anyone would pay more in a store for the same thing. </p>

 <p> As others have posted this cable is of poor construction and quality. I am unable to get gigabit connections. The shielding has split at one end and I haven't even touched it after install.Very disappointing. </p>

 <p> It is a good cable and at a good price. I've been using it for a long while now and it's working great. I do notice that it is a little faster than the cat5 cable I used to use. </p>

 <p> This product works exactly as advertised. It is sold for a fraction of the price of cables you see in your local electronics or office supply stores. I am using this to connect the router in my office to an 8 port switch in the living room. Connected to that 8 port switch is my TV, DirecTV DVR, and Blu-ray player. The two most intensive application I use are when streaming movies from DirecTV or Netflix (via the Blu-ray player) and both work great. I have not had any problems. </p>

 <p> A good cable and the quality seems like it will hold up over time.The price was right, fast shipping.I used it for my home theater setup and the TV, Bluray and HTPC stream everything good.The connectors have a protective cover over the release tab rather than a full boot.I personally like it since most of the time I leave the boot pulled back for easy removal.Only con is they didn't pull it through my drop ceiling for me. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Bad connection </p>

 <p> This cable is useless bacause the connectors on the both ends of this cable do not stay connected to my router, while all other cables I have work perfectly. </p>

 <p> Works great. Only problem I had was the cable kept twisting up and getting tangled. Had to keep unwinding it when running it through the ceiling. But as long as it works, that's all I care about. </p>

 <p> This came to me exactly as pictured. Seems to be good quality at a good price. The cable comes slightly stiff but they all do. It has worked great since I got it. No packet loss, no connection issues. Good buy! </p>

 <p> Nothing complicated with this product.  It's not the prettiest (clutter of blue cable), but it gets the job done.  If you want to reduce clutter, go with a router; however, this cable is simple to use. </p>

 <p> Unfortunately, my purchase is outside the return window. I bought two of these cables to wire my house. Having tested them using a gigabit router and my laptop's gigabit ethernet port, I am getting 100mbps, not 1000bps (1.0gbps). I'm very disappointed. I tried a different brand Cat6 cable, and got 1000mbps. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Not cat 6 speeds </p>

 <p> I purchased a Synology DS411+ and was using this "cat6" cable to connect to a DLink gigabit router.  I was getting terrible transfer speeds of 11mb/sec until I replaced it.  I made my own cat 5e cable, disconnected the purchased cable (real pain to disconnect from imac i7) and replace with my homemade version.  Immediately I got 75mb/sec transfer speeds.I couldn't believe it so I disconnected and tried this cable a second time and again transfer speeds  10mb/sec +/-.  I reconnected the hacked together cable and geot 75-85 mb/sec transfer speeds.  I'm going to try a different brand cat 6 cable and wasted my money on this...  Buyer beware </p>

 <p> We bought this cable to connect our DSL router to a secondary wireless router so that we could solve the problem of dead zones in our house.  The wire works like a charm and we were able to connect the original DSL wireless router from Verizon to an additional router and now have internet everywhere in our house.  Mission accomplished! </p>

 <p> Purchased this to run from my router to my Playstation 3, which is a different room. I subscribe to GVTC's 40 mb fiber to the home and consistently get 38+ mb download speeds when I run the internet connection test on the PS3. So it appears to be working as advertised! </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Yes.. all Cat6 cables are "the same". The quality of materials on this cable are "good enough" to meet cat6 standards. However the outer covering of the cable is kinda of mushy, gets discolored easily, not super durable. This is unlike cables from M0N0PR1C3 which a affordable and high quality. This cable gets two stars in quality of materials for a nice connector.It works... if you need a cheap cable fast and you have Prime. Get it, but it's not terribly nice to work with. </p>

 <p> Very fast cable </p>

 <p> This cable came in a great shape, same price as cat5This cable was the main connection between Samsung blu-ray player and my ATT router. I never had any issues with it. the cable had no twist or scratches.I did not notice a big different in performance, may be if my Vonage router was between them then performance will matter. but this cable did just fine.to notice the performance difference, you need to have all your devices wired with Cat6ExampleIF you, Vonage router, Desktop, XBOX360, Blu-ray player or wired TV, and the main internet provider.each one of these devices will take Cat6 cable connect them straight to the router. My att router has several ports that holds all of them, all of these devices are able to communicate with each other and share files/videos/photos. then that where you will notice a difference. </p>

 <p> This cable has the cheapest insulation wrap I have ever come across. Just the slightest bend and it will discolor and split. There is also very little flex or give without distorting the insulation which is important with a 75 foot cable. Very poorly made. </p>
