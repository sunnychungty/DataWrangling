 <p> I like offbeat as long as it's understandable...I did not find these episodes to be so. Not up to usual HBO standards. </p>

 <p> I believe this show debuted in 1983 on HBO and started out very strong.  As the 1980's dragged to a close, the shows got weaker and weaker with every season.  Most of the shows in this collection are from the mid to late 1980's so you won't actually see the best shows the series produced.  I really hoped the shows from the first couple of seasons would have been included because they were much better.  Needless to say, these are pretty standard horror stories that seasoned genre fans will not find too interesting.  The show featured many up-and-coming stars who were building their careers during the 1980's and many of them went on to much bigger and better things.  Some of them are Helen Hunt, Kirstie Alley, Willem Defoe, and Peter Coyote.  I liked the show much better back then than I do now but then I was only a teenager and did not know the horror plot conventions like I know now.  I mainly bought this for nostalgic reasons. </p>

 <p> I remember watching this back when it was on HBO.  This set is a mixed bag.  Some episodes are terrific and others not so great.  But, for the price $4.99 you could do worse. </p>

 <p> What a great volume and for the price it's available it's a steal!!!!Well of course had to wait a year or two for it but I am a very patient person.I remember this show briefly way before HBO was known as it today for their cable programs. This DVD set looks great the episode looks crisp and clear. The special features could have been better but we do get director's commentary on several episodes.All the episodes were memorable. I liked the  Paul Verhoeven episode, the Kirstie Alley episode "Legend of Billy B" I think it was called was a laugh a minute. I also loved the episode with Helen Hunt a pretty clever use of moving the camera on and off. What else the episodes with James Remar "Home Bodies" was also memorable. The episode with Joe Pantoliano "Miracle of Alice Ames" about the phony preacher was great. Margot Kidder as the diabolic nurse in "Nightshift" was also funny, realistic and entertaining. All the episode feature first rate actors who went on to do bigger things. I really do hope they continue to release more volumes. </p>

 <p> It goes back to the 1980's when just a simple half hour program w/different plots every week.Reminds me a little of the classic TWILIGHT ZONE. </p>

 <p> Alfred Hitchcock Presents meets The Twilight Zone! I got into this show in college and loved it. It is basically an anthology series with moral lessons at the end. I loved Page Fletcher as the hitchhiker/narrator. All the episodes were great. They were suspenseful, spooky, and sometimes supernatural. Check it out if you get the chance-you won't regret it! </p>

Like Route 66, The Fugitive, or The Incredible Hulk, to name a few, each story  is unrelated to any other except by the conceptual vehicle of the perpetual wanderer.  Like One Step Beyond or The Twilight Zone, The Hitchhiker himself is not a player in the tales.  Occasionally stories involved supernatural forces, but most plot twists stemmed from the dark side of the human spirit.In 1996, The Hitchhiker entered into syndication on the USA Channel and so was re-edited to remove the violence and/or nudity and sexuality that were featured on the HBO runs (and to make room for commercials).  Originally the Hitchhiker was cast with Nicholas Campbell as the host, but Campbell was quickly replaced with Page Fletcher.  In order to preserve continuity during the syndication runs, Campbell's scenes in the first three episodes were later re-shot with Fletcher.  But because the character of the Hitchhiker initially had more interaction with the people in the stories, this caused certain scenes to appear very choppy.There is a little confusion as to how many seasons the show actually ran since season one ran for two and a half years!  The Hitchhiker ran for a total of  seven and a half years with a ten month break between season one and two, and a two year break between two and three.  There were a total of 85 episodes over four seasons on HBO (six seasons on USA Channel).  The series is available on DVD in two different versions. The HBO two-disc sets for sale in the US contain episodes that are out of sequence to their original US broadcast order.  The Canadian DVD box sets by Alliance Atlantis  have the episodes arranged by season in the same order in which they were broadcast in Canada. </p>

 <p> It was a good value. I saw one in the 80s.  It was much better than I recall. I will definately buy the next one. It makes a great addition to any collection. The value was good. I highly reccomend it.  The acting and stories were quite good and passed the test of time with flying colors. </p>

 <p> I remember seeing this late at night on HBO, and not really liking or understanding any of the stories.  I just tuned in to see some naked women.  The stories?  It was stuff that was over my head.  I just didn't get how anybody could shoot this stuff, and why on earth anyone would make up these awful stories.In retrospect it's a kind of criminal-drama meets the Twilight Zone.  It shows people acting just plain wacky and insane.  Driven way beyond sanity by something I don't think the lay audience member, me included, understand.At least with Rod Serling you understood that normal people were in over their heads in extraordinary circumstances.  In The Hitchhiker, it's like these people make these really psychotic circumstances for the sake of it.Fond memories of naked women from my youth, but beyond that I think the drama is just out there.  I bought the DVD set some years back thinking to relive some memories, and watching it with a more intelligent and critical eye I'm a little baffled as to who the target audience is.  But, whatever.  I tuned in for the naked babes, not the wackos which creep me out even more now than then.In retrospect some of it is kind of hammy as well.  An erotic thriller series, to me, wouldn't involve nut-cases and psychos.  But I guess someone had to do it. </p>

 <p> Below is a review of this product:The Hitchhiker, Vol. 1 DVD.  Amazon may display this review on the page of another version of this product, for which this review may not apply.  After reading this review, please click on the link so that you can be assured that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for.--------------------------------------------------Ok, let me start right off and tell you that I do not own, nor have I even seen this DVD. However, I own the 3-disc 26 episode "Season 1" set released in Canada (feel free to read my reviewhere on Amazon's U.S. site) and I feel that I should do a quick comparison of both.This set gives you less episodes for more money than the Canada set. This set costs $31.48 US Dollars plus shipping for 10 episodes. The Canada set cost me $34.57 US Dollars *WITH* "Expedited International Shipping" for 26 episodes!The Canada set contains the first 26 episodes of the series (seasons 1 - 3 here, season 1 in Canada), but in a different order from how it was shown in the United States. This set contains 10 episodes from Season 3 (Nightshift, W.G.O.D., Man's Best Friend, Ghostwriter, Last Scene), Season 4 (Why Are You Here?, Homebodies, The Legendary Billy B., In the Name of Love), and Season 5 (The Miracle of Alice Ames). The season 3 episodes are also in the Canada set.The Canada set does have a lot of cheapness to it. For starters, there is an ungodly amount of compression artifacts found in the set. Practically EVERY episode has at least one noticeable artifact (though admittedly a few of these you'd have to have an "eye" for in order to see them). Also, it comes in a cheap top/bottom load slipsleeve (the cases easily fall out when you take it off the shelf). I wish it was a side loader like most DVD-set sleeves. Plus there are numerous errors in the text on the packaging (lots of cast members who aren't in the episodes on the discs, one director not involved in the episodes on the discs, and a few spelling and character name errors), which makes it seems quite unprofessional.There are two episodes in the Canada set, which are also in this set, that have video/audio errors. In "Last Scene" there's an original tape defect at 28:35. In "Man's Best Friend" there is no audio from 12:42-12:46. The original Lorimar video I have has the audio. The DVD cuts out music and the dog panting and the first part of Michael O'Keefe's dialogue ("I mean..."). I wonder if these two errors are in this set as well.Each episode in the Canada set has a 2.0 (stereo) and 5.1 audio track. I really see no need for the 5.1 track and would have preferred that they left it off (maybe there wouldn't be so many damn compression artifacts if they had that extra space on the discs to work with). From what I've read, this set has the original mono track as well as a stereo track. I would have preferred that the Canada set had this, especially since the stereo track is probably just a downsample of the 5.1 track (on rare occasion the stereo track has a stereo effect at the oddest spots - like in dialogue - which wouldn't be there if that were the original audio track of the series).The U.S. set contains bonus features, namely audio commentaries on selected episodes, plus closed captions, and multi-language subtitles. The Canada set contains NO bonus features, other than the unnecessary 5.1 audio track.I gave this set 3 stars only because I presume it doesn't have any compression artifacts like the Canada set does. I didn't include the audio commentaries in the rating because I never heard them and I'm trying to fairly compare both sets based on the episodes themselves.If you want a more detailed review from someone who actually owns this set, read [...] </p>
