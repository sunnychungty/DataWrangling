 <p> If you are going to buy the Kindle edition please be ready to also read the paperback. I listened to it first on text to speech off of my Kindle. The plot is woven much too tightly to try to hear it. If your mind wanders, you can't go back like you would if you were reading it.That said, this is another well-crafted story with a more serious tone than Pat Bertram's other thriller, "A Spark of Heavenly Fire."This story also takes place in Colorado and the reader is drawn into the story to try to predict the outcome, but that's not possible here. The probabilities are many but there is only one truth that leads to the solution of why Bob has memories of burying his mother...twice. Why are there two of him? Why would someone try to impersonate him?At first, I was sure there was some neural interface misleading Bob but that was wrong too. The answer to this mystery is very clever and I can't spoil it for the rest of the readers.Pat Bertram uses every day people of low profile as victims of a crime that is made by high profile people. The drama plays out in the style of Alfred Hitchcock.All I can say is...you might have a clue but you would still not figure out the why of it. I bought two extra books for friends. This is a great riddle and a thriller that will make you want to read another one. </p>

 <p> I laughed with Pat while reading Daughter Am I, was scared by what happened in A Spark of Heavenly Fire, sighed with Pat's Light Bringer Check out my reviews on author's other books!But, Wow! I sat in amazed suspense as I read More Deaths Than One...The first reason I was amazed was that each of Pat's books are so uniquely different,  The second was that, for me, this, last book was a mystery/suspense--my preferred reading--and therefore the most enjoyable...so far! I do hope she continues writing! Her imagination and creativity is exciting and diverse--readers may not be able to rely on what each book will cover, but we can be sure that it will be top rate!Meet Robert Stark... He is a character like no other you will ever meet, but you will remember him even if you've just met him through this book. He's shy, average in all ways and lives in a boarding house with few, if any, friends. Sometimes. Sometimes he's completely different. We soon find out that he's just returned to Denver, Colorado, after having lived in Thailand since he was serving in the military during the Vietnam war...After arriving in town, he soon meets Kerry, a waitress who, one day, started talking to him as soon as she waited on him rather than her usual request for what he wanted...and then, whenever he came to the restaurant. One day, as he was now somewhat acquainted to her, he asked what she would do if she had seen an obituary for his mother, who had already died years ago. She said she would go to the funeral--so he did. There he saw his brother. He also saw himself, married to his long-ago girlfriend with kids...And the mystery began...As he began to try to understand his family situation, he realized that he was being followed and that the men were trying to capture him.  Somehow he would always elude them...Kerry and he were becoming closer and during a conversation explained to Bob that the author of a book they'd been discussing was dead. At first Bob couldn't believe it but shared that they had been as close as brothers. Further, that a book Bob had known he was working on had already been published, so that much that Bob had thought was top secret had already been shared across the world...One of the things that had happened when Bob had decided to come back to the States was that he began to have severe headaches and he began to have nightmares. Bob was also beginning to paint again, but he began to notice that somewhere in each painting, there was some addition that he didn't remember painting...the latest a creepy hand coming out of a bush...Since Bob continued to be followed and knew that his place had been searched, he began his own investigation, which ultimately led to a company, ISI. A minor character, a street man who was seen by most people as crazy and to be avoided, had been befriended by Bob and was the key to how Bob was able to infiltrate this research facility. Not only did he begin to gather information, he also saw the men who had been following him. Finally, Bob decided he had to go back to Thailand, to where everything seemed to have started...By that time, he and Kerry were involved and she quit her job so traveled with him.One decision by the author proved to end this story in a unique way, one that responded to the need to provide a satisfying conclusion without going into the gory details that took place. The surprise ending was not totally unexpected, since the writer had shown us over and over that there was something strange going on...But I had no clue what it was until the last major revelation was made... Leaving out the action of those final days or weeks, leaves the reader with the romantic suspense as the primary plot line. One that is memorable and, at the same time, allows us to get past what actually happened...which was too horrendous to dwell on.Kudos to Pat Bertram for effectively presenting this strange but plausible tale! If you've already read Bertram, you should consider this a must-read! Highly recommended!Book Received ViaFacebook Reviewers RoundupGABixler Reviews </p>

 <p> Bob Stark is a man searching for the truth in this psychological mystery.  After 18 years living abroad, the Vietnam veteran returns to his hometown of Denver, Colorado and discovers his late mother has died...again. Her obituary in the local newspaper sets up this well-crafted tale, in which another Bob Stark is living his life. The other Bob Stark is married to his old high school sweetheart. The other Bob Stark is attending his mother's funeral with his brother.  Why, where, what, how and, most importantly, WHO is this Bob Stark impersonater?With the assistance of a trustworthy waitress--and eventual love interest--Bob must explore his past and present to arrive at the truth.  Based on those trying to kill Bob, it's apparent others would prefer that truth never be revealed.  At first glance, Bob is just an ordinary, everday kind of guy, but as his unique and varied talents appear, he's frequently a stranger to himself.The road to discovery curves widely (literally and figuratively), and the trail of crumbs the author scatters for readers  must be followed nearly to the end before understanding dawns.  The ending is never obvious, and readers discover the truth with Bob, rather than before him.  When the puzzle pieces finally fall together in this compelling page turner, there is an immediate desire to read the novel again to revisit all the clues surely missed the first time around.I rarely read a book a second time, but do plan to give Pat Bertram's novel "more reads than one". </p>

 <p> Pat Bertram grabbed my attention at the outset and didn't let go.  The complex and intriguing plot is not difficult to follow, just impossible to predict.  Characters are enigmatic but believable.  Settings are appropriately described but not overly so.  Each chapter begs for the next to be read without ending each chapter with a "teaser".  Romance is steamy but tastefully done.  There's science fiction involved which is not so far out that some readers have even questioned how much could be true.Like the last book of Job, the epilogue brings some poetic justice and adds a bit of meaning to the plot, but the real story stands even without the epilogue.  There is not a paragraph which is not well written.  Highly recommended. </p>

 <p> I agonized over how to review this book. Over a year or so, I read her first chapter a few times and, as writer myself, wondered how she'd solve the opening dilemma...how can a man experience "more deaths than one"? Does she resort to the supernatural or slip around the question with teasing misdirection? This book is a sprawling mess of ideas (I mean that in the most complimentary way) but does it have an artist's soul? Pat stubbornly disavows any sense of artistry in her work--claiming only a workmanlike plodding, but she writes things like this:The sodium vapor lights gave Colfax Avenue an unearthly glow, like an alien world with a dying sun.- Pat Bertram, More Deaths than OneThis book is ambitious in span and filled to overflowing with ideas--the final effect is thought-provoking. It doesn't go where you think it will go and it does not end like you think it will end. Four stars.Ken Coffman is the author of Steel Waters, Glen Wilson's Bad Medicine, Toxic Shock Syndrome and Hartz String Theory. </p>

 <p> In More Deaths Than One, Pat Bertram has woven an intriguing tale of what can happen when the wrong people are given control over another's life.I felt a little anxious before I even turned that first e-page of More Deaths than One.I had never read a book written by anyone I knew before.While I've never actually met the author, Pat Bertram, in person I do consider her to be a good online friend and a valuable writing ally.What feels even odder to me than reading a published book by someone I know is sitting down and writing a review of a book written by someone I know, and one I count as an e-friend to boot.  It's even worse than that initial "What will they think?" phase of writing subject matter you perhaps wouldn't want to write home to mother with.And, perhaps, I should feel a little bit of guilt in not actually buying the book.  I got the e-book when she was offering it up free to anyone who wanted it.  But, I don't regret it.  Pat also never asked me to do a review on it.  This, I do of my own volition - much to her chagrin or delight, all depending on what she thinks of my review I guess.And so, with a small amount of trepidation, I turned that first e-page and eased my way into what may conceivably have turned into a dead man's life.Our hero, Bob Stark, is mostly notable for his very essence of being un-notable.  In fact, he is so un-notable that even the people who know him seem to have trouble recognizing him when they first see him.  This very plainness draws you in, making you like him for his simplicity and empathize with him for that unwanted feeling of invisibility that we all share at times.His ordinariness also proves to be essential to the story.  In fact, his very plainness plays you right into believing the possibility of the truth that comes out later in the story. You'll have to read the story to find out why.The story starts with the very ordinary Bob Stark having a very ordinary hot chocolate in the Rimrock Coffee Shop, where his solitude is intruded on by his waitress making a rather ordinary attempt at flirting with him.Unfortunately for Stark, the ordinariness of his life ends there.Stark learns from the newspaper that his mother, Lydia Stark, has passed away - again.  Yes, after burying his mother once already, the woman apparently has died a second time, 22 years later.Convinced it has to be a hoax, Stark decides to show up for his mother's second funeral.All the usual people are at the funeral, friends and family, including Stark's old college girlfriend Lorena Jones.  Stark watches the funeral as an outsider only to find himself with more than one shock.  Not only does the funeral appear to be entirely real, the man his old girlfriend is with comes as a big shock too.  Bob Stark finds himself staring at none other than Bob Stark.  But how can this be?  How can he be watching himself at his own mother's second funeral?Stark soon finds himself pulled along an inevitable series of events, his newly befriended waitress Kerry Casillas at his side.Stark's search for the truth draws him deeper into a web of secrecy, and deeper into danger as the pair find themselves trying to stay one step ahead of someone who seems intent on catching them.He soon learns that the road to the truth lies in his own past, a past he in part has to rediscover as if learning it for the first time.Bob and Kerry travel to Thailand in search of answers that lead only to deeper questions.The answers to the mystery prove to be as shocking as looking at yourself at your own mother's second funeral.In More Deaths Than One, Pat Bertram has woven an intriguing tale of what can happen when the wrong people are given control over another's life.More Deaths Than One is published by Second Wind Publishing, LLC. </p>

 <p> Picture this: You return to the U.S. after an extended overseas trip and who do you see? You. Not in the mirror, but out there in the world. And bad guys are looking for you, the you in the mirror while the other you goes about his life with the past you remember.Welcome to the world of Robert Stark, who goes by the name "Bob," the starkly mannered, dream-haunted protagonist of Pat Bertram's intricate novel about a man who returns to the United States after 18 years in southeast Asia only to find that he appears to be under investigation by a shadowy government or quasi-government agency.Welcome to the world of Kerry Casillas, the good natured and intuitive-reader-of-people waitress who works the graveyard shift at the Rimrock Coffee Shop in Denver where Bob Stark comes to escape from his nightmares.It will not take you long to guess that Bob and Kerry are likely to become increasingly significant in each other's lives. In this matter, your guess will be correct. You will be tempted to guess again, primarily about where this mystery is heading and how, logically, there can be more than one Bob Stark, and just what it is that the man sitting there in the Rimrock Coffee Shop reading his mother's obituary in the newspaper has or has done that might place him within the cross-hairs of increasingly rough operatives.The obituary is problematic, for Bob Stark's mother died and was buried years ago. Keeping himself well hidden within lilac bushes, Bob attends the burial service at Mountain View Cemetary. His brother Jackson is there. Robert Stark is also there, married to Bob's former girl friend Lorena. "Bob stared," writes Bertram. "The other Robert Stark seemed to have aged a bit faster than he, seemed more used, but the resemblance could not be denied. He was looking at himself."Also there, just past the casket is a new headstone for Bob's long-dead mother. Bob wonders "What the hell is going on?"When you reach the end of the book, you will see just how perfectly the puzzle pieces of Bob Stark's dangerous and shattered world fit together. Until then, you will ask the same questions Bob Stark is asking, and you will experience the same limbo he feels as the answers elude him. All of this will happen because Bertram has crafted a suspenseful story where everything that's real isn't what it seems. </p>

 <p> I bought this book for my Kindle about a year ago, and I wish I'd read it sooner, because it is a great story. From almost the moment you start reading to the very last page, you find yourself addicted, trying to find out what exactly is happening and where it will go. At the same time you find yourself really rooting for these characters, hoping good things will happen to them and cheering for them during the bad times as you watch them solve this intriguing puzzle of military scandal, deceptions, and a conspiracy dating back to the war in Vietnam and a corporation that will do anything to silence its enemies.I only have two criticisms. One is that at times, you think that the villains protagonist Bob Stark has to face would be a bit smarter or deadlier than how they're portrayed. The other is that the conclusion of the novel may leave you wanting a little more, especially if you prefer big, epic climaxes with the hero and the bad guy duking it out. But other than that, this is a superb novel and I'll have to read more by the author when I get the chance. </p>

 <p> The first three pages of "More Deaths than One" have to constitute a serious contender for the best opening scene of a novel. Two main characters are introduced, a garrulous waitress and a taciturn hot-chocolate customer. They meet. She talks, a lot. He reads the paper. "And Lydia Loretta Stark was dead. Again." With two such immediately real and appealing characters, and a line like that, I'd challenge anyone not to want to keep turning the pages.And then, even though the characters are already fully formed, the author proceeds to add layer upon layer of depth and history. The taciturn Bob has nightmares, paints pictures with mysteries inside, and tells stories as if he's reading them from a book. His faithful sidekick Kerry teases out information and ideas. And a hint of the truth pokes its head up enticingly. I wondered, could he? Maybe...Particularly well done is the scene near the end where the real story unfolds. Kerry switches from misplaced to well-placed anger with hardly a pause, her reaction so humanly believable, and the truth so strange it leaves the reader wondering, even after it's been told.Read this book in the knowledge that Pat Bertram is a skilled story-teller. No hint, no strangeness, no odd surprise or character is wasted, but everything points to and leads to the final conclusion. A masterful tale that truly fulfills the promise of its beginning. </p>

 <p> You have got to read this novel, More Deaths Than One.  Who has stolen Bob Stark's identity? Why is he being pursued by the henchmen of a shadowy multinational corporation? What does it have to do with his old friends from his brutal days of service in Vietnam?  These are but a few of the exquisite and tantalizing questions and scenarios painted  and which must be answered in Pat Bertram's riveting and excellent new novel, More Deaths than one.Try to put yourself into Bob Starke's shoes.  Your mother died more than 20 years ago and you actually attended her funeral, at that time.  Then, you travel to South East Asia where you end up staying for eighteen years, only to return and discover that your long lost mom has just died again and another you is at her funeral.  Sound startling, eerie or suspenseful?  Believe me; if you start reading this tremendous read, you will not want to stop until it is completely finished.  It is one of the best novels I have ever read in years.As a novelist, one of the most important things a writer must do is to grab the reader's attention, on the first page.  Pat Bertram's novel, More Deaths Than One certainly hooked me immediately.  Bertram has a natural talent and has created a story that gets readers deeply into the story and holds them. Her plot and her very realistic characters took my total concentration.  The characters are so fascinating, attention-grabbing and human.  By the end of the book, I felt as if I knew them well and for a long time.  I am convinced that if the reading public learns about this spellbinding new novel, a very large number of people will want to read it and Pat Bertram will have a best seller.  I consider her to be one of the smartest writers I have had the pleasure of meeting.I think we will read a lot more from this excellent storyteller, Pat Bertram.  She has stated that when the traditional publishers stopped publishing her favorite type of books that are character and story driven novels, which can't easily be slotted into a genre, she decided to write her own. She certainly achieved her goal, with More Deaths Than One.  The residents of Pat Bertram's native Colorado, where she is a lifelong resident have much to be proud of, from one of their own. There are many words that come to mind to describe this powerful and suspenseful novel, such as exciting, powerful, suspenseful or mesmerizing.  But, without a doubt, the best word I can use to describe More Deaths Than One by Pat Bertram is nothing less than Superb.Author Steven Clark BradleyNimrod RisingPatriot ActsStillBorn!Probable Cause </p>
