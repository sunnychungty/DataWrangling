 <p> The 2013 move to his high rise apartment in the dead of a Montana winter left M.E.S. with no dictionary.  I spent several weeks going through the large print dictionary's Amazon.com had offered for sale to send him as a gift.  When I chose and sent M.E.S. the Webster's New Explorer Large Print Dictionary his response was, 'The new dictionary has new words listed according to their area of use and meaning in a separate section in the front of the book.  It is a very handy feature.&#34; </p>

 <p> It is good to have a book that is easy to read and also has more information in it than my outdated dictionaries.  It's big and bulky, but it certainly is worth it. </p>

 <p> I bought this as a gift for a family member and she were delighted. We thought it would be really heavy because it is large print, but it is fairly light, which is wonderful. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I purchased this dictionary for my son, who loves to read actual paper books (no Kindle dictionary!), but doesn't need long definitions of words or their etymologies. The large print makes it easy for him to locate the words and the font is clear and easy to read. I definitely recommend it for anyone who would like to have an easy-to-use dictionary. </p>

 <p> Thank you for this wonderful dictionary.  I gave my other Dictionary's away.  Had to use a Microscope to use them.  Now I have one with large print!  Yeah Thank you for the fast & courteous service. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I love to read and I love to discover new words. The print is just too small and the weight just too heavy for the dictionary I have now (American Heritage) so I thought, hmmm how about a large-print version for guys like me? Well, this &#34;Large Print Dictionary&#34; is not the one! Every third word I look up isn't in it and the the definition of the ones that are are WAY abbreviated. Bottom line: pretty useless unless you're a myopic, rather weak grade-schooler (no offense intended, I assure you).PS: Even the Introduction admits to &#34;brevity&#34; saying its necessary. Really, why? </p>
