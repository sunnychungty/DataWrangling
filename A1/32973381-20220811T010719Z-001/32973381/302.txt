 <p> Ken Mooney's ability to coin a phrase is outstanding.  Throughout this epic tale of demi-gods fighting against the goddess of procreation, he manages to build emotions, actions, and a fantastic world one feels instantly connected with.From the opening prologue, the reader is pulled into a tale that could have been written by Homer himself, gods at war with each other, battling for supremacy.  He moves on from there to a more modest setting, but doesn't keep us there for long, as we suddenly find our protagonists squaring off against the exact same foe that Zeus and Hera found themselves struggling to contain. . . Aphrodite.And Aphrodite is where this tale really hits its stride.  In this goddess, Mooney has managed to create a villain that the reader both immediately hates and yearns to learn more about.  She uses everything at her disposal to get her way, and even has an evil henchman to assist her dastardly deeds.By the end of the book we are stuck craving the next piece of this tale.  I can only hope that Mooney doesn't take too long to give us what we desire. </p>

 <p> This book was a ride.  Sometimes, I thought it was absolutely amazing.  I loved some of the phrasing and description.  Early on, Aphrodite is referred to as a "beauty of superlatives" and I thought my head would explode with how awesome that was.In general, Aphrodite was pretty awesome.  She was a character that I could really sink my teeth into and feel for.  However, that didn't come until about 50% into the book.From about 50-60% of the book, I was riveted.  The author provided all these vignettes (he did this again around 90%), and they were gorgeous.  I came to the conclusion that Mooney is best when he's capturing a particular segment in time - a particular mood, scene, character.  The day-to-day stuff was a lot harder to get into.  But those vignettes - wow, they were gorgeous.Cover - sure, yeah. It works.Title - Makes sense.Characters:Protagonist - There were a lot of them.  I had a hard time really "feeling" for most of them.  Part of this was how much was going on.  Part of it was the way they were described - like the reader already knew them. Phrases would tell us what was and was not common, and how he or she felt - we didn't get to see these things, they were told to us. (see above - the vignettes made everything better.  I cared so much more once I saw (show, don't tell!) these past episodes.Antagonist - She was one hawt lady.  I mean. Yum.  Aphrodite was brilliant. Most of her was right.  I was really annoyed that she was just a psycho, but about halfway through the book, she suddenly wasn't (backstory is amazing).  And by the end, I really felt that I understood her.  However, she was the only character that I really "got" completely and felt for with any great immediacy.Did I mention that she was hot? Sadistic and hot.Plot - The pacing for the book felt weird.  As I have mentioned previously, it took a while to get heated up.  The things that happened in the "past" were infinitely better written/described than the present.  It was really weird.  I was hooked pretty quickly with the intro, then I was struggling, then I was really into it, and then struggling again.  From 80-90% of the book was a single showdown.  It took forever. Then there were the repercussion vignettes, which were pretty excellent, and then the end of the book.  I think if Mooney honed his present tense, happening now scenes, the book would be a lot better.  I really enjoyed huge segments of the book, and then I found other segments pretty hard to move through.Other Notes - This is a part of a series.  I don't actually mind that, but I did feel that the conclusion of the book, especially for the lack of resolution, was a long time coming.  I was hard pressed to think of what had taken so many pages.Value - This book is currently $1.99 for Kindle  (also, it is prime eligible).It is definitely worth buying.  It's not a perfect book, by any means, but the author has some clear talent.  He mentions that this is his first book.  I think that he's someone to watch, because the man can turn a phrase. </p>

 <p> Godhead; Ken Mooney5-stars; Finished 10/12/2013Mooney&#8217;s Godhead is a written, modern reflection of such idyllic classics as Homer&#8217;s Iliad and Odyssey with an action sensibility better suited for the 21st century remake of the 80&#8217;s mythological phenom. Clash of the Titans. It is complex and convoluted; obviously written with great care for detail and mythological accuracy, with the expected creative license molding minor things to propel the storyline.Sections written with the classical sensibility are interwoven with modern day descriptors; Mooney is especially adept at drawing the reader in and out like a well-oiled sewing machine. The story that evolves from his style is fluid backstory, modern action and lyrical prose. At times, I feel the prose is better suited for the actual Iliad or Odyssey rather than a current work; however, it also further enforces Mooney&#8217;s great love of the classics.When reading Godhead, I was attracted to certain characters and relationships, particularly because these certain characters and relationships experienced marked transformation as the storyline unfolded.Megan is the undeniable MC, but I also find her taking a secondary, supportive role at times throughout the text.  More than any character, she experiences a transformation that not only changes her personally, but also the dynamic between herself and others, namely her mother, Sandra. In the beginning, Megan is definitely the quiet/distractible type; her mind pulled in many directions, not the least of which is her grandfather&#8217;s death. As the story unfolds and Megan is drawn deeper into the world of magic and mythology, she reads her grandfather&#8217;s journey and discovers within herself a power- both real and emotional. She shines and suffers as the end draws near, becoming less protected sheep and more leader. I especially appreciated that Megan was the one that realized Aphrodite&#8217;s plan toward the end of the book.Sandra, Megan&#8217;s mother, I can see being an easily looked-over character, but she is essential.  Megan&#8217;s father, Bryan, wanted nothing more than a normal, safe childhood for his daughter, but his demise, his death at the hands of the demon Deimos, inevitably tracks Megan. Sandra has done her best to honor Bryan&#8217;s wishes; keep their daughter away from the pain of the knowledge of his death, her abilities, her destiny. Sandra&#8217;s biggest transformation is the realization that she is small in the scheme of her daughter&#8217;s fate; she has done what she can to protect her daughter, but  now must accept that her role is finished. The dynamic between mother and daughter is irrevocably altered by Megan&#8217;s reading of her grandfather&#8217;s diary, bloom into magic and actions toward the end of the book to take revenge against her father&#8217;s killer.I feel like Mooney foreshadows this relationship change by creating a deliberate separation between mother and daughter in joint scenes. The last scene between mother and daughter is especially touching; Megan sobbing for what has come to pass and Sandra&#8217;s protective, regretful words: &#8216;I never wanted you to have to.&#8217;I&#8217;m sure many people focus on Aphrodite; she&#8217;s the villain, a quintessential &#8216;bad guy&#8217; full of piss and vinegar. I find she&#8217;s a bit more clever than some classic bad guys though, deliberately misleading her enemies until they fulfill her wishes without even realize it. She&#8217;s a well-written character; Mooney makes sure that readers pinpoint her as the focus of dislike, urging his readers to &#8216;root for the good guy.&#8217;Several other characters warrant mentioning: Karl, misunderstood and brooding, searching for his past. Hannah, daughter of Hera, an orphan whose will for revenge against Aphrodite allows her anger to change her fundamentally away from good.Now, going into this, one must realize that Godhead is not a standalone piece; it is meant to progress and continue into subsequent works. Because of this, some readers might find the ending leaves more questions than answers.I am one of those readers, but, like with any classic quest, I plan to bide my time patiently, toil past the Kraken bravely and grab the golden fleece that will be Mooney&#8217;s follow-up work: THE HADES CONTRACT. </p>

 <p> Ken Mooney's writing is something that most current literature is missing. With an exciting plot and interesting setting, Mooney takes full advantage of the opportunity afforded to him to create a vivid world that is unique to his book. Although a fairly full genre, Mooney's description puts his Olympus above many others. A vivid book that makes use of all the senses. I love the Sherrilyn Kenyon novels, and this book takes the fantasy elements beautifully, while creating something less niche. </p>

 <p> GODHEAD ReviewWhat struck me about Godhead is how well-written this book is. Ken Mooney is a gifted writer, no doubt. I'm really impressed with his manner of writing, ability at characterization and description. I was hooked from the beginning, both by the Prologue which was set in Olympus and by the opening chapters set in a town (or city?) of Carthin. The rest of the book doesn't disappoint as the author does a great job weaving Greek mythology with Paranormal Fantasy, setting them in modern times.The characters are really well done. I felt for Megan who lost her granddad. I was so interested in Karl who also had a person he loved and lost. Hannah and Unity are also great characters who had their mysteries. It is through the flashbacks that we get to know all these characters better. The appearance of a traitor in the book was quite a surprise to me. I totally didn't see it coming, but I'm not going to spoil the fun for those who are going to read this novel.There's lots of action in the book, and I enjoyed the scenes as they were visual and I could easily see everything I was reading about as if I was watching a movie. And the ending leaves me wanting for more.GODHEAD is such an impressive mix of Greek mythology, fantasy and horror that I'm sure this book will stay with me long after I've finished reading it. I definitely look forward to reading Book 2 in the series. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> *I received a free pdf copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review*I love urban fantasy. I love Greek Mythology. I love horror. This book sounded as if it had elements of all three so I was looking forward to it.The Gods of Olympus have been betrayed by Aphrodite, who lets demons in to their home to destroy them all. The last throw of the dice for Hera is to seal in the demons and expel the rest of the gods to live in the mortal world. Fast forward to the present day and Aphrodite has been killing all the descendants of the Gods to give her the power to return to rule Olympus and set the demons on the world. A group of talented people must continue the battle...if they can learn how to use their skills in time.There is a lot of good about this book. The descriptions of Olympus and the Gods are vivid and detailed without the dreaded info dumps. Flashbacks are spaced out and used to give only important backstory about the characters and past events. It was a good use of that resource. The author's descriptions are well worded and easy to imagine and the characters are well developed with the clever use of grief as a way to bring them closer together. That was a nice touch. Aphrodite herself is an excellent evil character and her flashbacks give her depth and help the reader to understand why she did what she did. Each of the characters have great potential which I assume will develop in the next book. I developed opinions of the characters which shifted and changed with the plot, which was enjoyable. It was also interesting to see the powers being used and it gave you an idea of the real potential within this group.There was a bit of an issue for me with the way the dialogue was presented. During conversations, words were continually highlighted in italics to tell the reader where to put the emphasis in the sentence. I feel that was unnecessary. If the dialogue is good, the reader will know what your characters are saying and the emotions they are feeling. It's not necessary to spell it out to us, especially with good descriptive work throughout the book.There were a lot of unfinished sentences during the conversations which annoyed me a bit, along with half explanations that would cut off. I wanted to yell 'spit it out already!' on quite a few occasions! This was especially true when Unity and Hannah were explaining things to Megan and Karl in the most confusing manner and our two heroes just weren't asking the questions I wanted answers to. While I thought that this bit was frustrating, it might have been the author's way to avoid big info dumps, or it was the intended plot device to space out what we learn. Either way it didn't spoil the actual story. I am a bit impatient when I want to know what is happening which I guess is good as it means I was getting into the story.OVERVIEWA few niggles aside, I did like the story and I am interested enough to look for book 2. This is not an action filled book like some urban fantasy but I'd describe it as a slow burner that keeps you interested all the time. The second half of the book is fast moving due to short sections and switching POV.For readers who are interested, the sexual content is minor:a partial short sex scene, while the rest is more implied than described fully. Swearing is minimal and used purely for effect, which was good. A few gory bits when the demons attack. Suitable for older teens and adults. </p>

 <p> This book really grabbed me and, as a debut novel, it impressed me. To start with I found Megan slightly irritating with her lack of 'get up and go' but I warmed to her in the end. Karl comes across as a rather befuddled bloke who doesn't know what day of the week it is but I still liked him for it. Made a change from the usual male hero.The story itself is a fabulous tale involving gods most of us are familiar with (who knew Aphrodite was such a vixen? Ah...) and their descendants. Megan and Karl are thrown together by different circumstances towards the Circle, who are there to protect the descendants of the Gods.The description and destruction of Olympus is graphic and believable. The bits in the book which touch on the mythology and describe events from that era are really striking in the way they fire up imagination. I could see the whole scene clearly.This book is action packed from start to finish with descriptive writing which let me taste the air in this story. It's well thought out, never loses momentum and, as you can tell, I really loved it. </p>

 <p> Godhead. What an intensely fantastic read. I was first introduced to Greek Mythology in Middle School years ago. It was when I was first becoming interested in Star Wars and Marvel Superheroes and I remember being just fascinated with the history of the Greek Gods and the films I watched with the class. Fast-forward years upon years in time until I discover Godhead.This book brought that wonder and awe back to the forefront for me, and more than that, I am now going to actively search out more books involving Olympus and the gods because of the thrill I&#8217;ve had here. Mooney&#8217;s release of Godhead&#8217;s sequel, The Hades Contract, can&#8217;t come soon enough.The book ramps and builds suspense. Aphrodite and Hannah were my favorite characters, both intense and wonderful, and as this book came to a close I was on the edge of my seat, imbedded in the action.Mooney writes Olympus in high form. </p>

While there's never any doubt who's committing the evils, if you're not careful you'll start to find your loyalties divided.The action is tense, and the descriptions are vivid. This isn't a book to rush through, but take your time and enjoy it. </p>

 <p> I enjoyed this book even though it isn't something that I would normally pick up and read. The cover however, attracted me to it, and the catch line just sounded epic!I finished the story with a smile on my face and questions in my mind, which as a writer is exactly what you want.It crossed genres, which I personally love, though for a writer it can be harder to market, but it works sooooo well.The concept was original and the characters interesting enough for me to invest strong emotions towards. Aphrodite is a fantastic and cleverly written villain,  and probably my favourite character.It's clear that Ken put an awful lot of his own love and knowledge of greek mythology into writing this novel, and it shows.Will I pick up the next one? Heck yeah! </p>

 <p> I enjoy a twist to the known mythology and gods of old, so this option to review a mystery dealing with the gods of Olympia was too good to pass up.  Ken Mooney has set up a story that will come to an epic trial for humanity.Years ago, the demonic forces, with help from Aphrodite defeated the Olympians in a power struggle, and Hera stepped forward to sacrifice Olympus and the source of their power to banish the demons and save humanity.As all good sacrifices seemingly don&#8217;t change ulterior motives, the demons are back again, with Aphrodite still helping to plan the destruction of humankind.  Anyone who has read any mythology at all knows that the Olympians were a randy lot, and tales suggest that they left several descendants scattered throughout the world.  It is these descendants that are the only ones standing between Aphrodite and the demonic forces and the destruction of humans.Epic battles, demi-gods and demons, questions about their motivations and a rogue Aphrodite are just some of the positives, and a liberal sprinkling of Greek mythology will keep you thinking.  Unfortunately, the pace of the action is slowed dramatically by the prose:  too many flashbacks and explanations better used as show, details that are overworked without purpose and some stilted dialogue all contributed to make this book longer than it needed to be.Flashbacks are wonderful, but when used correctly and not substitutes for character and plot development. While the information that we receive in them is useful, there seems to be a point at which the author hadn&#8217;t solidly plotted the series: many of the extended flashbacks that give all sorts of points of view and build or develop the world slow the battle to nothing, and the promise of the prologue and story are missed.It was a long read, and while interesting, I found a great lack of focus: this book does not reflect the promising synopsis, and is instead laden with background information that serves to pull the reader away from the conflict which is the main focus of the series.I received an eBook from the author for purpose of honest review. I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions are my own responsibility. </p>

The main character's lack of info from Grandpa also felt weird.  Maybe this book gets better if you finish it, however I lost interest in these characters and their convoluted mythology. </p>

 <p> When I looked at this book, I though, what an interesting concept.  Then I read the book and was totally under whelmed.  I think it would have been much more interesting of a read, had the plot line not been all over the place.  The characters a underdeveloped, especially the demi gods. The one character in the story that is fully developed is the Goddess Aphrodite and she is one of the secondary characters.  Still, the book left me under whelmed. </p>

 <p> First of all thank you so much to Mr Mooney for sending me a copy of this book to review.When I first started this novel I wasnt sure it was going to be for me, whilst I do love a good fantasy novel I'm a bit picky! The news on this one is - its GOOD.Aphrodite has betrayed the Gods and in a last ditch attempt to save them Hera expels the remaining Gods to the mortal world . After some time has passed Aphrodite is on a mission to kill all the descendants and give her the power to return to Olympus and release the demons trapped there upon the world at large. The only thing standing in her way is a small group of eclectic people who do not really understand how to use the power they have..And so the scene is set. This was quite a slow moving story, using flashback to good effect and building the characters in an interesting way. As the start of a series, I felt that this was cleverly done - I was especially fond of the attention given to Aphrodite and her back story - motivation for characters in a novel is always important I feel. The best villains have the most intriguing reasons...I don't want to give the impression that this book has no action. It has and plenty of it. Mr Mooney's descriptive talents are top notch - The nightclub scenes in particular I felt were very well written and drew you straight into the heart of what was going on. The "hero powers" our descendants have are varied and matched perfectly to their protagonists. I really would love the ability to slow down time - hey how many books would I get in then? The whole story kept me interested and intrigued to the end...a terrific first instalment. I don't know much about actual Mythology it has to be said, beyond watching the classic "Clash of the Titans" film but certainly I have now developed an interest in finding out more - I think this will add greatly to my enjoyment of the future books in this series.All in all a great read - the only minor negatives for me were slightly over egging the pudding with descriptive prose on occasion and also some of the dialogue didnt flow quite as well as perhaps it could...I think that is a side effect that some self published novels suffer from but it didnt detract from the enjoyment and I would certainly recommend picking this up if you like a good fantasy novel, with a mythology base and a bit of an adventure....Happy Reading Folks! </p>

 <p> I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I'm a big fan of mythology, and have been for a long time, so the premise behind this book really appealed to me, and I'm glad to say it did not disappoint! To start out, one of my favorite things about this book is the main villain.  Aphrodite is absolutely perfect in her role, and although reading some of the old Greek myths, one may think it odd that she is the main antagonist, the author came up with a great reason for it. Even better, she is not the kind of villain you just hate.  You can understand why she is doing everything that she does.The various descendents of the Olympians were also well written, although I would like to see more information about who each character was descended from.  At the end of the book, I believe there are only two that are known, and I'd like to know more.The book had enough action and intrigue to keep my interest for long periods of time, and I can't wait for the next book in the series.  Highly recommended </p>

 <p> * I received a free eCopy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review *Oh My Gods! This book was amazing! Ken Mooney has written a powerful novel seamlessly weaving together fact and fiction in epic proportions.Godhead is a richly written story about the fall of the Gods of Olympus. Aphrodite along with her army of shadows wreak destruction on Olympus forcing the other Gods to make the ultimate sacrifice. Olympus itself and their status as Gods. They are forced to live on Earth as mortals where Aphrodite continues to seek her revenge on them killing off entire bloodlines. Olympus' fate lies in the hands of the children of those Gods. Some who want nothing to do with that task or the responsibilities that go along with it.I loved everything about this book. It was so well written. the characters were amazing. In the beginning, I thought that Hannah was my favorite but by the end it was definitely Unity. As you peeled away all of her may layers, you couldn't help but cheer for her and want her to succeed.This story was so complex that I could sit and talk about it for hours. Instead, I'll just tell you my favorite part. There's a place near the middle of the book where you get to see a different side of Aphrodite. Aphrodite before she became the Aphrodite we've been reading about. Though you can never find yourself on her side, you get a better understanding of the whys. I loved that closer look at her past and personal life.Godhead is a MUST read. I will shout this book's praises from the rooftops. I can't wait to read book two, The Hades Contract! </p>

 <p> Imagine what would happen in a mash-up of The X-Men, Percy Jackson, and Nicholas Flamel, with a dash of Homer just for the fun of it. Ken Mooney's intelligent and action-packed adult novel starts with the destruction of Olympus, the home of the ancient gods; brings a vengeful Aphrodite, accompanied by blood-thirsty demons, into the 21st century; and then sets her against the descendants of those same gods. Aphrodite must kill all the descendants before she can reclaim her home at Olympus. The result: mass murder, "collateral damage," utter destruction -- starting with a NYC nightclub and ending just days later with a good portion of Greece. It reminded me of Dr. Peter Venkman in Ghostbusters: "... a disaster of biblical proportions."Humankind's only hope is those descendants Aphrodite wants to wipe out, whose special powers include the ability to slow down or speed up time, perform mind melds, create force fields, and so on. Yet two, Megan and Karl, have only just discovered their heritage, and at first they're repulsed by what it means. They're also frustratingly slow in learning to control their powers. Will they come up to speed in time to stop the Goddess of The-Flip-Side-of-Love?Mooney, who has a degree in English Studies from Trinity College in Dublin, tweaks the Greek gods' family trees to build motivation and sprinkles Homeric references (including his own invocations of the Muse) and quotes from Stan Lee and James Whalen throughout. These are fun to spot, if you can tear yourself from the story.Godhead is the first of a series. The ending allows you to take a breath, but you can't help thinking about all those demons on the loose, not to mention Aphrodite at the height of her power. The sequel promises to take readers for another break-neck ride through Greek mythology, running rampant through an unsuspecting world.Lizzie Ross, from The Kindle Book ReviewThe Kindle Book Review received a free copy of this book for an independent, fair, and honest review.
