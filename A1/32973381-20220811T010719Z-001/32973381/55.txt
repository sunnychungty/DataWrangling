 <p> I previously owned the Pentax *istDL, which is almost the same shape, but this new model has advanced in so many ways. Most importantly, the ISO rating goes to 12,800. You can get excellent shots (web use) even at 6,400. This camera is a breeze to use and its small size makes it good for carrying around. If you have old Pentax lenses, they'll fit, although the aperture will be set on wide open and can't be adjusted for the really old lenses.The video (24 fps) is good. </p>

 <p> I have been using point and shoot super-zooms in the past like Canon s2IS, Fz28, Fz35. The image quality became more and more important to me especially with the increase of mega-pixels since image noise is more evident. My Pentax DSLR is very different in positive and negative ways.On the positive side I am thrilled about the responsiveness of this camera and i realized that I've been missing this on the point and shoots especially when it comes to flash recharge time or shot to shot lag. The KX is exceptional in every aspect such as auto focus, shutter lag and continuous shooting. The HD video is a bonus but is a bit awkward to use since the zooming is not very smooth and you have to focus manually. The jelly  effect is also evident. I'd love to have a dedicated movie button tho.On the negative side to me compared to my older super-zooms is the fact that you have to change the lenses to suit your shooting situation. I still have to get used to it. I know there are super zoom lenses like the Tamron 18-270 but indoors they are not very fast. I guess that also goes for the 18-55 kit lens. The 18-55 and 50-200 kit lenses really produce good quality images. They are the sharpest between f 5.6 and f9 to my experience. The shutter sound is a bit on the loud side, I can no longer take silent images but it's a matter of getting used to it. The size of the camera does not bother me, I think it's decent for an APS-C sized sensor DSLR.I know some are not happy with the fact that the KX uses AA batteries but I can say that stick with Eneloops and they'll do a very good job. I probably shot between 400-600 images on one charge. The good thing about them is that they don't lose their charge as ordinary NiMh rechargeable.The camera does not come with video cable so if you are planning to play your images and videos on the TV you'll have to purchase one separately.Overall it's very exciting to learn about DSLR's, the image quality is exceptional, my FZ35 on ISO 400 was producing the noise level of ISO 3200 of the KX. This is not to make the FZ35 look bad, as a point and shoot is the best you can get in my opinion, I'm just trying to illustrate the difference between the image quality due to the sensor size. This camera is great to start with since is more beginner friendly with scene mode shooting options and a pretty good Auto mode.As far as the purchase, Amazon is excellent as far as the quality of customer service and order processing time. So far I had the best experience with online shopping with Amazon. 5 star rating! </p>

 <p> Lot of people look at Canon or Nikon while trying to buy their first DSLR because it is a safe bet. However if they do that, they will overlook a wonderful little camera the Pentax K-x. Like most, my main focus was Canon or Nikon when I started looking for my first DSLR but heeding to the advice of my friend and also by the ratings in [...] I was swayed towards Pentax.First of all this is a really small and light camera. You have to hold it in your hand to believe it. It is even smaller than my previous Panasonic bridge camera.I bought the camera with two lenses 18-55 and 50-200. For a novice, the camera and lens are just a boon. It is light to carry around everywhere and the picture quality is great. I see great details in the photos from the 12 MP CMOS sensor. The camera is quite fast. There is live view but better not use it if you are photographing something dynamic. For a static object you can use the Live view which has a face detection capability as well.The video is one of the best things about the camera. I did not expect it to take such crisp and clear videos. I am pleasantly surprised by the quality. Though it can capture 4 GB of video at a stretch, the quality is really nice. </p>

 <p> Awesome K-X </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> I recently upgraded from my beloved Olympus e-510 DSLR with the 14-42mm and 40-150mm kits lenses in order to get a DSLR with better low-light performance and HD video capabilities. I loved my Olympus, but image quality took a nose-dive at ISO 800, and I liked the idea of having an HD camcorder built into my camera to capture high quality family photos and home videos in one device. I eventually settled on the Pentax K-x after first buying, and then returning, a Canon T2i.I know that the T2i costs almost twice as much as the K-x, and they're not direct competitors, but I think my experience illustrates what a great camera and bargain the K-x is and how, for me at least, it was a giant killer.I initially pre-ordered a T2i for the $900 MSRP after reading the glowing reviews in the press about the 18MP sensor, the high-ISO performance and the killer 1080p video. When I received the T2i, I was surprised by how cheap and plasticky it felt. It's not that the T2i was likely to fall apart, but my Olympus felt and looked like a higher quality camera, even though it was about $200 less than the T2i when I bought it. I realize that the T2i is a Rebel, but for almost $1000, I expected something more solid.Even worse was the Canon 18-55mm kit lens, which felt like a toy compared to my Olympus kit lenses. It looked cheap, and the zoom action felt very cheap, and you could hear plastic-on-plastic as you zoomed in and out. There was no lens hood included, and the optional lens hood was only about an inch deep and looked ridiculous. The front element rotated when auto-focusing, which makes using some filters problematic, and you had to switch off AF to manually make focus adjustments. My Olympus lenses did not rotate the front element, and allowed full time focus override without turning off AF. And build-wise, they looked and felt like a higher end lens. But worst of all, Canon kits lens's optical performance was lacking, rendering the 18MP sensor moot.I could live with the cheap feel of the T2i body and the ugly jelly-bean design, but I came to realize that in order to get a lens that would match the performance of the body, I would need to shell out another $500 or more, and as a hobbyist I just didn't have the budget.The real deal-breaker with the T2i though, was the use of Quicktime format for the HD video. Quicktime is a proprietary Apple video format, and while I must assume it works well on a new Mac, the QT videos often gave PCs problems. I'd read about this from other users, but I figured that with my high-end PCs and my computer knowledge, I would be okay. But both my new Sony Vaio laptop with Windows 7, ATI 4650 graphics and 4GB of RAM and my desktop computer with Windows XP, dual-core processor, 4GB of RAM, Raptor 10K HDD and nVidia 8800GT graphics would stutter on playback of the 1080p files. And finding affordable programs to edit Quicktime HD video files is another headache. I wasn't about to buy a new Mac just to be able to work with the video from my new camera.So back went the T2i, and my quest for a new camera continued. I was just about to pull the trigger on a Nikon D5000, when I came across the Pentax K-x.The first thing that grabbed my attention was the styling. I thought the red was killer, but I wasn't that brave. And the camera looked dead-sexy in navy blue, but when I saw the white version, I was in love. One thing I liked about my Olympus was that it was something DIFFERENT than all the Nikons and Canon Rebels you see every other parent carrying to school or sports functions. I would often get questions about it from people who didn't realize that Olympus even MADE DSLRs. With this Pentax, I would again have something out of the ordinary.Then I started reading reviews of the K-x. One of the great things about the T2i is the high ISO image quality, and according to the reviews and the sample images I was looking at, the K-x was right there with it.And the K-x also did HD video. There were some limitations, such as 720p and lack of full control over exposure while shooting video, but I didn't really mind since the samples I downloaded looked great, even on my 110" 1080P home theater projector. And 720p files take less space than 1080p and require less processing power to playback and edit. And best of all, the K-x uses Motion JPEG video format, which plays back great on PCs and is compatible with almost any Windows video editing program. The MJPEG format does use more disk space than the equivalent QT file, but hard drives and SD cards are cheap these days, so it's not a big deal.Another great thing about the K-x is that it has sensor-based image stabilization in the body, so any lens you stick on the camera is stabilized. My Olympus used a similar system, and I was very happy with it. The big advantage is that you can be non-stabilized lenses so they'll be smaller, lighter, and less expensive.I ended up buying the K-x in white with the 18-55mm lens. The K-x looks and feels like a higher quality camera than the T2i, and matches my Olympus in this department. The kit lens is also a very worthy piece of hardware.With the money I saved on the Pentax, I was able to buy the legendary Tamron 28-75mm F2.8 lens, a Pentax 55-300mm zoom lens, and a Sigma speedlight. The flash was new, but I got great deals on the slighty-used lenses on eBay and Craigslist.I've been using the Pentax for a couple months now, and have taken hundreds of pictures. I am absolutely thrilled with the camera and couldn't be happier with the photos and videos I'm getting. The T2i did have just slightly more detail, but other than that I would say the K-x has equal image quality. And the 12MP RAW image files of the K-x are faster to work with than the 18MP files of the T2i and take up much less space on SD cards, so you don't have to worry about filling up nearly as fast.That's not too much negative I can say about the camera. I would like it to have a mini-HDMI port and a standard mini-USB port, and continuous auto-focus would be nice in video mode, but no other DSLR has that yet. Stereo mics would also be nice.I suspect that the image stabilization system may not be as good as the one in my Olympus, but I can't say for sure since my 300mm is longer than the telephoto I had with the Olympus and will therefore be more prone to shake.I get compliments on the Pentax everywhere I go, and it's been a joy to use and own. I could not be happier with my purchase.In the future I'll probably add a Sigma 30mm F1.4 prime and a Sigma 10-20mm ultra-wide zoom to my lens kit.Just for the record, I'm not trying to bash on the T2i. It is an amazing camera that is currently without peer in its price range. But if you're like me and you only have about $1000 to spend, I think you will get much more value by going with a less-expensive but almost-as-capable camera like the K-x, and using the extra money on high quality lenses. My F2.8 constant-aperture lens has been a revolution for me, and I recommend every budding photographer make room in their budget for something similar. </p>

 <p> This is my first DSLR.  After many years with film cameras, I decided to move into my favorite brand: Pentax.  I was not dissapointed, the quality of the pics is excellent. As you may know, the quality of the pics depends on the quality of the lens. The kit lens that come with the camera are good and produce good pictures.  I cannot wait until I buy better lenses.  The only setback I see that does not really affect the quality of the pictures is that I cannot tell what item is focussed at all times.  I had purchased a bunch of additional lenses and hoods in Amazon that are way cheaper than the original item with the Pentax name.  I am satisfied with the purchased. I prefer to deal with Amazon dot com directly, not the vendors. However, I got great results either way. </p>

 <p> Ok, I am going to balance this a little. I had a Nikon D40, loved it, but got stolen. I saw this deal on deals2buy.com to get this pentax (plus the 50mm-200mm lens) at $560+ through the Dell website. Due to all the rave positive reviews of the k-x, I bought it! In fact, I think a reviewer actually said say that he "upgraded" from his D40 to this, so I thought wow, great price! $560 for a DSLR bundle with 50-200mm lens! The Nikon 50mm-200mm costed me $200 alone!After I received this this Pentax, I understood why people say this is a big bang for the buck. It has so many features that the D40 doesn't have, live view, video mode, all the fancy editing stuff, even HDR! BUT! The picture quality just can't match my previous D40! Yes, the Pentax has iso all the way to 6400, it goes down to iso 100 where the D40 stops at 200. But I think you will be pretty frustated with the Pentax because the focusing is really slow... I swap over to the 55-200mm pentax lens, tried to snap pictures of some birds. I can't! The focus is too slow! The birds either flew away by the time the focus is set, or when I snap it, they have moved and I ended up with a blurred picture. Even with the 18-55mm lens, the focusing is way longer than my D40! Next test, I took the Pentax out for a night shoot with my tripod at some of my favorite locations in the city. Took out my note book and set the K-x to all the previous settings I used with my D40, took the same set of pictures using my previous D40 settings. I placed the photos on my PC, and compared side by side with those pictures I took with my D40. Nope, the D40 won hands down.Final final test, I bought the Nikon D3000 with 18-55mm + 50-200mm bundle (both are VR lens). It costed me $660 from RitzCamera (through Amazon), Yes, I paid additional $100 for a camera that has less features than the Pentax just to convince myself it is not my imagination that an entry level Nikon is better than this entry level Pentax... Now, I let my wife use both cameras and start shooting stuff in her kitchen in automatic mode. She is the type who prefers point and shoot cameras, and thinks that the DSLRs are too complicated for her. After she is done shooting her microwave, iron, etc... I placed both sets of photos on the PC screen, without telling which set of photos were taken by which camera, I asked her to pick the better pictures taken by her. 8 out of 10 times, she picked the photos taken by the D3000. So, if a housewife who knows nothing about using DSLR can tell the differences between pictures taken by a D3000 vs. the K-x, I think I am convinced that I should be selling my K-x on Craglists. Since it was listed at $700 here, I sold my "used K-x" for $600, not bad considered that I bought it only $560... :)Yes, yes, I know, some of you probably grumbling right now that I haven't push the K-x to the limit, haven't picked the extreme conditions when I will appreciate the functions of the K-x. But what I am trying to say is this, if you want fancy stuff, you really get a lot of it from the K-x. If this is what you are looking for, go get the K-x. But if you want good quality pictures without having to kill yourself over the slow focusing, or IF you have used the D40 before, the K-x ain't an upgrade!Lastly, even if you are going to get the Pentax, and you are intending to get it with teh 50-200mm bundle for $699? You have been ripped off! Go deals2buy.com and wait for the promotion, I got it for only $560 for the whole bundle!And if you want to get the D3000 + 200mm lens, go Ritzcamera's website and get the bundle for $650! (For whatever reason, Amazon nolonger list that bundle...)Hope that this review can put things in a different perspective for some... </p>

 <p> I have several DSLRs (a Pentax K2000d, Nikon D300, D40 and Sony A200 and A300s) and this camera is the most enjoyable to use.  It small and light weight, it is easy to use and has a lot of fun digital filters for in camera image processing.  The camera uses the same sensor as the Nikon D300s, D300 and D90 as well as the Sony A500.What I like:- Size- Battery life- Live View is decent (not as good as Sony's implimentation)- Image quality- In camera HDR- Much of the same technology of the pricier Pentax K-7What I am not crazy about:- No LED to know which focus point is being used- AA batteries (mixed on this, easy to replace but also heavy)- No colors paired with the 55-200 lens. </p>

 <p> First, I have to say I'm an amateur photographer, so I was in the fence when the moment of buying an dslr came, I did a lot of research to finally decide and give this camera a chance. I investigated canons and nikons, but finally I came to the conclussion that this is the BEST camera in this price range for the features it has.I love taking pictures with the pentax kx, they come out very polished and with a great quality. Auto function es very good, although I never use that feature, because if you want EXCELENT photographs, you have to learn to use it in manual, if that is not the case and you want to take pictures on the go, it will be best buying a more portable camera like a sony cybershot or canon powershot.My friends and I have made very good (not perfect) short films with my camera, I record all my guitar videos with the pentax kx and they all are very nice with a great quality in high definition. One thing I noticed firt in this type of cameras is that they usually just take pictures (in this price range). But the PENTAX KX doesnt just record video, but it can record video in intervals of 25 min each, where more advance cameras like canon rebel t3i can only record for 12 consecutive minutes (according to the information provided from a friend who has one of those).One of these days I noticed a dead pixel on the screen of my camera :(...BUT dont worry! this camera has a function that is called pixel mapping and repairs dead pixels; also, it has sensor cleaning and dust removal.The lenses that come with the camera are very useful, except for the telephoto lens(50 -200mm) in the case you want to take pictures of nature in a too professional way, but it is great for portrait pictures. If that is not the case, you better buy a telephoto lens like the sigma 70-300 mm.This camera is great for long exposure photographs like photos of the night sky and HDR photography. Also, I recommend buying filters, mostly the polarizer because is a great addition to the repertory of an amateur photographer.I hope this little review help you in entering the world of professional photography like I did.  Best regards!!! </p>

 <p> After many years of point of shoot i had slowly started to get interested in the topic.  With the arrival of our first child I suddenly realized my standard point and shoot cameras were rather unsuited for taking photos of the small fellow on the move, and also the picture quality was rather grainy under low light.  I was very keen on the Canon G11 but the lack of a decent video recording capability was putting me off, plus the rather high price.I then managed to get my hands on an Olympus E420 DSLR and then found how much faster it was in focusing and shooting, and the fact that even with its smaller than other APS-C DSLR sensors the picture quality was much better, and the need to use the flash was reduced. However the lack of any form of image stabilization bothered me, as i could not get the shutter to anything less than 1/60, and it also had some major low light focusing issues.However the brief exposure to the DSLR meant i was definitely set on a DSLR and the choice was between the Nikon D5000 (one lens) and the Pentax K-x (2 lens kit) as these were the one's close to my budget.  However during that period the D5000 was having a known hardware issue with its on-off, and i decided i will go with the K-x as the reviews stated it was a good match, and the fact that the prices were so much lower even with two lenses was also an advantage.  I sadly had to opt fo rthe 50-200mm, as the prices of the 300mm spiked up during the time i purchased making it beyond my budget, but i think that was one big mistake i made!!The wider kit lens 18-55mm performs very nicely, and the picture quality is quite sharp and clear.  However the 50-200mm is a rather pathetic lens, and i see why a lot of reviews recommend people to avoid this and go for the 300mm, which i had done so!!!The K-x camera per say is super, with loads of features.  Initially i experienced the problems with the rechargeable batteries, which was rectified after i upgraded the firmware.  The next issue was that built-in image stabilization seemed very poor, so much so that i could not even get blur free photos at shutter times i had been able to with the Olympus E420. Considering that my day use camera was then the Panasonic ZS3 which could do even 1/4 sec handheld this was very disappointing.  However the firmware fix also seemed to have an impact, along with the fact that i had also to learn to grip the camera properly, and combined i now can even get blur free photos at 1/8sec using the wide angle lens.The nicest thing about the camera is its low light ability, where pictures even with ISO1600 comes out pretty well, and for landscape photos you can even go further, and all this with kit lenses.  I also managed to get hold of an old Pentax K55 manual 55mm lens over 15+ years old and it works perfectly with the body.  The advantage of the in-body image stabilization meaning that it works even for old lenses!!! This lens is much faster (f 2.0) and this means i can now take photos with no flash even under poor light, the only problem being the lack of a wide angle.  This also means i definitely will be getting myself a faster lens possibly with a macro capability.The focusing of the camera is pretty good, but under low light you will have to switch to manual mode as the auto mode tends to struggle a wee bit (compared to a D90 i tried out recently).  The lack of the AF points on the viewfinder is a bit of a bummer, though you can get away using center AF in most cases, but it does mean that if you want to take very precise control this is problem (you can use live view mode to do this, but live view as in the case of most new DSLR is rather slow).The HD video is very good, as the low light capabilities of the camera sensor definitely becoming an asset.  The Panasonic ZS3 i have is considered one of the best point and shoot for video, and comparing the video from the K-x is a bit grainy but a lot sharper and detailed.  However the audio quality is very poor compared to the ZS3.  One thing i would have loved pentax to do better is to use a different codec for the video, as the current codec is very inefficient and you have MASSIVE video files even for short recordings.I must also not forget that the camera has loads of features for effects, and the HDR capability (which i have not used much to date).  While some may not be happy with the AA batteries, the fact that AA batteries can be purchased easily is a boon if you forget your spare batteries or loose them.  However the AA batteries definitely add a substantial weight to the camera, though using lithium AA batteries reduces the bulk (however these batteries are costly so i use the trust sanyo enelopes).  Would be great if pentax can make the battery door a bit more sturdy, as it tends to jiggle around a bit.In case you want to check out some photos i have taken using this camera, check our [...] where i have uploaded some of my takes. </p>

 <p> I got this as my first DSLR.  I'm really happy.  The pics are great and I have a picky eye.  It shoots great in low light without a flash.  If you are used to point and shoot, keep in mind this camera mainly works by looking through the viewfinder, unlike most point and shoot types.  It has "live view", but it's rather slow to focus and sucks batteries fast.The flash is oddly powerful for it's size.  I have shot some volleyball action at 30ft and had it come out decent!!  In flash fill outside, the flash takes some tweaking to get used to and get right.  My old Nikon 6006 film camera's flash fill was just pop up and go.  You got great results.  With K-x flash fill, you need to make sure you are in the correct range for it to come out right.The lenses are good for the money.  Are there better? Sure, but you'll pay the same amount for one of those good lenses as this camera kit.The software that comes with the camera is good, but does take a little work to get used to. </p>

 <p> This is a good camera.  For the price it is tough to beat.  My family purchased it for my mother for Christmas with the additional 50-200mm lens and she really likes it.  It takes good photos though the lenses are not exceedingly sharp.  I own the Canon t1i and would rate that camera a 5 star but it is more expensive. </p>

 <p> Have been using Pentax products for 30+ years.  I'm learning to use the camera.  The only problem I've had so far is untrue colors when trying to photograph close-ups of flowers.  The purples and reds tend to come out with a pink cast, rather than the true red or true purple of the flower.  Photoshop helps, but I'd rather have the camera take a true picture. I'm sure this is a setting issue, I just haven't figured out which setting to change.Size, shape, and handling of the camera are great.Auto focus a little loud. </p>

 <p> This is a great camera.  I considered everything before making my purchase and have not regretted buying the K-x.  I have bought many different cameras over the years but a DSLR was just too expensive for me to consider.  Not anymore.  This K-x runs with the big boys.Google for K-x reviews and see how it compares.GREAT CAMERA! </p>

 <p> I bought this as my first digital SLR.  Prior to that I was using a Nikon L20.  Although the Nikon occasionally took nice pictures, it was dog slow.  No, it was slower than that, cause dogs aren't slow.  The K-x is definitely much faster, being very quick to focus.  I'm quite pleased with the quality of the pictures.  I've taken about 1200 pictures.  Nearly every picture is in good focus and with good detail.  I give this camera my recommendation. </p>
