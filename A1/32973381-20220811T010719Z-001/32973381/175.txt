<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> The only real problem with this piece is that it fails to draw the parallels that more recent documentaries and series have to other Megalithic civilizations of the same time period, 10,500 years BPE, and before.  Unfortunately, none of the newer documentaries reference some of the information revealed here.The two primary pieces of UFOlogy presented in this documentary are the crashed UFO, which I have seen elsewhere, and I believe is the Russian Roswell.  The film-clip they showed was only a part of what has become available, and there is more that shows the excavation of the UFO and its removal...of course, to parts unknown.  Just as the US has Dulce and it's nearly unfathomable network of connections, I'm sure Russia has the equivalent, as does China, and possibly, India.  If the object in the video is fake, it is so true to every filmed saucer image that it is amazing, and there would be no point in hoaxing to that extent.  This appears to be about the size of the Roswell crash(es), and, although larger saucers have been seen and photographed, is absolutely classic.  I photogrphed one over Denver without knowing it in 2005.  In one frame, you can see a passenger jet in its vicinity, and it appeared larger than this, but slightly smaller than the jet.The other really intriguing part was the excavation of the &#34;tomb of Osiris.&#34;  If there is still a &#34;Chamber of Knowledge&#34; beneath it, in this lifetime, at least, in Zahi Hawass', we will never see it.  Unfortunately, alternate archaeology destroys the myths and incongruities of the official Egyptian archeological lies.  The Cold War did nothing for the general dissemination of knowledge on many levels, and if only a fraction of the evidence we have now is true, we have all been mislead incredibly over the past 60-70 years.  Bits and pieces such as this come out, and several very logical scientists such as Carmen Boulter, Robert Schock, Philip Coppens, Giorgio Tsoukalos, Robert Boval, even Erich von Daniken, Jonathan Young, David Childress, and many highly competent and credentialed engineers and stone masons, as well as investigators such as Bill Birnes have ripped traditional archaeological theories to shreds.  This may be a small, but important part of an emerging truth.Just the fact that the human brain-size has tripled in less than 200,000 years, the larynx is unique in the animal world, partly due to a unique part of human DNA called VOX-something (Sorry. CRS!) and the simple opposable thumb make humans unlike any other animal, the first two attributes not seen in hominids until modern humans appeared.  Once these creatures had evolved, it would have been time to teach them...the Megalithic period.  That makes the alien mummy and the time-structure in this piece just about perfect.I do have some issues with the &#34;alien abduction&#34; segment, simply because it actually does seem as if it was at least partially staged, and some of the video shows better resolution than I believe was available to consumers in 1985.  If it is a verifiable historical event that a bus-load of people completely disappeared without signs of struggle or violence, I wouldn't be overly surprised, but I'm not completely convinced.Since I first saw the video of the crashed saucer, I have tried to find it again, and even a fragment, such as this shows is still very impressive.  It's too bad other parallels weren't drawn, but the documentary is consistent on many levels with more recent pieces and research.  There is so much that is suppressed.As an aside, Season 3 of UFO Hunters was not released in the US, but it was in Europe and elsewhere.  I had to purchase it and a region-free DVD player to watch it.  The reason it was not released here was the fact that episode 2, I believe, exposed some of what goes on at Duce, NM.  Guess what?  It was missing from the European version as well!  I finally found it on You Tube, but that gives you an idea of how far Illuminati or other powers that be will go to divert attention and subvert knowledge which might edify the average person as to the depth of what we have missed and what we are missing. </p>

 <p> Why on earth did Moore decide to take part in this special ?. -He was probably paid well, otherwise I see no reason. I have never witnessed a programme so obviously faked from start to finish. The scientists and  authors interviewed come across as being instructed what to say. (Apart  from Stanton Friedman I've never heard of any of them.) Don't believe any  of it is to be taken seriously just because some of them apparently are  russian. One of these &quot;specialists&quot; even wears a rather false  looking beard. (-They have actors in Russia too, you know !.) The footage  supposedly showing a 1968 crashed u.f.o. somewhere in the Soviet Union, and  the subsequent autopsy of a green (!) alien is in my view NOT authentic.  -This is in all likelihood someone shaking the camera about, trying to make  it look like an old piece of film. They've shot it in color, having learned  from that other infamous fake alien autopsy film (the Ray Santoni one), not  to do it in b/w. But all to no avail. A so-called film-expert claims it  could not have been made in the 80's or 90's - rubbish; it's extremely  recent. Several others naturally agree with him, even Friedman think it's  &quot;worth looking into&quot;. -Trust me, it's not. For all I know, the  &quot;secret&quot; documents shown might also be falsified; we just have no  way of knowing. Everything brought forward is treated in such a positive  manner, making it all look highly suspect. Moore circles around the same  questions time and again, only presenting them differently through-out the  90 minutes. -Way too long, the whole subject matter could've been dealt  with in 45 minutes and you wouldn't have missed a thing. Now, THAT's a  fact. Sincerely. </p>

 <p> If the show were presented in a credible documentary style it would have been fine. But for some unknown reason, the people producing these shows still insist on trying to infuse drama where it doesn't belong. It reminds me of those laughable &#34;In Search Of&#34;documentaries from the '70's where they used Leonard Nimoy to narrate so that everyone knew it was a credible investigation. </p>

 <p> I watched this and I thought - "Wow, What a great documentary about UFOs". The UFO footage of a crashed saucer did look very real and very convincing. Even if it was all a hoax the documentary interviews with Russian scientists is still very good and is a very valuable lesson for us all. However when I learned the truth this production went from being the real thing, to being a Blair Witch Project with some real elements to being very dangerous filmmaking with some questionable exploitation of real people that is borderline criminal.The filmmakers interviewed REAL Russian scientists but did not tell them that they where making this documentary. Then they re-arranged their interviews and edited them to suite their agenda. The Russian scientists believed that these people where authentic American filmmakers, but these guys where out to cheat, deceive and exploit. They even hired actors to play Russian scientists who did not exist. The books and newspaper clippings in this DVD do not exist either. Then the American filmmakers paid a bunch of local villagers peanuts to dress up as KGB agents for an advertisement they said they where making. That is the KGB UFO footage that headlines this DVD.The Russian scientists in this DVD are all over the web and have condemned this DVD to the last. It was pure exploitation through and through.Keep your bucks in your pockets. Don't support this gutter that is a sham in the fields of science, documentary filmmaking and UFOology. </p>

 <p> Like most TV documentaries of this sort, nothing is proved in the end.  But the archive footage that's show is beyond intriguing and not to be missed if you're into this sort of thing. </p>

 <p> Got to admit, this one is much better than &#34;UFO Target Earth&#34;. At leasr, it sticks to the subject at hand and you can understand it. My hangup with this sort of &#34;documentary&#34; is the lack of proof it contains. Did The Russian Armforces REALLY find the genuine article? Like &#34;The Alien Autopsy&#34;, I keep wondering about the Science....not....the Science Fiction. When I was a little kid, I loved Science Fiction movies.....&#34;War Of The Worlds&#34;.....&#34;Target Earth&#34;.....&#34;Earth Vs. The Flying Saucers&#34;. What did they find at Roswell? I would watch this &#34;documentary&#34; again, but with reservation. </p>

 <p> Roger Moore &#34;former 007 star&#34; hosts this documentary about alien encounters in Russia from the 1940's until 1989. It offers some interesting film footage and does try to be somewhat objective and critical of the information offered as facts from the KGB. A different perspective is gained by viewers from our former space race competitors of the 20 th century.  It is certainly worth watching. </p>
