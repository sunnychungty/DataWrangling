<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> I admit, the unconventional idea of allowing the fans to choose who Anna got her HEA with drew me to request this book. I wanted to see how the author set this up and handled something where both characters would have an equal chance - something that often doesn't happen in love-triangles.Unfortunately, I didn't make it more than 16% into Raw because of some pretty serious issues that are incredibly personal to me.At about 9% Anna is walking home after a long night at her new restaurant; she's tired, but alert (supposedly) when she's suddenly grabbed and pulled into an alley and ... saved from being raped by a strong rescuer. Here's my first problem - why do authors feel the need to use rape and near-rape as a plot or character point? It's traumatizing, defeating, and can be so incredibly hard to come back from. Even a rape that you're saved from can have some devastating effects on a person. This portion of the series is only 80 pages, so I didn't have a lot of hope that her recovery from this traumatic experience would be at all realistic, but I pushed on.So, Grayson turns out to be her rescuer and scares off the would-be rapist. Grayson then offers to walk her the rest of the way home...her response?&#34;On, that's not necessary.&#34;Really? Not necessary? I don't care if it's just across the street, or down the block, or you're right outside your front door (in fact that all kind of makes it worse). This is independence to the point of idiocy. But fine. I keep going.Next, Grayson mentions that they should file a report...&#34;I think that'll be a waste of time...Look, I do kind of get it, but c'mon! I'm sure as Grayson was fighting him (especially as he's an FBI agent based on the book blurb) he got a decent look at him. It's just a good idea to file a report - it will likely never lead to anything (as most of them don't), it's still something that should be done. But okay, moving on...Anna finally relents and lets Grayson walk her up to her apartment, and he starts crowding her space, and she starts getting turned on, disappointed when he doesn't kiss her. Look, I also get the whole reaffirmation of something that feels good, I get that not everyone reacts in a horrible way to such an attack, but it's now like it NEVER HAPPENED. In which case I'm left wondering why the hell was it included in the first place?If this stuff isn't a hot-button issue for you, I freely admit it is for me, then the writing is good and I do think that the story has potential. I can't get past this though.I quit. </p>

 <p> I received a copy o this book from the publisher via NetGalley.This is a short novella (eighty pages) where the heroine is caught between two men, and we, the readers get to vote on who we believe she should end up with. I've has this book for a while, but I heard there was a cliffhanger, so I was waiting for the next book, Risky to come out last month.Anna has a successful restaurant in NYC, but her success has come with a price. Anna doesn't have much of a personal life outside of work, but when her new prep chef Grayson joins her team, there's an instant connection. After getting attacked one night, Gray is there to save the day. A lot of hot lovin' happens between Anna and Gray; but Grayson has a secret. He's really an FBI agent trying to find out who's behind a drug ring going on in Anna's restaurant.Gray knows Anna is innocent, and he'll do anything to protect her, but when Anna finds out who Grayson really is she's beyond hurt and upset. Anna flees to Aruba where she meets Joaquin. Still realing from Gray's betrayal, she becomes involved with Joaquin fairly quickly. Unbeknown to her Joaquin is Gray's arch nemesis.This was a good read, and I was surprised by how much plot was in this novella, but I didn't feel connected to Anna. She's supposed to be in love with Grayson, but when she finds out who he is she runs away. I'd expect that in one of my NA novels, but it didn't fit her character to leave her restaurant in order to work out her issues with Gray. Also, I found it hard to believe that she jumps in bed so quickly with Joaquin either. As a reader, being able to choose who she ends up with is an interesting concept, and I want to know which man is chosen; but I don't think I'm invested enough to vote. </p>

 <p> In Raw (Torn Between Two Lovers #1) by Jo Davis, Anna is living her dream. She has worked hard and now is the owner of a prestigious restaurant. All is going well on the business front, but Anna is lonely. She has been so busy focusing on business that she's neglected her personal life.Things are about to get much, much hotter for Anna though when she finds herself very attracted to Gray, the new prep cook at her restaurant. Gray is just as attracted to Anna...and for more than one reason. Unknown to Anna, Gray is not at all who he appears to be. Gray is an FBI agent working undercover on a drug ring operation that seems to involve people working in Anna's restaurant. Gray does not expect to fall for Anna, and he is not comfortable leading a double life. Gray is trying to do the right thing, working for what he believes in, but his deception can't last forever.Anna and Gray really work well together, they have a lot of fun, and the sex is amazing! Anna finds herself falling deeper and deeper for Gray...will she be able to handle the truth or will it drive her away from Gray's arms and into someone elses?I loved both of these people for most of the novella. Gray is a stand up for what's right kind of guy, protective, caring, and definitely all male! He doesn't like not being completely honest with Anna, but he is hopeful that the positives can out weigh the negatives when she finds out. Anna is a hard working, independent woman who up until she gets together with Gray has been pretty single minded in her focus on life. Gray helps her see that there is a lot more to life than work. Can Anna handle the truth though? Or do actions speak louder than words? Her reaction to the unexpected turn of events between her and Gray was not how I envisioned a woman in love acting...This is the first in a three part series of novella's, so I was expecting a cliffhanger and was not disappointed. However, I do feel that the novella ends well and that Jo has started the Torn Between Two Lovers series with a bang, setting us up well for Risky, book #2.I don't want to give too much away, but with Raw by Jo Davis you are in for a sexy adventure with Anna and Gray!Recommended for any romance reader looking for some passion, mystery, and secrets </p>

 <p> RAW is a novella that features Anna Claire a restaurant owner in NYC. Anna works all the time and has very little left for personal relationships. She finds herself attracted to her sous-chef Grayson James.  Things become hot and heavy between Anna and Gray pretty quickly. Together they generate some pretty good heat.I really liked Gray, I could totally understand why he needed go undercover at Anna's restaurant. As he gets closer to her he realizes that she has nothing to do with his case and soon starts to fall for her. I felt Gray is a good guy who is trying to do the right thing by going after the criminals. Unfortunately his love life gets caught in the cross-hairs. Gray still wants to be with Anna even though she found out that he lied to her. He vows to go after her and get her back.Anna Claire's character didn't really do much for me. I think my biggest issue with her is that she jumps from one guy to the next. She has been seeing Gray until she finds out that he lied to her. She is devastated by this and has to leave town to think about what she is going to do.  While she is away in Aruba she runs into Joaquin Delacruz. From the brief meeting we have of them she appears to hook up with him pretty quickly. What bothers me is that if she was starting to fall in love with Gray how can she just get together with Joaquin. I think the story would have made more sense if both Gray and Joaquin were pursuing her at the same time.The author has decided that the readers will have the chance to pick which guy Anna chooses to be with. I think this is an interesting concept, I don't know how it will work. I foresee some people being very happy while other people being very upset, depending on who they voted for. With that being said...I thought the book was just...ok. I have read many other books of the author and this one didn't get my attention as much as the other stories. But I firmly believe that if the book sounds interesting to you than you should pick it up because your opinion could be different than mine.Jenn illhaveanotherbookDOTcom </p>

 <p> Raw is the first book in the Torn Between to Lovers series. This quick read is loaded with intrigue, romance and hot sex. There's an added element to this story that author Jo Davis has added that I find quite refresh - the reader gets to vote on which guy (TeamGrayson or TeamJoaquin) Anna gets to keep. For the unique opportunity to help choice the final hero, I would recommend reading this series.My vote on Anna is still iffy on if I like her character. For such a smart woman, running her own restaurant, toast of the town, she seemed too clueless about all the shenanigans going on under her very nose. I prefer my leading female characters to be a bit more intelligent than that. Of course, no story that has an undercover agent would be complete without some intrigue, which is excellently provided by one uber sexy Grayson James, FBI agent, posing as a lowly prep chef in her kitchen. The thought alone sends me into giggles until I think how yummy him and Anna were together. I did think their relationship progressed fast but I guess since this is a quick read at 80 pages that was to be expected. Personally, absolute favorite part of the book was the introduction of Sterling. I won't elaborate so I don't spoil it but can I just say a big AWWWW!Since this is a trilogy, there is most obviously a cliffhanger but instead of it being `wait to see what happens next' scenario the author has put a new spin on it. Instead of the author deciding who Anna chooses, choice that will be determined by reader votes. That is unique concept for a romance book and notches this review up a star just for adding that little twist. Most obviously, book #1 in the Torn Between Two Lovers series is about Anna with Gray. I'm going to go out on a limb and say book #2 will be Anna with Joaquin. I'm very curious to see how this series will end and plan on voting myself...that is after I read the next book.I received this book from JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review. The opinions and rating of this review are solely mine and in no way was I compensated.Stars - 4 Flames - 3 </p>

 <p> Raw is about Anna Claire leaving her dream by owning a high-end New York restaurant named Floor Fifty-Five. Even though she is leaving her dream, Anna is lonely.  Anna has been devoting all her time in her restaurant the past the two years making her restaurant successful.What Anna did not expect was a stupid or confident new prep chef by the name of Grayson James. Grayson was highly recommended from Le Cordon Bleu, even though he was a little older than a normal prep chef was. Greyson was a sexy muscular man with expressive blue eyes and Anna was shocked to find Grayson flirting with her."Besides your beauty, you're smart, successful. Kind. I think you need to unwind a lot, and I want to help you do that."Grayson has secret, he is not seek a career in culinary because he already has one. He is an undercover FBI agent-investigating drug smuggling operation at Floor Fifty-Five. The suspected drug gang is the Delacruz brothers, crooked casino owners. Could Anna's success be from the drugs or the exquisite food served at Floor Fifty-Five? Grayson must get close to Anna and find out if she knows anything or if she is involved too. Could getting close `blow' his cover or shatter his heart?With everything occurring in her life, Anna decides to take much needed vacation to Aruba. What she did not plan was meeting Joaquin, a billionaire entrepreneur. Anna finds herself having feeling for both Grayson and Joaquin, who will she pick?Author Jo Davis' romance novel, Raw, has done an AMAZING job writing a story capturing your attention immediately and find yourself unable to put the book down. You will also experience a roller coaster of emotions from feeling DISTRUST, SUSPENSE, and LOVE.I rate Jo Davis' novel in the Torn Between Two Lovers series, Raw - 5 AMAZING STARS! </p>

 <p> NUMBER OF STARS: 3 1/2REVIEW:In RAW we get to me Anna Claire, successful restaurant owner, confident woman, yet lonely. So when her newest prep chef catches her eye and then saves her from a mugging she decided to give Grayson a chance. Gray & Anna start to get close very fast. So fast Anna believes she is falling in love. But as they get closer Gray starts acting weird and Anne is getting a little nervous that he may be keeping something from her. But what will Anna do when she learns the truth?This is an interesting concept that Jo Davis is doing. RAW is the first in a trilogy were you as the reader pick the outcome of the series. So once you have read RAW you need to read RISKY (out in November) and decided which male you think that Anna should pick. Then in Feb 2014 Jo will be releasing the final novella in the trilogy REWARD.Disclaimer:I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.

 <p> I don't know how many times I've read a contemporary romance and wished the heroine chose the bad boy rather then the hero, which makes the concept of Raw the first instalment in Jo Davis's Torn Between Two Lovers series very appealing to me. This time the reader gets to choose who wins the heroine's heart by way of a public vote, will it be good guy FBI agent Grayson James or bad boy crime lord going legitimate Joaquin Delacruz? I love a bad boy so I think I know how I'm voting already!Anna Claire is a successful restaurateur in New York, unknown to her some of her employees are involved in drugs trafficking and using her beloved restaurant as a front. FBI agent Grayson James is working undercover in Anna's kitchen to rule out Anna from his investigation he has to get closer to her but never imagined that along the way he would fall for the driven but lonely restaurateur. When Anna discovers his deception she's devastated by his betrayal and flees New York leaving Grayson wondering if he's lost the woman he loves forever. Raw ends with Anna sunning herself in Aruba chatting away with the very smexy bad boy Joaquin who just happens to be the drugs lord Grayson has been trying to catch as part of his investigation.As a novella Raw was a pretty short read which meant Anna and Grayson's romance developed a bit too quickly for me. I couldn't help but feel Anna's devastation when she realises the man she's had in her bed has been lying to her all along, that she's been a means to an end for Grayson who is determined to send drugs lord Joaquin down. Grayson's not all bad, he sees that Anna is innocent and is determined to prove it and rule her out of his investigation knowing that when she finds out he's not the lowly prep chef his chances of forgiveness are low.With only a tiny little glimpse of bad boy Joaquin I'm already intrigued, unlike Grayson he's been upfront with Anna telling her he wants to go legitimate and that gets him bonus points in my book. So, I'm very much looking forward to more of Joaquin in the second instalment Risky out on the 19th of November and then it will be up to the readers to decide who Anna eventually chooses. I think I'm ready to vote now! </p>

 <p> Our Review, by LITERAL ADDICTION's Associate Reviewer - Marta C:*Copy gifted for an honest reviewThis is a mix of contemporary romance and a little suspense . It's also quite an unusual twist on the usual trilogies available to readers, as we get to pick the ending! In this, the first installment, we meet one potential lover, but at the end of the book another suitor is introduced ready for the next book one month later. The idea is that readers will get to vote for their favorite, and their choice will determine just who the heroine will get for her happy ever after.Anna Clair is a very hard working restaurant owner who devotes little time to her personal life. Her hard work has paid off and her successful restaurant is going from strength to strength. She has recently employed a very charismatic prep chef Grayson James who awakens desires she's long ignored. One night, Anna is subjected to an attack when leaving work, and luckily Grayson is on hand to save her. It's time for Anna to seize the moment and give in to the attraction that she feels for him. Their relationship is all consuming and pretty soon Anna is falling hard for Grayson.Grayson has a secret though. He's not a chef, he's really an FBI agent who has been placed deep undercover to investigate a drug ring that appears to be based at Anna's restaurant. Grayson is beginning to see Anna as more than just a suspect, and wants nothing more than to prove her innocence. Anna discovers his deception and is left devastated and wants nothing more to do with him. Will he convince her of his love? As this book ends Anna encounters the sexy and enigmatic Joaquin and the question is, has Grayson lost what he most wants?This is a delight to read. It's a book chock full of passion and intrigue. The reader gets action both in and out of the bedroom, and while it clearly has a cliffhanger ending, its not so annoying that the reader is left screaming at the final page. Ms. Davis has very cleverly chosen to release the follow up, Risky, just one month after publication of this.So are you Team Grayson or Team Joaquin?*I wanted to give the book more skulls, but this is just one of those books where I didn't connect with the main character. I found myself not really liking Anna, and that deducted a few points for me, personally. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> Jo Davis had a brilliant idea, create a world where the heroine will meet and fall hard for two different heroes and let the readers decide who she will end up. Once readers have voted and the hero has been decided, Ms. Davis will then finish their story in the third novella. Brilliant, right?Raw, is the first novella set in the Torn Between Two Lovers world. It introduces us to the heroine, Anna Claire, and the first of her two potential HEAs, Grayson James.Gray is a FBI agent who is working undercover at Anna's restaurant. Drugs are being dealt out of the restaurant and Gray needs to find out who's involved and just how deep the operation goes. Most importantly, he must figure out if the woman he has fallen for is aware of what is going on or if it's happening right under her nose. He will do whatever he has to to get to the truth, even if that means manipulating moments to get closer to Anna. When it is all said and done will Anna be able to trust Gray or write off their little affair?While I loved the premise of the Torn Between Two Lovers trilogy and liked the characters, I didn't feel there was much substance. Maybe it's because it is in novella format and certain things needed to be more fleshed out for me. Regardless, I enjoyed reading Raw and definitely plan on reading Risky, the second novella, so I can decide who I think should win Anna's heart. As of right now, Joaquin, the billionaire bad boy has his work cut out for him cause Gray is super smexy.*eARC PROVIDED BY PENGUIN GROUP VIA NETGALLEY* </p>

 <p> 3.5 Stars~Reviewed by ANGELA & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogA very unconventional type of read, but this novella is not set in stone. Readers have a say on whom the heroine will end up with. It's a new concept for me , but it definitely sound like fun. Joe Davis' Raw has a very intriguing story line complete with likable characters and steamy scenes. But it's not the best I've read from her. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Raw except for a couple of aspects to the story fell short for me.First, Sloane and Anna's relationship was a bit too fast for my liking. Though I know this is a novella, sometimes, I just expect more when it comes to the ?love? part of the relationship. To me, it is more believable and easier to accept that they sleep together right away compared to insta-love feelings because their attraction is so strong. Sloane and Anna definitely had that. And that part, I enjoyed a lot. I have to give Ms. Davis credit; she did a good job with the sexual tension between her characters and the same goes to her steamy scenes. I thought Anna And Sloane were very hot together.Second, because the series title promised ?two lovers?, I was expecting to get to know everyone in the love triangle. We did get to know Sloane and Anna , but we only get a glimpse of Joaquin towards the last part of the book, which didn't say much about him. There was a snippet at the end, but I just skimmed through it. From what I read though, Joaquin looks like he will give Sloane a run for his money. Where, Sloane was hot and determined to get his job done, Anna was never his first priority. And again, from the beginning of the snippet, I've read, Sloane seemed like he knows exactly what he wants from the beginning. No doubts, no exceptions. Joaquin wants Anna. Of course, I can't know for sure until book two comes out.Luckily, readers do not have to wait as Risky will be out November 19th, 2013.*ARC proved by publisher in exchange for an honest review </p>
