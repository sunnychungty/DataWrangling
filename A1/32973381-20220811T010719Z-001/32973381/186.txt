<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> In Mickey Rooney's 1991 autobiography, LIFE IS TOO SHORT, "Quicksand" gets all of two sentences. To paraphrase: "The less said about Quicksand the better. Making this movie was like sinking in the stuff," an overly-harsh assessment that may be due to personal issues rather than the picture's quality.Mickey's agent in the 1940s, Sam Stiefel, often lent him large sums of money at racetracks. When Stiefel eventually asked for repayment, he wouldn't tell Mickey how much was owed. Stiefel suggested that he take half of the star's earnings until his debt was erased, thus according to Mick, over time he was bilked for a few million dollars. When Rooney finally rebelled and fired Stiefel, he was legally unable to sever all ties until appearing in two Stiefel Production Co. projects. These wereTHE BIG WHEEL(1949) and QUICKSAND (1950).This one's a fine minor noir. The way Mickey's character gets embroiled in ever-deepening trouble because of $20 taken from a cash drawer is deftly scripted. Jeanne Cagney as the ladyfriend who urges Rooney further into crime is also quite good. Peter Lorre's oily amusement arcade adds to the mix. The only weaknesses are occasional predictability and a formulaic happy ending. In spite of these, "Quicksand" remains an entertaining crime drama some 60 years after its release. (Note: watch for original Mickey Mouse Club host Jimmie Dodd as Rooney's pal, Buzz.)TheMICKEY ROONEY: Forever Young 4 Movie Packcontains this film, an Andy Hardy entry, plus a Mickey R. western and the race car adventure mentioned above. </p>

 <p> Micky Rooney in a drama is neat in and of itself.  Here we have a everyday working man who needs just a small amount of money, enough for a date.  So he dips into the till, planning to repay the next morning.  But something goes wrong, as it almost always does when you dip into the till, and the guy finds himself having to do more and more wrong just to cover the previous wrong.  He has walked into quicksand and may never get out. </p>

 <p> Dan Brady, a short, dumb palooka, tells us, "I feel like I'm bein' shoved into a corner, and if I don't get out soon, it'll be too late. Maybe it's too late already!"Vera Novak, a platinum-blonde bad girl, gives us this, "It's not what you run away to; it's what you run away from."Elsewhere, Dan confides, "I had the right girl all along and I didn't know it."This just about sums up the story line in Quicksand, a B-movie noir that hits a lot of the clich&eacute;s but which is well photographed. Two things stand out, First, the movie just might have become a minor classic if it had kept to the ironic downbeat ending it was rushing toward, and if it had been better cast. The second thing is the overpowering feeling that we're watching part of the endless B-movie melodrama that Mickey Rooney's career became. Quicksand was made in 1950 and Rooney's great days were long over. He was just 30 years old. The genuinely entertaining MGM movies he made in the Thirties had faded. He had suddenly, in his mid-20's after WWII, begun to look like the kind of youthful middle-aged failure you want to avoid. His studio support had been yanked out from under him. His attempts to create a new image were going nowhere, limited by his own often self-conscious intensity and by what awful offers he was getting. Being married to and then divorced from the zaftig Ava Gardner only added to the general snickering.In Quicksand, Rooney is Dan Brady, a mechanic at Mackey Motors in Bay City, owned by the aging, sly, and morally corrupt Oren Mackey. One day Dan, who thinks of himself as a hot shot ladies man, meets Vera Novak (Jeanne Cagney), a blond waitress with icy eyes who has gold-digger finger-painted all over her. Dan scarcely notices Helen (Barbara Bates), the nice girl who has fallen for him. Dan takes a 20-dollar bill from the cash register to pay for a big night out on a date with Vera. He intends to replace the money on his payday. Then the auditors show up and Dan has to find a way to get the money quick. Things escalate as Dan takes one thickheaded action after another, digging himself in deeper, leading to armed theft and phone-cord strangulation. All the while Vera is playing him like a cheap accordion while Helen just wants to help him. Along the way Peter Lorre, as the owner of a tawdry pinball parlor on Bay City's pier who knows Vera too well, wanders into the film, adds to Dan's woes, and wanders off. At one point Lorre, now noticeably heavy, and Rooney, looking like an overwrought Andy Hardy, get into a fight with fists and a knife that is...I'll be honest...pretty darn good. The fight is brief and darkly lit, but both actors look like they were trying. Lorre, in fact, gives the best performance in the movie as a man you do not want to do business with.At each step of Dan's descent it was tough not to yell out, "You numbskull, don't do that." There's little satisfaction in watching a dumb guy too dumb to know better do dumb things. This isn't Burt Lancaster screwing up his life because of Yvonne De Carlo. Dan is a second-rater, too dense in his idea of himself as a killer with the ladies to notice he just might become a killer for real. But casting messes everything up. Jeanne Cagney is one of the most severe looking femmes fatale I've ever seen in a noir. That Vera could mesmerize even a lunk like Dan stretches the point. She was James Cagney's sister and has his eyes. Glenn Erickson once said, perhaps not too kindly, ""The moment you realize she's James Cagney's sister, she starts looking like Cody Jarrett wearing a dress..." And then there's Mickey Rooney as a noir protagonist. His deadly serious, almost staccato tough-guy line delivery is just over-the-top earnestness. The two of them make for a decidedly odd couple...not laughable, but not believable. Still, the movie has a great, gritty noir look about it. Quicksand is in the public domain. The version I have is watchable but that's about all. I've heard that Image has put out a release that looks good.If you like noirs and the price is right, you might like this one. If you like movies and the price is right, you'll certainly wind up reflecting on the long, unique and unsettling career of Mickey Rooney. As a side note, Rooney and Lorre put up a chunk of the financing for the movie. Not a penny came back. </p>

 <p> Here's an unusual film noir because it stars an actor you wouldn't think would be in a crime film: Mickey Rooney.But, like a lot of comedians, singers and other non-dramatic actors, Rooney could surprise you with his dramatic talents. He wasn't all Andy Hardy fluff.Rooney has been a fine actor in his long career and he does a good job here in this role as a man who makes one mistake after another. Those mistakes compound into a major crime and Rooney winds up in major trouble. In fact, it's pretty amazing to watch this unfold as one small crime leads to one thing after another making things worse and worse as it goes along.Jeanne Cagney is good as the typically-floozy blonde who is prevalent in so many of these film noirs. Barbara Bates is the wholesome good girl, but she really makes some stupid decisions late in the film, too. In other words, the three main characters are not evil people but they have major flaws.Overall, it's an odd film of sorts and one that starts slowly but gets better and better as the story progresses. Definitely worth a look to see Rooney play this kind of role. </p>

 <p> I caught this movie on a local Catholic channel that has a classic movie every Saturday night. I didn't know what to expect since I'm really not a big Mickey Rooney fan but I was surprised. I really liked this film! Everytime something else went sideways with Dan I was on the edge of my seat. I have a new appreciation for Mickey as an adult actor.  The black and white moodiness, characters, narration and the location (I love Santa Monica Pier) made this a pleasant Saturday evening in. Peter Lorre is creepy arcade manager, Jean Cagney plays the perfect femme fatale and Mickey Rooney is believable as any guy in a tough circumstance. </p>

 <p> Good story and acting. But the DVD of it - this black-&-white film was really washed out. It's watchable - but you will always notice the dullness of black and white contrast. A stupid way to manufacture it. I'd bet the VHS would be a much better picture quality. So, I ordered a VHS copy, which I haven't received yet. 4 stars for the movie story, acting, and enjoyed the old actors of those different times, not really all that long ago. </p>

 <p> Some critic called this film "noir in a teacup." I suppose it's accurate enough. A decent guy goes on a downward spiral because he wants to impress a dame with money. He makes a bad choice choosing her to go out with, but after that, every choice he continues to make on her behalf takes him deeper into the downward spiral. Only the love of a good woman can save him and it does. You rarely get a happy ending in noir, but this one provides it.Noir films usually get pretty ugly and evil. There's always at least one murder. But there's none in this film. Hence, it really is noir in a teacup. It upholds a certain sense of decency and niceness despite the downward moral curve Mickey Rooney's character takes.The only unbelievable aspect to this film for this viewer was how Mickey Rooney's character falls for Jeanne Cagney's character. I mean, wow, what a hard-looking, self-interested, gangster-like dame that woman is! How could a sweet car mechanic as is Rooney's character fall for such a mannish woman?Barbara Bates plays the true romance role, and she does a great job of it in this film while also remaining really easy on the eyes. </p>

 <p> Passport Video presents "THE ULTIMATE FILM NOIR" (1945-1953), --- (Dolby digitally remastered) --- ten tantalizing tales of Film Noir on five suspenseful discs --- featuring top performances from the '40s and '50s with outstanding drama and screenplays, along with a wonderful cast and supporting actors to bring it all together ... another winner from the vaults of Film Noir Hollywood gems.Film noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe Hollywood crime dramas that set their protagonists in a world perceived as inherently corrupt and unsympathetic...Hollywood's classic film noir period is generally regarded as stretching from the early 1940s to the late 1950s...Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography, while many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Depression...the term film noir (French for "black film"), first applied to Hollywood movies by French critic Nino Frank in 1946, was unknown to most of the American filmmakers and actors while they were creating the classic film noirs..the canon of film noir was defined in retrospect by film historians and critics; many of those involved in the making of film noir later professed to be unaware at the time of having created a distinctive type of film.Five-disc collector's set includes "SCARLET STREET" (1945) (95 mins/Universal Pictures), featuring Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett, Dan Duryea and Margaret Lindsay --- "DETOUR" (1945) (67 mins/PRC), featuring Tom Neal, Ann Savage, Claudia Drake and Edmund MacDonald --- "THE STRANGE LOVE OF MARTHA IVERS" (1946) (117 mins/Paramount Pictures), featuring Barbara Stanwyck, Van Heflin, Kirk Douglas, Lizabeth Scott and Judith Anderson --- "WHISTLE STOP" (1946) (85 mins/United Artists) featuring George Raft, Ava Gardner, Victor McLaglen, Tom Conway and Jorja Curtright --- "HE WALKED BY NIGHT" (1948) (80 mins/Eagle-Lion), featuring Richard Basehart, Scott Brady, Jack Webb, Roy Roberts, Whit Bissell and James B. Cardwll --- "TRAPPED" (1949) (78 mins/Bryan Foy Productions / Eagle-Lion), featuring Lloyd Bridges, Barbara Payton, John Hoyt, Russ Conway and James Todd --- "IMPACT" (1949) (83 mins/United Artists), featuring Brian Donlevy, Ella Raines, Charles Coburn and Helen Walker --- "D.O.A." (1950) (83 mins/United Artists), featuring Edmond O'Brien, Pamela Britton, Luther Adler and Beverly Campbell --- "QUICKSAND" (1950) (79 mins/Samuel Steifel Productions / United Artists), featuring Mickey Rooney, Jeannie Cagney, Peter Lorre and Barbara Bates --- "THE HITCH-HIKER" (1953) (71 mins/RKO Pictures), featuring Edmond O'Brien, Frank Lovejoy and William Talman --- and the documentary "THE BEST OF FILM NOIR".Film noirs tend to revolve around heroes who are more flawed and morally questionable than the norm, often fall guys of one sort or another...the characteristic heroes of noir are described by many critics as "alienated"; in the words of Silver and Ward, "filled with existential bitterness."...certain archetypal characters appear in many film noirs--hardboiled detectives, femmes fatales, corrupt policemen, jealous husbands, intrepid claims adjusters, and down-and-out writers...as can be observed in many movies of an overtly neo-noir nature, the private eye and the femme fatale are the character types with which film noir has come to be most identified, but a minority of movies now regarded as classic noir feature either...crime, usually murder, is an element of almost all film noirs; in addition to standard-issue greed, jealousy is frequently the criminal motivation...a crime investigation--by a private eye, a police detective (sometimes acting alone), or a concerned amateur--is the most prevalent, but far from dominant, basic plot...in other common plots the protagonists are implicated in heists or con games, or in murderous conspiracies often involving adulterous affairs...false suspicions and accusations of crime are frequent plot elements, as are betrayals and double-crosses...amnesia is far more common in film noir than in real life, and cigarette smoking can seem virtually mandatory.This collection of "The Ultimate Film Noir" (1945-1953) --- still has the magic that we remember from those bygone years --- but as long as we have the labels and networks who play and show these wonderful films of yesteryear, they will never be forgotten --- plus the Bonus of Best of Film Noir on the final disc --- and a great job by Passport Video for this release --- looking forward to more of the same from the '40s and '50s vintage...order your copy now from Amazon or Passport Video, stay tuned once again for more remarkable films from the vaults of classic television and Hollywood during the Golden Era of Film Noir --- All My Heroes have been Gumshoe Detectives!Total Time: 909 mins on DVD ~ Passport Video #5480 ~ (5/02/2006) </p>

 <p> Andy. But now he's an older, wiser, cynical vet with a chip on his shoulder. His weakness, of course is still women & they love him (?). He "borrows"  $20 from the till at work to show his date a good time & plans to return the money the next day. But things go badly awry from there as he get sucked deeper & deeper into crime. Robbery, armedrobbery, burglary & attempted murder & all for a woman who is using him to get a mink coat. The other woman in his life, the one who really loves him then steps in to help him. A good little noir from 1950 I might not have known about except it is on the classic film noir dvd. </p>

 <p> "Quicksand" is a film noir piece about a guy named Dan whose problem starts when he "borrows" $20 from the cash register at the garage where he works to take out a girl.  Mickey Rooney does a good job playing it straight as a young guy who makes one wrong decision that leads to the next, etc.  In the opening scene in a diner, he establishes a very natural delivery with dialogue, although we never get too deep emotionally.  There are no burning seething reactions which could have deepened the film's impact.  Perhaps that was director Irving Pichel's call.Jimmy Cagney's sister Jeanne Cagney steals the movie for me as Vera, the bad girl.  Early on, Vera sets her eyes on a mink coat, out of reach for a woman who works as a cashier in a diner.  She smokes; she smooches and vamps her way through the part giving a great film noir femme fatal performance as the quintessential bad girl.  The best moment in the film is her final parting with Dan who realizes she has betrayed him and hurls an insult as he heads for the door.  She has one quick reaction like, "No big deal."  It's priceless.  However, perhaps as it is intended for the character, we feel no depth with the character, no intense emotional world, which makes the film entertain, but not grab you.Barbara Bates plays Helen, the girl next door who loves Dan no matter how badly he treats her.  It's again hard to tell why she loves the guy so much, other than the script says she does.  She moons over him, almost stalks him it seems, and maintains a sunny attitude despite constant inconsiderate treatment.  While the actress in real life would later commit suicide by carbon monoxide in a garage, here she maintains the sunny superficial one-note performance.Art Smith who plays Mackey does a nice job.  In Smith's bio, it states that he was part of the legendary Group Theatre and was blacklisted in Hollywood during the McCarthy era after being turned in by Elia Kazan.  While his career would go on hiatus about 1952, here he turns in an understated but excellent job as the garage owner who also seeks to gouge cash out of Dan.  There is one quick scene between Mackey and Dan making an arrangement for a late-night payoff that is brilliant.  It's brief, but the eye contact is direct, the emotions are clear and the characters play off each other well.I confess that I did find it frustrating to see Dan make so many successively bad decisions.  The now vintage cars and the pier sets all gave a great flavor to the film.  Peter Lorre gives a strong performance as the creep Nick who also contributes to Dan's problems.  This is a film that is interesting to revisit or discover if you haven't seen it before, but does not quite rise to the level of a classic in the genre.  Enjoy! </p>

 <p> The opening credits roll over stock footage of waves crashing on the shore.  Huh?  Doesn't everybody know the visual that goes with "quicksand" is that hand grasping at air as it sinks into the ooze?  Never mind, we get it:  someone is about to go under and that someone is auto mechanic Danny(Mickey Rooney).  Danny is having lunch at the greasy spoon with his buds from Mackay's Garage when in strolls hot mama Vera(tougher than nails Jeanne Cagney).  It's mid-day and Vera is wearing a cocktail dress, lots of after dark jewelry, and toting an evening purse.  Yep, Vera didn't go home the night before.  She's a bad girl and Danny's kind of woman.  Danny gets her to accept a date with him then realizes he hasn't any money.  Unable to borrow, he pilfers a twenty out of the cash register at Mackay's.  A friend is repaying a loan the next morning and the garage's accountant won't be showing up for several days so everything's going to be OK, right?  Nope.  Nothing is ever OK in the world of noir.  Danny's date with Vera is a success.  They end up smoking cigarettes on the beach and we know what that's the visual for.  The next morning Danny's friend stiffs him on the loan and the accountant shows up days ahead of schedule.  Danny goes to a jewelry store, buys an expensive watch on time, hocks the watch , and puts the twenty back in the register.  Things now go quickly out of control for Danny:  the jewelry store owner becomes suspicious Danny is going to skip without paying for the watch and demands payment in 24 hours or he'll call the police.  Danny rolls a drunk to get the money.  Vera's former boss, Nick,  finds out and blackmails Danny into stealing a car for him from Mackay's garage.  Mackay finds out Danny stold the car and tells him to pay for it the next morning or he will call the cops.  Vera knows where Nick hides a lot of cash and helps him steal it.  But Vera takes half the money and buys a fur coat.  Danny gives Mackay what's left, which is not enough.  Mackay takes the money then picks up the phone to have Danny arrested.  Danny strangles Mackay with the phone cord.  Now he's on the run with Helen(Barbara Bates) the nice girl who has always been in love with him.  They carjack a kindly elderly gentleman who happens to be a lawyer.  The lawyer tries to talk Danny into surrendering but Danny makes a last ditch attempt to hop a friend's fishing boat to Mexico.  Danny is shot and captured in the attempt.  Helen and the lawyer hear on the car radio that Mackay isn't dead after all.  Since Danny has never been in trouble before the lawyer thinks he will get only a year.  Danny accepts this, glad that it's all over.  Helen says she will wait for him.The plot's pretty slender and the relatively happy ending is un-noirish but the movie crackles with suspense thanks to the tight direction of Irving Pichel.  Pichel also deserves kudos for taming Rooney's often out of control  energy.  No Andy Hardy mannerisms here.  Rooney gives a quiet, subtle, and thoughtful turn as the desperate Danny.  It is the best performance of Rooney's career.  Everybody's favorite creep, Peter Lorre, is superb as always as the reptilian Nick.  And look for a very young Jack Elam in the barroom scene.This movie has some clever product placement.  The very first scene is a delivery man carrying a case of Coke into the greasy spoon.  Cases of Coke are also seen in the barroom.  Maytag appliances are seen in the window of a hardware store.  A clock in Mackay's Garage with Helbros advertising is seen several times.  And most fun of all:  an upside down box of Bit-O-Honey candy is next to the cash register in the luncheonette.The audio and visual quality of the DVD is just so so but the movie looks like it was done on a real shoestring.  It was probably like that from the beginning and not a bad pressing. </p>

 <p> "Quicksand" is a little film noir that runs only 1 hour and 19 minutes. It lacks clever dialogue and complex characterization but goes right for the working class audience with a cast of ordinary folk. Dan Brady (Mickey Rooney) is a regular guy, an auto mechanic and WWII veteran who is reluctant to get tied down to girlfriend Helen (Barbara Bates). Helen is a pretty young woman, patient to a fault, in love with Dan, and willing to put up with his rebuffs. She's the perfect companion for Dan, but Vera Novak (Jeanne Cagney), blond bombshell cashier at the local coffee shop, appeals to his ego. Dan cajoles Vera into a date but finds that he hasn't enough money to take her out on the town. So he takes $20 from the cash drawer at work, intending to replace it the next day. When he is unable to come up with the cash in time, Dan's attempts at creative financing get him deeper and deeper into trouble."Quicksand" isn't a bad film, but there isn't much to it, and what there is is repetitive. Dan is a nice guy with limited intellect and scruples who makes the same mistake repeatedly, digging himself deeper into the same nightmarish hole. He's an unimaginative sort of fool, though not inauthentic. Vera's a trashy, simple femme fatale, but a convincing threat. When Dan asks her, "Think you can handle me?" She replies, "Sure, I can handle you easy." And there is no one easier than Dan, whose aptitude for idiocy and self-pity prove a poor combination. Mickey Rooney is perfectly good in the role. Peter Lorre is wasted as the sleazy owner of a penny arcade. Maybe Lorre was gray-listed during this time. "Quicksand"'s characters are not sophisticated enough to be compelling, and the movie's ending lowers the film where more courageous writing might have elevated it. But "Quicksand" is effective as a sort of plebian film noir. The Image Entertainment DVD (2000) has no subtitles or bonus features. </p>

 <p> Danny (Mickey Rooney) borrows /steals $20 from his employer for a night out with a worldly woman he has just met; intending to return the money in a few days after he gets paid, before discovery; but things do not work out as planned. Danny is extorted by mean men and later by bad men into more serious crimes to stay out of jail; ever deeper into crimes.The appeal of the film is the believability of the situations Danny finds himself in. Filmed on location in Los Angeles. Peter Lorre is the bad-guy.This is not an Andy Hardy type film, but sort of a film-noir without the mystery. It is intriguing with good character-actors and realism. The film claims a happy-ending; has a good moral; but it is not a happy-ending. Thus, it is not a feel-good, film. I am a happy-ending guy; so only 3-stars.I watched it on Amazon's Video-on-demand. </p>

 <p> Mickey Rooney stars in Quicksand, a great film about how a small unnoticeable crime can turn into something large and out of control if one isn't careful. After needing money for a date with a beautiful woman in town (Jeanne Cagney), Dan turns to his cash register at the auto shop where he works for a twenty that he can easily replace later. However, when the accountant comes early to check up on the place, he's in need of cash faster than he planned, so he buys a watch on the installment plan and pawns it for the cash. When he learns this is a crime, he has to come up with $100 in a day, leading to even more problems down the line.Rooney is wonderful in the leading role of this gripping film. His innocent face does not hinder him in this serious part. His kisses are passionate and reason to support why he was such a ladies man.Although this is a bargain DVD, the picture is crisp and clear and the sound quality is good. </p>

 <p> Automobile mechanic Mickey Rooney spots killer-blonde waitress Jeanne Cagney (Jimmy's sister) working at the local diner and impulsively asks her out.  His troubles begin when she accepts.  The cash strapped Rooney lifts a $20 bill out of the till at the garage where he's employed.  The couple spend a pleasant evening window shop drooling (Jeanne) over a $2000 mink and glaring (Mickey) at ex-boyfriend, husband, or something Peter Lorre at the penny arcade he manages.  Trouble arrives the next morning in the person of the garage's accountant, who's a couple of days early and sure to spot the missing double sawbuck. Dark eyed blondes are murder in movies like QUICKSAND, and before you can say "Andy Hardy" Rooney is up to his neck and sinking fast.QUICKSAND is well crafted and, on its own terms, convincing enough.  The toughest pill it has us swallow concerns Rooney. Even if he was pushing 30 when this one was made, he still looks like a  baby-faced teenager.  You can't blame an actor for being short and young looking, but it makes it hard to believe two beautiful women are interested in him, or that Judge Hardy is letting him stay out long enough to get into all the trouble he gets into in this one. Rooney has always had a sunshine-y, puckish charisma which found no outlet in this dark tale of a life unraveling.  In other words, QUICKSAND doesn't play to his strengths.Lorre fares best and his scenes with Rooney are delightful.  Lorre never had to present his bona fides when playing an unsavory character - he oozed sleaze.  Coupling his physical assets - short stature, protruding eyes, a decadently foreign accent - with master acting abilities and nearly flawless timing Lorre consistently rose above all but the best of material, as he does so here.  I wish his role had been larger.  Best scene - while putting the squeeze on Rooney's character, Lorre is told "You must be crazy!"  Catching the beat and riding it out to the exact millisecond, Lorre lifts a hooded eyelid and says "No, I don't think so."  A pretty flat line on the page, but with Lorre's reading it's the coda to the best scene in the movie.  Did I mention it would have been nice if he'd been in more scenes?The delicately beautiful Barbara Bates plays Rooney's Good Girl ex-girlfriend. In movies like this, Good Girls are usually around just long enough to get jilted in act one. If lucky, they're allowed to throw a pair of sad puppy eye looks at the hero before disappearing.  They typically reappear in act three, ten minutes before the closing credits, with either a downy shoulder for a repentant hero to lean on or a funeral to arrange.  The Bad Girl, on the other hand, has it all going her way.  She gets the juicy act two meat, dresses better, gets her name above the title and her picture on the posters.  They're usually given a swollen scene or two to chew on and something to foam at the mouth over before the movie tosses them out.  Oh, yeah, and they gets to dress better, too.  Most of the time she's the "good" actress, while the other is the "pretty" actress - although with so little business to attend to, it's hard to tell exactly what kind of actress the Good Girl is either way.Miscast or not, Rooney is decent enough in QUICKSAND, an entertaining and unspectacular film </p>

 <p> Such a disappointment. I was loving on this snappy noir right up to the last 2 minutes. Has all the Noir elements: bad girl, good guy going wrong,  the mousy little dishrag good girl, moody black and white cinematography and the zippy dialogue. Then True Love shows up and ruins everything.Mickey Rooney stars as an auto mechanic lead into an ever escalating Life of Crime by his little head, if you know what I mean. It all starts with him lifting a $20 from the cash register at his workplace, and spirals down the slippery slope, as mentioned above. Mickey is really quite good in this as the hapless everyman who can't seem to lift a penny from the "take one, leave one" dish without getting seen. The Very Bad Vera leads him along by the short and curlies until she doesn't need him anymore, but don't worry she gets her comeuppance. Peter Lorre shows up to slither along leaving a trail of slime on everything which I love. It's all nicely sliding into Hades when the Good Dishrag saves Our Hero from his baser instincts. Now why would she want this guy anyway, knowing what kind of awful choices he makes? Any way it all sours at the end as our hero is assured that he won't do hardly any time for his crime spree. Not likely these days! San Jose police would have beaten the fecal matter out of him!Three stars for the anticipation of a great ride. The ending ruins it. </p>

 <p> This movie is better than what I thought it would be at first.  Mickey Rooney does a outstanding job in this movie.  I've been a admirer of Mickey's work for some time now.  This isn't his usual nice guy role but he plays his part very well and is very believable.  I would recommend this movie for any fan of the great Mick and for anyone who likes a good movie!  Very interesting and a cool flick! </p>

 <p> Micky Rooney was 30 years old when he made Quicksand in 1950.  His character Danny Brady is 26, but Rooney still looks eighteen. I think the picture works with Rooney as an auto mechanic who brushes off the advances of "good" girl Helen; played by a very pretty actress named Barbara Bates, and instead is seduced by "bad" girl Vera (Jeanne Cagney). Poor Danny wants to be a player but he has neither the money or the savvy to pull it off. Director Irving Pichel never lets viewers see the all-american persona that seems to embody Danny. Maybe this was done on purpose as a means to shed Rooney's Andy Hardy skin. When Danny lifts a twenty dollar bill from the register at Mackey's Auto his troubles begin.  Vera the blonde(who really isn't that good looking, her resemblance to actor brother James Cagney is striking) becomes the reason why Danny slips further and further into quicksand. With each thoughtless caper you almost wish Danny can escape.  His liason with the shrewd, dangerous Vera gives Danny just enough of a razor's edge to mark his demise into noir disillusionment. Peter Lorre gives a creepy performance as Nick, the arcade owner from Long Beach's famed waterfront called The Pike. When the sand gets too deep for Danny, this is when the picture fails to deliver.  A sugar coated, moralistic ending brings Danny back full circle to Helen his true love. This is why Quicksand is not on par with a noir classic like Crisscross.  It is another Hollywood tragedy why a beautiful actress like Barbara Bates commited suicide at age 44, 16 years after this film was made. </p>

 <p> An auto mechanic (Mickey Rooney) "borrows" $20 from the garage cash register, with every intention of replacing the money the next day, only to have fate conspire to suck him into a quicksand pit of betrayal, burglary, assault, kidnapping and car theft. Who knew you could stretch 20 bucks that far?This 1950 cautionary tale piles one consequence on top of another at a furious rate, and if the results aren't entirely credible, they're not uninteresting either. Though Rooney himself dismisses the movie as a "bomb," it's actually a fine example of the kind of solid, efficient B-level filmmaking that's pretty much disappeared from the scene. In fact, taken on its own modest terms, QUICKSAND is a minor classic of the film noir genre. </p>
