 <p> For those of you who blinked and missed Chris Carter's series HARSH REALM, here's your chance to see all the episodes. Only 3 episodes originally aired on the network, although I understand that the FX channel aired the rest the following year. I'm not sure how a show can be expected to get an audience in 3 episodes, but from my perspective HARSH REALM really wasn't given an opportunity to develop. It's premise was simple enough - a mission into a virtual reality world which was created by the military, but which of course goes awry. But the shows' character and plot complexity rivaled X-FILES and I think those of us who watched were still trying to see what it was about when the plug got pulled. This DVD is a welcome release for all who wanted to see where the story was going. Although as yet unreleased, I'm giving the Fox people 3 stars just for having the clarity to release something they once deemed as a failure, from one of televisions most innovative writer/producers. I'm sure all fans of Carter's other shows, X-FILES and MILLENNIUM, look forward to it's release. </p>

 <p> Chris Carter's Harsh Realm only lasted three episodes on television but the potential was there for much more. The series took for its premise an alternate reality inside a military videogame that existed in parallel with the real world. Into this world is recruited Thomas Hobbes (Scott Bairstow) , a soon to be discharged Army officer, sent on a final mission inside the game to kill General Omar Santiago (Terry O'Quinn) who has hijacked the game in the hopes of turning the virtual world into the real world. Along the way Hobbes joins fellow volunteers Mike Pinnochio (D.B. Sweeney) and mute healer Florence (Rachel Hayward) who join him on his mission.The series was exceptionally well designed but not well thought out. The three episodes that made it to television were enough to wet out appetites but little more. The final six episodes are of the stand alone variety which do little to explain the character arcs that Carter hoped to develop over time. One of the greatest problems with the show was that Carter did not include a powerful female lead character. Without a strong female we get a show that features stunts and explosions but not one which helps the characters to mature into individuals that the audience should care about.The episodes are a mix of really good with really bad. The plotting becomes silly in some but shows moments of greatness. It is said that if a show does not become a hit in the first few episodes Fox is likely to cancel it. This was one of those shows. With a little more time it could have developed into something special. What we have in this box set is a footnote on what might have been.The episodes are presented on three discs. The picture is full screen with Dolby 2.0 sound. The sound mix is a little bland for my tastes but suits the material. Included are two commentaries on the Pilot episode by Carter and director Dan Sackheim. The remaining special features are minimal and include a making of featurette, a feature on the logo and some TV spots.Rent it if you are interested. </p>

 <p> To be honest the pilot was rather weak, but I have seen that before.It never got a chance to mature, but even in the 9 shows that were made it improved so much. If networks would give a show time to 'gel' this could still be on TV!!If you like Charter, Wong and Morgan's writing you will like this, </p>

 <p> For those not familiar with Harsh Realm it was a short lived TV show on the Fox network produced and written by the same people who brought the show The X-Files to television.Premise : A soldier played by actor Scott Bairstow unwittingly is thrust mentally into a military game known as Harsh Realm where the object of the game is to kill the leader, General Santiago, played by Lost actor, Terry O'Quinn.However once inside the game if you die there, you die here.Like The X-Files, Harsh Realm deals with conspiracies, intrigue and the human spirit to overcome great difficulties.If you enjoy these type of shows I highly recommend this sadly short lived TV series that ran only half a season. </p>

 <p> Firefly, Dark Angel and now the Realm (Kill-FOX). The music score is really good, and the acting was far better than average. I am really impressed with the photography and characters. They Made this show great, even if it was (claimed to be inadvertently) a Matrix ripoff.They managed to do it well and keep it pretty interesting though. Surprisingly too, on a budget probably far lower than Firefly, my personal Favorite Show Ever. I'm glad to own this set. It was a really slick show, that will keep fans of X-Files, Mad-Max, Matrix and Trek, something to chew on. </p>

 <p> The premise of the show sounded interesting, so I bought the set out of curiosity, since many good shows have gotten cancelled before they could find their audience.The pilot started off well, right up to the point where they kick the poor hero into the "Harsh Realm".  From that point things went downhill in a hurry.  The Realm made no sense logically OR techno-logically. Nobody explains just why:1. They can't just unplug the computers running the simulation. The computers have to exist in the Real World, at a known location. Pull plug, game over.2. The excuse that if they shut down the sim, the players in it die doesn't hold water.  Even if the bodies are in the physical equivalent of a coma, you cut off a data stream, they wake up.Nobody dies just because the computer crashes in the middle of "Doom 3", for example.3. This "Santiago" jacks in and out at will?  And *NOBODY* else can, including the system administrators for the computers? [cue sarcastic laughter]I don't mind fantasy, but at least the background and characters should make sense.  This one didn't.  I gave up even before the pilot episode ended. </p>

 <p> There's just no excuse for this show being canceled. It was a brilliant concept that had limitless possibilities for several seasons worth of interesting story lines. Though some referred to it as the poor man's Matrix, this was really well-produced, despite being on a tv series budget. Too bad it never got the promotion from the network that it deserved. The only down-side... being left hanging at the end of the series. </p>

 <p> With Harsh Realm, Chris Carter tried to hit off his third television show after "The X-Files" and "MillenniuM" back in 1999. For reasons that were never really explained, the Fox network cancelled the show after only 3 (in words: THREE!!!) aired episodes, because ratings did not seem to be what they had expected (after three episodes, please keep in mind!). So, although nine episodes had been produced, only three had been aired. Of course, this DVD-set contains all the nine produced episodes.In short, this is what the show is about: Lt.Thomas Hobbes, portrayed by Scott Bairstow, returns from military duty in Sarajevo after rescuing his friend Waters there, asking himself what exactly guides his life. He now lives on a military base with his beautiful fianc&eacute; Sophie, played by Samantha Mathis, only to be called to a secret meeting in the middle of the night. There he is told by a general, played by Lance Henriksen, that there actually is a virtual computer simulation created by the US government, which had the purpose of serving as an almost perfect virtual environment for training soldiers and had been obtained through scanning of the real world, so that, in a sense, a true parallel world exists: Harsh Realm, a synthetic world filled with virtual characters in the image of real people in the real world. The problem is that a certain Omar Santiago, played by Terry O'Quinn, has entered Harsh Realm, basically conquered it and now rules part of it as a Hitler-esque General in his very own city complex, Santiago City. This city is shielded from the rest of the realm, so that the people inside can live by his cruel rule of intellectual suppression, yet in material richness and pompous lifestyle, while the world outside is a Mad Max-like postwar wasteland, parts of which Santiago tries to conquer to expand his empire. After several soldiers had been sent into the realm to assassinate Santiago but did not succeed, Hobbes is the next one to be sent, and so he enters the realm. Here he meets another hard-ass soldier, whom he finally finds to be an ally: Mike Pinnochio, played by D.B.Sweeney. He also meets his old friend Waters, played by Max Martini, whom he had saved in Sarajevo, only to find out that he is now Santiago's right hand and husband of his fianc&eacute; Sophie, who does not recognize him, and who, in the real world, is told that Hobbes has been killed in action. There also is the mysterious character of Florence, portraied by Rachel Hayward, who is mute, but who can heal a wound inflicted on Hobbes with her bare hands. Where does she get that power from within this game? In the end, Hobbes must accept and deal with his new situation, try to survive, to kill the tyrant Santiago and somehow get back to Sophie or at least to let her know he is still alive. This brings the character Inga Fossa, played by Sarah-Jane Redmont, into action, a mysterious double-agent working for Santiago, but also aiding Hobbes. Also, she knows how to cross between the real world and the realm, so that she is Hobbes' only possibility to reach Sophie outside. To make the drama perfect, in the final shot of the pilot it is revealed that not only Hobbes and some other "real people" exist along the virtual characters in the realm whilst their wired bodies are lying in a secret facility in the real world, but literally thousands of them.....This plot marked the beginning of an incredible show, which had a greater impact on me with just it's first, and sadly last, nine episodes than any other first nine episodes of any other show ever. The X-Files/Mad Max/military feel is just perfect and gives the whole thing a wonderful post-apocaliptic, pessimistic, yet adventurous and thriller-like feeling, paired with a truly wonderful cast and crew, who supply superb work on par with other Carter productions, right down to the writers and to Mark Snow, again the brilliant composer that he always was. The drama is intense and lets you really dive in and feel with the characters, so that even within the small number of episodes a true bond is created between the characters and the audience, just like it should be. Several mysteries are begun to be explored, but sadly, as said before, the show was surprisingly cancelled, so most of them, as well as the premise of the show, are never solved or explained.All in all, it is completely idiotic and not at all understandable why this show was cancelled, at least not in my opinion, and also not in Mr Carter's, I guess. But that sadly is what happened, at least in the real world, and is therefore something the fans of the show and of Carter's work have to live with. It is a small miracle that this show ever made it onto DVD, so please do not hesitate to buy and experience it. You will not be disappointed, believe me! Maybe the Fox network will finally realize that this unprecedentedly premature cancellation was a mistake after all! </p>

 <p> Harsh Realm, created by X-Files and Milennium creator Chris Carter, was just one of many prime time sci-fi dramas that died a quick death on Fox.  Three episodes were aired when it originally premiered in 1999, with the other six episodes aired on Fox's FX cable network the following year.  The sad part about Harsh Realm, is that there was plenty of promise and potential, but none of it ever got to get off the ground thanks to yet another brilliant idea from the bigwigs at Fox.  The story revolves around Army Lieutenant Tom Hobbes (Scott Bairstow), called back into action to supposedly test run a virtual reality war game called Harsh Realm.  He becomes trapped inside, with hundreds of others who identify him as the "savior" they have been awaiting.  Plenty of comparisons to the Matrix (which was released earlier that year) could be a turn off to some, but Harsh Realm was never given the chance to take off like it could have.  The rest of the cast includes D.B Sweeney as a fellow trapped soldier, Milennium alumnus Terry O'Quinn as deranged Harsh Realm dictator Santiago, and Samantha Mathis as Tom's estranged fiance.  Now that Harsh Realm is on DVD, it's worth checking out, and we can thank Fox once again for squandering good potential (Firefly anyone?). </p>

 <p> The biggest knock against this show is that it came to light right as the axe was given to Millennium,  essentially replacing a show just finding finding it's audience and niche. I watched the pilot of HARSH REALM and it didn't click with me.  Now that I am reliving Mllnnm season 1, I am willing to give this show another shot for C. Carters sake.  Not all of these episodes were aired, maybe the show has something to it in the end, maybe not either way my purchase should help ensure that FOX releases Millennium season 2 and 3 on DVD in the States. </p>

 <p> X-Files and Millennium fans will immediately recognize the landscape in Carters third series, Harsh Realm.  Basically the series is about a soldier who has to go into a virtual reality game to assassinate this legendary general, Omar Santiago, who has taken it over and plans to end the real world in order that his virtual reality world may be all that survives.  At least, that seems to be the gist.  As is probably already obvious to those who bought this set, the series lasted for only nine episodes, three of which only got to be aired.  The first question I asked myself, of course, was why this series tanked.  In the featurette interviews with Carter and producers, it was pointed out that Harsh Realm debuted just after The Matrix had hit the theaters.  Maybe the viewing public had had enough of virtual realities for awhile.  For myself, I just wasn't won over by the lead actors.  Scott Bairstow was just too young and unconvincing as Thomas Hobbs (a reference to the celebrated 17th century philosopher-and the nasty, brutish and short-lived nature of Harsh Realm), who along with Samantha Mathis, who played his fianc&eacute;, could've come straight from the college dorms.  Tipping the scales, however, we also have D.B. Sweeney playing a cynical soldier named Pinocchio, who has no wish to return to his disfigured self in the real world, and Terry O'Quinn, whom viewers will remember from the Millennium series, who plays the villain, Omar Santiago.  Aside from the casting, the production and set designs are first-class.  The stories run from mediocre to above standard.  My two personal favorites were, "Kein Ausgang", which is an awesome tribute to the legendary "Twilight Zone" show, the "Three Percenters", which is a pretty decent science fiction story, and "Cincinatti", which is about as intense as anything on TV for the first 35 minutes (Quinn's stand-out performance is essential for this episode's relative success), but then shoots itself in the foot at the end with a very trite ending-which ironically is probably what happened to the series in real life, as both viewers (and maybe the network investors) just probably weren't in the mood for the hook and play style that had been used so successfully in the X-Files. </p>

 <p> I watched this show when it first came out on Fox, and then the "unaired" episodes on FX. It's a great concept with all the familiar Chris Carter conspiracy elements, so I would recommend it to X-Files fans. And Lost fans who want to see Terry O'Quinn before he showed up on that island should check it out, too. There were a few very good episodes, particularly "Kein Ausgang", which never aired on Fox. But, unfortunately, there were also several weak episodes, far too high a percentage for such a short series. Maybe the show didn't really get the chance to get off the ground, but I'm also not sure it was a sustainable concept.The transfers look great, and I'm very pleased that they are in widescreen even though the box says different. The special features are minimal. Chris Carter does what seems like a less-than-enthusiastic commentary on the Pilot. There's also a second, more interesting commentary track by director Daniel Sackheim. And there are a few fluff-piece featurettes on the last disc. And that's about it.Summing up, I'd say this is a must-buy for Chris Carter completists, but probably not for anyone else. It's worth checking out, but not likely to land on too many lists of all-time favorites. </p>

 <p> Chris Carter's third show was never allowed to develop from its short appearance due to a miserable marketing campaign on the part of the Fox network. I am a fan of Chris Carter's work, and had been eagerly awaiting the premiere of this show. Surprisingly, I had a difficult time trying to find out when the show would be premiering, since Fox was not promoting it. By accident, I tuned in on the night of the series premiere, and caught the tail end of the prologue. Fox claims that the numbers weren't there for the premiere, and cancelled the show after just three episodes. It's unrealistic to think that viewers would tune in when there's no advertisement for the show. As such Harsh Realm suffered from the harsh realities of marketing gone wrong.I think Harsh Realm had another thing going against it: it was the replacement of Chris Carter's second series Millennium, which had started to develop a loyal fan base. Millennium was and still is a remarkable show, and I believe a lot of the fans, including myself, expected an equally remarkable show as a successor. So, at the beginning, Harsh Realm had big shoes to fill.The series pilot was not the best of Chris Carter's work (except for the final scene of the episode, when the viewer realizes how widespread the problem is), though the story had only just started. The two subsequent episodes continued to reveal the plot that was introduced in the pilot. Only after the third episode &quot;Inga Fossa&quot; is there enough told to proceed to the first stand-alone episode. Unfortunately, until the FX cable network debuted these episodes a year later did anyone get the chance to see the remaining 6 episodes of the series.I have seen some of the remaining six episodes that aired later on FX. They are very good in production quality, and the plot device of a virtual reality landscape allows the writers a lot of creative freedom to place the characters in very unusual circumstances. Perhaps, the best of them is the eighth episode &quot;Cinncinnati&quot;, where the audience finally gets a real taste for how evil and committed the series' villain, Omar Santiago, is. His quest for supreme domination and the establishment of his fascist society shows its true colors.The two main characters: Hobbes (Scott Bairstow) and Pinnochio (D.B. Sweeney) are essentially polar opposites. Hobbes is the good all-American soldier, which for the most part makes him a caricature of sorts, though he does have some shining moments. Pinnochio is not a bad guy, he's honorable, but he's also jaded and his loyalties are questionable at times. This makes him a much more interesting character than Hobbes, and it is a shame we didn't get the chance to see his character develop. As for the other players: Florence (the mute healer/soldier), Sophie (Hobbe's fiance), Inga Fossa (the duplicitous informant), Waters (Hobbes former friend turned enemy) and Omar Santiago (a Hitler-esque fascist dictator)...they make their contributions here and there, but we never got to learn too much about them. The only real exception being Santiago who gets fleshed out very well in &quot;Cinncinnati&quot;.This was not one Chris Carter's finest moments, but it may have developed into something special if given the time. Millennium, too, had a rocky start, but found it's loyal viewers. Perhaps, on DVD, it will be given the opportunity to shine for the first time. I, for one, am looking forward to seeing these episodes on DVD, and the various extras provided within the boxset.&quot;It's just a game...&quot; </p>

 <p> After seeing the most recent X-Files movie, I heard an audience member mention that one character, Inga Fossa, had the same name in the TV show Harsh Realm. All I remembered was the following: it got cancelled after only airing 3 episodes.With no time like the present, I picked up this box set and watched all the episodes in about 3 days. After finishing it, I think it's a little cruel and dismissive to call this show a "Poor Man's Matrix". There's a lot of potential here, and with a few tweaks, this could have been a show that rivaled the X-Files in popularity.The premise is simple enough - Omar Santiago (Terry O'Quinn) is the top player in a virtual reality simulation called Harsh Realm. He rules this post-apocalyptic world with an iron fist, and to date, no one has been able to beat him. Tom Hobbes (Scott Bairstow) is sent in by the U.S. Government to kill Santiago. However, once inside Harsh Realm, Hobbes discovers he is trapped there until Santiago is killed - only then can he return to reality. Along the way, Hobbes picks up some unlikely allies - Mike Pinocchio (D.B. Sweeney), a Gulf War veteran with a Han Solo attitude, and Florence (Rachel Hayward), a mute VC (Virtual Character) with the ability to heal other characters in Harsh Realm. This trio sets out to eliminate Santiago and free Harsh Realm from his oppressive tyranny.Right away, there are several contradictions - we are told that Santiago can move in and out of Harsh Realm, but there are no episodes that actually show him doing this. We are told that there is no concept of an afterlife or religion in Harsh Realm, yet one of the central characters in a later episode is a priest. Worst of all, we only get a hint of Santiago's plans to make Harsh Realm all that remains of the "real world" - how he plans to do this is never disclosed.A few episodes introduce unique technology: weapons that can freeze Virtual Characters, Digi-Wands, Jump Points and Glitches. Sadly, most of these technologies were shown in the 6 episodes that aired after Harsh Realm's cancellation.The DVD Treatment: Two audio commentary tracks are on the pilot episode, but they do not include D.B. Sweeney or Scott Bairstow. There are TV spots/ads for Harsh Realm, and a neat little feature on the creation of the logo & intro sequence for the series.Chris Carter and two of his colleagues offer their thoughts on the creation and cancellation of Harsh Realm - not surprisingly, the lawsuit between Carter and the creators of theHarsh Realm comicwere left out of this featurette.If I had to guess, the reasons Harsh Realm failed were as follows:(1) This show started out in the "Friday Night Death Slot" - there's a long history of TV shows that get cancelled because of a late time slot on Friday nights, and with only 3 aired episodes, Harsh Realm never had a chance.(2) "Poor Man's Matrix" theory: The Matrix came out 6 months before Harsh Realm hit the airwaves. This is an unfair comparison, simply because both touch on the idea of a virtual world. Harsh Realm had more of a Quantum Leap premise, with Bairstow's character trying to get back to his fianc&eacute; in the real world.(3) The episodes with the best scripting were not aired early enough. For example, Terry O'Quinn gave his best performance in the series in "Cincinnati" - he showcases his character's ruthlessness, intelligence, and ability to lead others through intimidation. Another example is "Manus Domini": this episode showed a vulnerable side to the Mike Pinocchio character - his fear of finding faith in a world without it.If a few episodes that centered on Santiago's plans in the real world were scripted and aired early enough, it could have given Harsh Realm the fan base it needed to keep on the air. Alas, we will never know.If you're a fan of shows like theThe X-Files,MillenniumorQuantum Leap, I'm sure you'll enjoy this box set.Sure, the series leaves you with more questions than answers.Welcome to HARSH REALM. </p>

 <p> Before watching Harsh Realm on DVD I was under the solid impression that any canceled series (e.g. Firefly, Wonderfalls, Deadwood, Huff, Dead Like Me, Miracles, Veronica Mars - you get the idea!) was better than just about anything currently on the networks.  Harsh Realm is one of the exceptions to the rule.Don't get me wrong, it's enjoyable enough to watch.  But it's all just cotton candy.HR suffered from massive holes in its plot and the obvious arrogance of its producers who thought they could placate their audience with multiple dead end cul de sac episodes that contributed nothing toward advancing the arc of the larger plot.HR's biggest plot point was that Santiago, the man who had taken over the virtual reality game, could somehow destroy the real world.  It's nonsense on two counts - how is such a thing possible?  And how could the game continue if the real world no longer existed?  Another gnawing flaw was the idea that the VR world was identical to the real world in every possible way,as if not just people were copied, but their entire life histories as well.  Just how could the government know every single possible detail about every human in the country?One of the lessons that the producers of shows like "Lost" and "Battlestar Galactica" (season 3 mostly) discovered is that you can't get away with multiple dead end episodes.  In Harsh Realm we basically get the first two episodes that advance the larger plot and then it's essentially abandoned.I actually enjoyed watching the show.  But the reasons for its cancellation were rather obvious. </p>

 <p> I'm not sure how long this series could have gone on, set as it was in mostly a virtual world of alternate reality.  The point of it all is not yet clear to me, as I am still working my way through all three discs of the one and only season.  However, it was a frightening and compelling concept, with DB Sweeney, Scott Bairstow, and Terry O'Quinn as the main characters and Chris Carter as the brain behind it all.It's entertaining enough to be worth a rental if not a purchase. </p>

 <p> "Harsh Realm" was meant to be Fox's Great White Hope for the 1999 season. Created by "The X-Files" Chris Carter, the show borrowed pages from "The X-Files" and "The Matrix. General Santiago (O'Quinn) has taken over a virtual reality program named Harsh Realm. Originally developed by the military to give a realistic simulation of how the world would react to a terrorist strike, the military has sent in a number of operatives to take out the elusive Santiago but none have returned. Lt. Hobbes (Bairstow) plans on leaving the military in a month after serving for five years in war torn areas around the world. A hero for saving a friend at the expense of his own life, Hobbes is asked by his C.O. (Henriksen) to go into the game and beat Santiago bringing it to an end. He's told nothing else about Harsh Realm or  about the "occupants" that exist there. What he finds is a virtual reality simulation of the real world. With the help of Mike Pinnochio (D. B. Sweeney) Hobbes must try and complete his mission and find a way out of Harsh Realm to his fianc&eacute; (Samantha Mathis) and the life he left behind.Critically drubbed and abandoned by its audience within the first week of its premiere, "Harsh Realm" was a rare failure for Carter as it was cancelled after only airing three episodes. Carter and Fox also faced legal action when James D. Hudnall and Andrew Paquette the creators of the comic book series "Harsh Realm" sued Fox and won recognition that their work was the basis for Carter's series. While the basic premise and title were similar enough to suggest that Carter had been influenced by the comic book series, "Harsh Realm" the TV series departed radically from the initial premise of Hudnall and Paquette's creation.It's sad, really, as the show has its moments and the supporting performances of D. B. Sweeney and Terry O'Quinn make even the weakest episode shine. Carter's initial premise had as much promise as another abandoned Fox show ("Sliders") in that it would have allowed him to examine many different issues in an "alternate" reality. "Harsh Realm" doesn't pick up steam or break any new ground like "The X-Files" or even "Millennium" did but the story potential for the series was great.Although grainy newsreel like style used in "Black Hawk Down" bookends the first episode, the transfer is far from "harsh". The solid blacks and vivid colors are brilliantly realized and provide a sharp contrast to the gloomy scenes set in the virtual reality world. Although the box says the series is presented in 1.33:1 full screen mode, it's actually in what appears to be a 1.76:1 widescreen mode. It's evident how expensive the series was from the very first frame of footage. The stark sequences set in the former Sarevjo have epic big screen production values and the fine detail set in the destroyed city looks terrific. The 5.1 soundtrack, unlike most shows from the same time frame, uses the format pretty effectively. The result is that you feel like ducking whenever a helicopter swings by or someone shoots off a machine gun. The sound has considerable presence and depth as well.The three disc set features all nine episodes of the series so, needless to say, there's not a whole lot in the way of extra features. On the other hand, Fox has priced this boxed set accordingly. The two featurettes mimic those of the "Millennium" set. We get a standard behind-the-scenes featurette about the creation and production of the series. I got the impression that Fox produced this while the series was shooting in anticipation of eventually releasing it to DVD. There's also a clever, well thought out featurette on the creation of the show's main titles much like a similar featurette for "Millennium".Chris Carter and director Sackheim provide a single commentary track on the pilot. It's rather interesting as Carter discusses some of his casting decisions in the commentary track as well as the inspiration of the series (while avoiding the painful topic of the lawsuit he and Fox faced). While supposedly the lawsuit had no bearing on the cancellation of the series, I'm sure that it helped contributed to tension between Carter and Fox thus hasting the untimely demise of the show. Unfortunately, none of these issues is discussed (although its understandable as to why). It's too bad that there's no commentary track by writers/producers John Shiban and Frank Spotniz. Like Carter, both are veterans of "The X-Files" and "Millennium" and their episodes are, like Carter's initial ones, real gems that offered much promise for this critically attacked series.Although it certainly couldn't live up to "The X-Files" (or, for that matter, "Millennium") due to its short life, "Harsh Realm" demonstrates that a great premise isn't necessarily the best springboard for well written television. The episodes included here indicated that "Harsh Realm" had developed an interesting story arc. "Homicide: Life on the Street" and even "NYPD Blue" didn't offer much originality in the "premise" department. It was the striking writing and character development that made those series so memorable. The same could have occurred with "Harsh Realm". I'd suggest giving the series a chance despite the fact that the cliff ending ninth episode leaves the series unfinished and hanging. </p>
