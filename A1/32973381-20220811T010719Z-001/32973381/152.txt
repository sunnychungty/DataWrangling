<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> dumb, brutal, and kind of interesting </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I can add little to existing reviews of this film save to say that, after being generally disgusted with the movie -- a cheap exploitation film with many flaws -- I was nonetheless spellbound by the final images of the movie, where the too-too sullied melting man just slumps against a wall and... melts. Nevermind the makeup; something about the scene (which probably seems a lot longer in my memory than it actually was) is extremely effective and disturbing. It's one of the most effective images of human mortality that I can recall seeing in cinema. It's been a long time, mind you; I recall the sun coming up, swelling music, a sense that something epic was happening as the guy liquefied, and I may be adding a bit of that in myself. Still, it's worth the watch for horror fans. </p>

 <p> I am writing this review, seeing that Shout Factory, now owning the rights to The Incredible Melting Man, will hopefully, very soon release the MST3K version on dvd in the near future. Aside from some good gory effects by Rick Baker, this movie really is cheesy. However, it was perfect for MST3K and the episode is a favorite of mine and my whole families. The jokes they did on there are spot-on. Shout Factory has this one and, hopefully, they'll get the Squirm episode on dvd pretty soon, too. </p>

 <p> Well...it's original, I'll give you that.  But... </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This was definately the funniest MST3K episode I've seen, at least among the Comedy Central seasons. From beginning ("That was one hot burrito!" chirps Tom Servo as astronaut Steve gets fried) to end ("So how many monster movies end with a janitor scooping a monster into a garbage can?" asks Crow), the laughs in the episode don't stop!Yet I have to admit, this movie was made more professionally than many of the junk films shown on MST3K; in fact, it's a rather entertaining feature, that is if you're into disgusting monster movies with nasty killings (the severed head crashing from the waterfall is a nice touch). Sure, there are a few serious flaws, most especially Burr DeBenning's priceless performance. I say "priceless" because there isn't any non-Ed Wood actor on Earth who can out bad-act him! It's kind of charming the way he treats the whole deadly-serious situation with the same expression as he would have when shopping for groceries! Then again, could you really do a better job than him in the scene carrying a geiger-counter in some California park while screaming your lungs out, "STEVE! IT'S DOCTOR TED NELSON!" I thought so.Still, the film kind of won me over anyway. It's sort of shocking that a talent like Rick Baker (who just a year prior to this movie made the huge "King Kong" remake) was in this low-class B-movie, but his make-up effects standout, turning what could have otherwise been a silly monster idea into something stunningly horrific. The score is classic 70's cheese (right down to the synthesizers), yet in a memorable way, it's good 70's cheese. And yes, how could I forget the horny grandparents in this movie! To the two actors who give every ounce of energy playing them, my props to you guys. YOU ROCK! You carried the movie on your fragile little shoulders, especially you go-go boots-wearing grandma! (whom Mike refers to as "the Incredible Melting Grandma"!).Three stras for the actual feature, 10 for the MST3K version. </p>

 <p> I'm amazed to see that somebody is taking the time to commit this cinematic atrocity to Blu-ray!  This is an AWFUL movie.  It's a super-low-budget exploitation flick, so if you're looking for a horror film that has people you care about (or at least find interesting), a coherent storyline, or anything you'd expect from even a B-grade horror flick, you won't find any of that here.  The ONLY way to see this movie is if you're watching Mike and the 'bots rip it to shreds on MST3K (6th or 7th season... I don't remember which offhand).  You have been warned. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Gross fun for horror and cult movie fans </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN is touted on the video box as "The first new horror creature" (This is of course in 1977). With earlier 70s horror classics helping usher in a new era of grossness and graphic violence; among them  THE GORE GORE GIRLS ('72), THE EXORCIST('73), THE OMEN & CARRIE (both '76); it's inevitable that someone should update the old creature features of the nuclear 1950s with the newer, innovative gross-out factor audiences the world over were pining for (Not me. I wasn't born until 1980).Writer/Director William Sachs and the legendary Rick Baker delivered that in spades with their 1977 cult classic THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN.Following an accident in space, the sole survivor; astronaut Steven West (Alex Rebar) awakens in hospital to find his flesh is melting and he is slowly going insane. Of course he does what anyone would do when faced with a distressing situation like this: he chases a chubby nurse down the corridor with a towel dangling from one nostril resulting in Nursey running through a pane glass window in slo-mo while being pursued by the Incredible Melting Man. Hilarious stuff.After escaping West/Melting Man does what any other B horror creature would do. He goes on a violent rampage because the radiation is making his killer instinct grow and also making him stronger- but his mind is also decomposing. Pretty soon his collegue Dr Ted Nolan (Burr DeBenning) and the police are trying to stop the rampaging maniac before he infects the entire town.INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN is actually pretty shallow, but how could you hate a movie like this? Amusing bits include the head of one of the Melting Man's victims floating downstream and over a waterfall and a couple of kids aged around 10 smoking. Oh no! How injurious to the  NZ public good! Anyway their game of hide and seek goes awry when the girl finds some "sticky stuff" on a tree. What it is is anyone's guess. (No, it's not sasquatch snot).If, like me you get excited when you come across a really bad horror movie you'll definately get a kick out of this. MELTING MAN is true midnight movie material. Baker's FX are what make this worth watching- especially the finale.PS: Several of the actors had their voices dubbed for this movie (including Rebar).PPS: Yes, there is a brief flash of boobies; so INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN has all the ingredients that make a cult movie special. Check it out. </p>

 <p> An astronaut flies through the rings of Saturn, returns to earth, and begins the hideous melting process of the title. He escapes his restraints, lumbers out of the hospital, and goes on an oozing rampage of death and icky-ness. Rick Baker's practical fx are the only "serious" reason to watch THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN, unless you are hopelessly addicted to cheeeze (like me!). Baker manages to repay his debt to society for unleashing OCTAMAN upon us, some years prior. His slimy, sloshy goo-man is a wonder of disgusting bliss! Add in the mechanical acting, imbecilic dialog, and 70s ambiance, and it's party time! A must-own classic... </p>

 <p> When astronaut Steven West returns to earth from a visit to Saturn, he brings back with him a horrible disease that very literally begins melting away his flesh! This hideous affliction is further worsened when the poor man realizes he must turn cannibal in order to survive.William Sachs directs from a screenplay that, believe it or not, updates the old 1950's sci-fi film &quot;First Man Into Space.&quot; I personally got a rise out of Rick Baker's gory special effects. To say they're merely convincing would be an understatement. The stuff on display in this flick is positively unsettling! For a movie released in the late 70's, this really delivers the gruesome goods. While the story's premise may seem laughable, at times even more farfetched, the tried and true horror buff should find something to savor here. The ending is a particular sight to behold. One, I'm sure, you'll never forget. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I cannot say anything about the quality of the disc, I have not seen it  yet, but the movie...An astronaut flies his spaceship through the rings  of Saturn and gets some kind of space bug in the process (you can tell this  because he looks like he's trying to hold back a sneeze as his nose begins  to bleed).  When he returns to earth he begins to melt and needs to drink  blood and eat flesh to slow/stop the process.  This allows him to kill  everyone he bumps into during the films short running time.  Interestingly  enough, it seems that the Incredible Melting Man gets stronger as he melts.  I am still waiting for the sequel...The Invincible Puddle of Glop.But  you have to see it for Rick Baker's effects, they are superb. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> It's hard to recommend this film, as the acting is pretty bad, the script is awful and the pacing is glacial.  But the effects, oh, the effects.One of Rick Baker's earlier works, the effects are cheap but effective.  And director William Sachs claims the film was suppose to be a spoof, but the comedic elements were eliminated when the producers decided a straight up horror film was more commercially viable.It's too bad, as this movie would have been ripe for some comedic elements.  But I had to get this one, as it was one of the first R-rated horror films I saw in the theaters.  Were it not for that nostalgic element, I probably wouldn't have spent the money to add it to my collection.As with other DVDs in the MGM Limited Edition Collection, the film has not been cleaned up, but the picture is pretty clear and good quality.  Alas, the only extra is the trailer, another shortcoming of the DVD-R format.If you're looking to find examples of Baker's early work, or just love low budget horror films, The Incredible Melting Man is worth checking out.  All others, you have been warned.  You might want to stay away. </p>

 <p> So Bad It Has To Be Seen </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> For years I panned this film and warned people away from it, and finally realized that everyone SHOULD see it - to see how bad a film can be.  Without darkness, there is no light.  Without Pain there is no joy.  And without Bad, how can you ever truly appreciate Good?Suprisingly, this film is like a colage of every good bit ever shown in horror/sci-fi - from 'First Man in Outer Space' to 'Night of the Living Dead', to 'The Devil's Rain'.  Rick Baker's makeup effects are awesome, but they are wasted in a film that has no plot, no acting, no coherence, and no point.  Case in point: Baker created a very realistic looking decapitated head, which the Title creature tore from some hapless fisherman's shoulders.  The film spends a good 10 to 15 minutes following this gory appliance downstream - bumping into various rocks, trees and other flotsam, until it finally tumbles off a decorative waterfall and bursts open graphically when it hits bottom.  In the following scenes various kids and grownups wander past the waterfall, and every scene inspires the thought: "They're gonna find the head and call the police!"  thereby bringing some point to the amount of film spent on its journey downstream.  Nope.  The head is never seen again.  Believe me - THIS IS THE WORST FILM EVER MADE - and you HAVE to see it just to say you have seen the worst movie ever made...Oh, and p.s. - I own it. </p>

 <p> One of the bigger low budget horror films in the 1970s has made it to DVD via MGM MOD, while it may not be the pressed disc official release the transfer of this is really outstanding. It looks great in 18 x 9 widescreen with daytime scenes looking overall spectacular as well as the night scenes also being well done.As for the film itself, for those not familiar with it, it is about a man , Steve (Alex Rebar) who is the survivor of three astronauts who fly to Saturn and get attacked by the planets radioactivity. He wakes up in a hospital bed only to find himself melting into a sticky gooey thing and needs blood to survive. He escapes from the hospital and is pursued by his friend, Dr. Ted Nelson (Burr Debenning) from the remainder of the film. Great special melting gore effects by Rick Baker. This also has B Movie legend Myron Healy as a General and Cheryl Rainbeaux Smith as a model. This has a little nudity and a modest amount of gore but nothing like a Lucio Fulci or Dario Argento gorefest. It has its campy moments, a little tongue  in cheek and some lousy acting, but that's what makes these movies fun ! :)The running time for this is 86 minutes, so as to whether it is 'uncut' or not I would say it could very well be. I have seen the Vipco DVD which was an awful Alpha Video looking transfer and the CMV laservision which was letterboxed and both seemed to be around the same running time.The DVD also contains a full screen trailer.I would say any fan of the film should pick this one up because it looks as good as its going to get and it is our long overdue USA release. MOD or not, this movie is a keeper for anyone who loves this genre. </p>

 <p> "The Incredible Melting Man" Oozes on to Blu-ray </p>

 <p> Scream Factory continues its reign as the kings of classic horror restorers with the release of "The Incredible Melting Man" on Blu-ray. Here's a movie most home entertainment companies would look at and giggle when presented with the opportunity to give it a proper high-definition transfer. Not Scream Factory. They're more than willing to pony up the cash to give cult followers of this 1977 schlock-fest what they want.Astronaut Steve West (Alex Rebar) wakes up in a hospital after a trip to Saturn and discovers he's melting. His body is literally turning gelatinous before his (and our) very eyes. His new "condition" drives him mad and gives him an appetite for human flesh. When word of Rebar's escape gets out, Doctor Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning) and General Michael Perry (Myron Healey) must track him down before he does any more harm to innocent civilians or himself.If ever there was a film ripe to be given the Mystery Science Theater 3000 or Horror Remix treatment, "The Incredible Melting Man" would definitely be a "high-priority" candidate. Everyone knows about "Mystery Science Theater 3000." If you don't live in certain areas of the country, you may not be familiar with a "Horror Remix." Horror Remixes whittle your standard 90-minute horror or slasher film down to its bare necessities, which usually brings the running time in at 30 to 35 minutes. As they say, "It's All Killer, No Filler."So much time is wasted with the Incredible Melting Man stumbling around through the woods. We also get highly awkward close-ups of actor Burr DeBenning. Another entertaining sequence features some of the most useless bantering between an old idiotic couple who run into our tragic anti-hero while walking in the woods to steal lemons. Yes, it's as ridiculous as it sounds... and I love it! Add to all this a giant dose of awful dialogue and badly timed editing and you have a true low-budget feast.The real star of "The Incredible Melting Man" is Rick Baker's makeup effects. The oozing and dripping globs of dissolving flesh are genuinely nasty. Scenes of half-eaten limbs and a partially disintegrated head only add to the stomach-churning fun. There's nothing quite like watching an eyeball slip slowly out of its socket and run down the gooey face of the lead character. Baker's handiwork leaves you wanting to take a shower after viewing the film."The Incredible Melting Man" was originally released in 1977 and was rated R. It has everything you would expect in a low-budget sci-fi/horror flick from that time period. There's plenty of gore, violence, bad language, and one scene of nudity. Did we need the nudity? I don't think so, but every producer of these types of films did back then.Although its Blu-ray transfer definitely makes "The Incredible Melting Man" easier on the eyes, it doesn't rob it of any of its raw, "real" film flavor. The movie is presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (1.78:1). Unfortunately, all we get is DTS-HD Master Audio Mono as far as sound is concerned. A 5.1 surround upgrade would have been ideal, but it still sounds better than it has in any other released format.As is to be expected, Scream Factory's Blu-ray debut of "The Incredible Melting Man" comes with impressive special features. Audio commentary is provided by Director/Writer William Sachs. There are also new interviews with Director/Writer Sachs and Academy Award-Winning Special Makeup Effects Artists Rick Baker and Greg Cannom. Theatrical trailers round out the bonus material."The Incredible Melting Man" is obviously not for everyone. If you're a film snob only interested in high-brow cinema you won't appreciate this piece of horror history. This is for lovers of B-movies dripping with terrible acting that are so bad they're good. Once again, Scream Factory deserves a hearty pat on the back for all the work they put into preserving these lost cinema classics. </p>

 <p> You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll laugh so hard that you'll cry. I seriously doubt that director William Sachs (HITZ - 1988) had this in mind when he was making this so-bad-it's-good horror film whose only redeeming values are the gruesome effects by Rick Baker. When astronaut Steve West (Alex Rebar, who would later write and executive produce DEMENTED  and executive produce TERROR ON TOUR - both 1980) is contaminated while viewing the Sun through Saturn's rings during Scorpio 5's mission, he is the only one to come home alive. Unfortunately he is slowly melting and needs human blood and skin to stay alive. He tears off half the face of the attending nurse while escaping into the woods. He then tears the head off a fisherman (we see his head floating down the river, eventually dropping down a waterfall and splitting wide open in slow motion). Dr. Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning), an old friend of Steve's, is sent out to look for him with a geiger counter (since Steve is, of course, radioactive), all on the hush-hush since the Government doesn't want to scare the populace. Ted walks around the woods yelling: &#34;Steve! It's Ted Nelson! I've come to help you!&#34;, before finding Steve's ear lying on the ground. (I guess Steve couldn't hear him!) A bunch of smoking youngsters and a horny elderly couple are the next to run into Steve. Fortunately, the kids escape Steve but the elderly couple are not so lucky. There's also a rather nasty electrocution. The film is so chock full of absurd situations that MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 did a great job of poking fun of it in their 7th season. It's one of their best episodes that has yet to reach the market. The best part has to be Ted yelling at two security guards: &#34;I'm Ted Nelson! I'm Ted Nelson!&#34; before one of the guards puts a bullet in his head. As if being Ted Nelson meant anything! I had a great time just watching the film straight as Steve begins to decompose until he is nothing but a pile of multi-colored goo that is swept up by a janitor. American International was hoping to have a new franchise on their hands with this one, advertising it as &#34;The First New Horror Creature&#34;. After watching it, the executives must have had a heart attack. Hey, I love bad horror films. They fill a badly-needed void in a horror fan's soul. THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN will fill that void for a good couple of months. Also starring horror and western vet Myron Healey, Michael Alldredge, Ann Sweeney and the late, great Cheryl Rainbeaux Smith as a topless photographer's model. A Vestron Video VHS Release. Available on Blu-Ray/DVD from Shout! Factory. This is the one to get if you want to watch the film in all its original aspect, unedited glory. Rated R. </p>

 <p> This classic from the seventies is about a astronaut returning to earth with a infected virus that makes him melt, then melting man goes on a hunger for human flesh. This movie is hardcore for the seventies with early FX by Rick Baker. MGM did a excellent job on the release the picture, and audio are clear, also we get a theater trailer as well. The movie is on dvd-r, but still it's a official release by MGM. It took a long time for this classic to hit dvd, get you copy before it's out of print! </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: *** NOT A FILM SUITABLE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN ***The most amazing thing about "The Incredible Melting Man" is the trailer. It plays on a few other genre videos as a preview, and it is a very impressive, though not because of its high-production values. Essentially, a uniformed nurse is screaming as she flees from something which without warning bursts explosively through a glass door in pursuit. After seeing this trailer a few dozen times I gave in and bought the video.IN A NUTSHELL: RICK BAKER HAS WON 6 OSCARS FOR BEST MAKE-UPRick Baker does a decent job with the limited time and money available to create an ozzing, yukky glob-man. Due to a space-borne virus or radiation, [sci-fi connection] a recently returned astronaut, the sole survivor of a doomed expedition to the rings of Saturn, is compelled to eat human cells to relieve the pain. This, along with the extreme disfigurement, that makes him appear like a latex man covered in dripping maple syrup, has driven him into madness.SIMILAR TO "THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT" BUT MORE EXPLICIT HORROR:Yes, this is a lot like The Quatermass Xperiment, directed by Val Guest and released in 1955. The earlier British film had more plot, made more sense, and of course was quite chilling. The Incredible Melting Man, on the other hand, has most of the science-fiction and characerizations missing in exchange for a fairly grisly mutant-vampire rampage.-- PRODUCTION CREW -- [DELIBERATELY LISTED BEFORE ACTORS]-----*- William Sachs  - Director / Screenwriter-----*- Rick Baker  - Makeup / Special Effects / Makeup Special Effects-- PRINCIPAL ACTORS -------*- Alex Rebar  - Steve West, The Incredible Melting Man-----*- Burr de Benning  - Dr. Ted Nelson-----*- Myron Healey  - Gen.

 <p> Astronaut Steve just had a routine mission to Saturn to investigate the rings but yet something went wrong and a week later he is sent to a hospital back on Earth. He discovers his skin is literally slowly melting away and he runs away from the hospital as he attacks some innocent people to feed on their flesh/blood in order to keep his cells balanced. Dr. Ted Nelson (Burr Debenning) tracks him down as he must try to save him.A jaw droppingly so bad it's good Sci-fi horror film from writer-director William Saches was inspired by those EC horror and sci-fi comics of the 50's and a bit from Night of the Living Dead. The plot is simple but there is some excellent make-up effects by Rick Baker and Greg Cannom with some gore abound, there is silly  scenes and overacting abound. It's an enjoyable and decent low budget film that has gained a cult following as i did saw it on video when i was 6 and thought it was gross yet neat and it made one of the best episodes of MST3K.The blu-ray offers a solid transfer on PQ and nice extras like commentary, interviews with the director/Rick Baker/Greg Cannom, photo gallery, trailers and radio spots, Scream Factory has done it again. Now if Shout can only release the MST3K version soon. </p>

 <p> The ending scene in this superlative film set an unusually high standard for special effects in cinema.  We see the poor man sitting there, the live actor, skin all runny and saggy -- then, seamlessly, he dissolves right before our eyes.  I have lain awake nights contemplating how they achieved that effect, for there was no cutaway, no editing, no shift of view:  The man simply melted.  One explanation is that the real actor truly did melt because we certainly never saw him again after this flick. </p>

 <p> Clearly, this campy outing ranks with "Night of the Lepus" and "X-The Man with the X-Ray Eyes", but you can't help the emotional attachment that underscores a story rich in special effects...the songs "I Fall to Pieces" and "Stuck on You" come to mind.  "The Incredible Melting Man" derives its energy from the hapless victim of a space flight gone horribly wrong - Alex Rebar in his singular most notable (and only) acting stint, plays Steve, one of three astronauts who fly by the rings of Saturn - Steve announces his exhilaration at how the sun looks through those rings (his last transmission)...  Now, being treated at an earth-based hospital - his two companion astronauts having succumbed to a deadly space disease - Steve literally comes apart...losing body weight the old fashioned way...a piece or two at a time.  Not for the squeamish - you will laugh, you will cry - you will see a man literally dissolve in a gooey mass that reminds you of the last time you left your Three Musketeers bar outside in the hot car...you can't look away!  This movie follows the themes of "The Quatermass Experiment (The Creeping Unknown)" and "The First Man into Space".  Rick Baker provides stunning special effects...I remember making a large pot of chocolate oatmeal, peanut butter drop cookies shortly after seeing this movie and marveling at the gooey, sticky batch - sweet! </p>

 <p> This is certainly an enjoyable film if you like these older offerings (like I do), but I doubt, if one is not a lover of this kind of movie, that it will capture everyone's interest. But a movie that features a bloody melted goop being scooped up into the trash can isn't going to please every taste now is it (c'mon, the ending is obvious from the title)? I, however, enjoyed it much, and found the humor and gore effects interesting.As for this Scream/Shout! release, it is immaculate in every way. I can't believe that William Sachs blamed this movie on his mother, but that was a hilarious interview. The picture is widescreen and thoroughly cleaned up (or at least it appeared so to me), so you needn't worry about any lack of TLC in the transfer. It's as great of a presentation (and as similar a format) as the current SHOUT! releases of &#34;The Town that Dreaded Sundown,&#34; &#34;Lifeforce,&#34; and &#34;Rolling Thunder&#34; (all favorites of mine now), so there's no complaints from my end.Overall, if you enjoy science fiction, horror, mystery films, or just old-fashioned B movie exploitation, this one will be for you. If you aren't in our camp, then I expect you wouldn't be on this page! Peace all of you fellow B-movie addicts. Shout! is up to some good business, and I can only hope they keep it coming. </p>

 <p> First of all: the digital transfer to Blu-ray is simply astonishing. Image quality is fantastic, for a movie made in 1977. No trouble here.As for the movie itself, I'm into the category of fans that Rick Baker describes at the extras: people who were 10-13 years old when watched this movie for the first time, were terrified by it, and reserved a place in their hearts (a small one, that's true) to it.So, I watched it for the second time only now after buying the Blu-ray. And I was not disappointed. The killing of the victims is not outrageously in your face (none of them are explicit), acting is wood but not cynical, effects are good for the time and low budget.You feel sorry for astronaut Steve and for his victims at the same time, something very unusual.This is a doom film, no happy ending (but no meaning at all also). How the heck the guy got stronger at the same time he was melting, I'll never know. </p>

 <p> The Incredible Melting Man is a delightfully bad 1977 sci-fi/ horror about ill-fated astronaut Steve West (Alex Rebar) who returns from a space mission exploring Saturn&#8217;s rings with a mysterious condition where his flesh is melting and he is radioactive. For some reason, just as mystifying as to how he got this way, (there is a hint it was caused by viewing the sun through Saturn&#8217;s rings but, it&#8217;s never confirmed.) Steve must consume human flesh to slow down the degeneration. As his mind degenerates too, West escapes the hospital and begins to chow down on the locals while he is pursued by friend Dr. Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning) and Air Force General Perry (Myron Healey). As Steve melts more and more, the more locals, including Nelson&#8217;s in-laws, fall victim to the stricken astronaut who becomes less and less human by the minute. Can he be stopped? Can the process be reversed? Who will be his next meal? All the questions are answered and if this kind of flick is your thing, you&#8217;ll have a fun time watching the answers unfold. Despite it&#8217;s less then 90 minute running time the film is methodically paced. There are a lot of scenes of West roaming around the countryside with the last moments of the mission playing over and over in his head while Dr. Nelson follows his trail with his handy geiger counter. Most of the attacks are off camera thought there are plentiful shots of the gory carnage and one great shot of a dismembered head going over a waterfall and smashing on the rocks below. Aside from the gore and melting FX, which were done by the now legendary RIck Baker, there is plenty of hilariously bad dialog and unintentional laugh inducing situations. The film by writer/director William Sachs (Galaxina), has an uneven tone, though it&#8217;s supposedly not all his fault. Sachs claims he wanted something more campy and fun like the sci-fi flicks of the 50s, while the producers wanted a more serious horror flick and these artistic differences give the movie an unbalanced mix of serious moments and much lighter moments. But, the thing is, some of the more serious scenes come across as unintentionally funny and some of the humorous scenes meant to be funny, aren&#8217;t successful in their attempt and just come across as awkward. So they are entertaining but, not for the right reasons. Sachs just doesn&#8217;t quite have the right touch to mix horror and camp as say, Joe Dante did in Piranha and The Howling though, it would appear that&#8217;s what he was going for. But, either way, this production&#8217;s heart is in the right place and the really cool work by future Oscar winner Baker is very effective&#8230; and of course all the intentional and unintentional entertainment it provides, is worth watching it for. The filmmakers were really trying hard here to deliver a new and horrifying movie monster but, the talent (aside from Baker) is just not quite there behind or in front of the camera and the disagreement between director and producers doesn&#8217;t help either. The acting is just as bad as the before mentioned dialog and the inept cast stumbling around finding body parts both of the victims and the Melting Man, produce far more laughs then chills. Also, some of the conversations between gore scenes are hilariously inappropriate, given the situations the characters are in and it&#8217;s hard to tell how much of this was intentional and how much was not but, it&#8217;s entertaining either way so, ultimately, it doesn&#8217;t really matter. To a degree Sachs got the kind of campy fun movie he was trying to make but, it&#8217;s not totally on purpose. Made by the legendary American International Pictures, Melting Man has earned cult classic status and has become one of MST3K&#8217;s funnier episodes and if you are a connoisseur of &#8216;so bad it&#8217;s good&#8217; cinema then this is a prime example. The added nostalgia of this late 70s flick only makes it even more fun. The kind of movie they sadly don&#8217;t make anymore and a personal guilty pleasure of mine. Thankfully Melting Man is now available on a gorgeous extra filled blu-ray from the folks at Scream Factory! </p>

 <p> When I was a young(er) lad than I am now, back in the late 70's, I spent one particular day full of excitement, as we had planned to go to the cinema to seeSavage Bees, The, which, for reasons relating to my age and perhaps not knowing any better, I was quite excited about.  Imagine my despair and anguish then, when we reached the cinema, a half hour train journey away, only for me to be turned away.  It turned out that although the certification for "The Savage Bees" was PG, the accompanying feature (this being in the 70's and in the days of double features), "The Incredible Melting Man", was not and I could not get in to see either of the movies as a result.  I spent a train journey home with my mum, rubbing some `dust from my eye' vowing that one day I would see this film.Well, thanks to this bluray release, that time has come, and I finally saw what I had been missing all these years... one of the most awfully acted and directed movies of a time when cheap and nasty movies were abundant.  It has two qualities which redeem it slightly - it falls into the `so-bad-its-good' category, in aPlan 9 From Outer Space [Blu-ray] kind of way, making it quite chuckle worthy if you are in that frame of mind - and one can only imagine that you know what you are getting into, when you buy an ultra low budget 70's movie called "The Incredible Melting Man".  The second is Rick Baker's make up, which surely must have inspired the make up for Pizza The Hut in Mel BrooksSpaceballs (25th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray].  It's gloriously gloopy and daft, must have been awful for the actor, but actually is just a little disturbing, when you see eyeballs popping out of sockets etc.  However the tension which the movie seems to spend much time trying to build prior to each killing as the melting man tries to replenish his human cells (yes, really..) is undone by the hammy cries as the pursuer finds some gloop on a tree and declares "My God, it's his ear.."The accompanying interviews seem to indicate that the director had more genuine comedy or pastiche in mind, but whether that is true or not, the result is a mess.  Pardon the pun.  It looks cheap, has hammy acting, was shot on cheapest locations, has almost zero plot.. and although I'd have to say it is in some ways quite unique, I just can't find it in me to give this more than one star, despite Rick Bakers wonderful makeup.(2/10) </p>

 <p> Contains some spoilers. The Incredible Melting Man is an older film that offers viewers a look at the struggle of a man sent to outerspace, but returns infected with a strange disease. He melts! You can see the dripping start in the hospital, where he attacks a nurse and saps their lifeforce to keep himself alive. Spoiler: One scene shows someone's head floating down a stream, and is quite a comical moment in the film. Other than that however, the film is slow paced and rather dull, but mostly due to the lack of really knowing what this man is thinking, other than witnessing his occassional rage and ultimate demise. </p>

 <p> The Incredible Melting Man (William Sachs, 1977)[originally posted 1May2000]I waited twenty-two years and change to see the end of this movie. When it was released, I clamored to go see it so loud my mother, for once, actually relented, on condition. She called the theater and asked if there was any nudity or swearing in the movie (violence was okay, nudity and swearing were no-nos. And my parents wonder why I'm a conservative). The guy who answered the phone said the R rating was all violence-related, and so we went. Twenty minutes into the movie, there's about thirty seconds of bare breasts, at which point I was forcibly (and somewhat loudly) removed form the theater by my mother. For obvious reasons, seeing the rest of this film has been a priority for me ever since. And that was before the name Rick Baker (who did the FX) meant anything to me.So I finally saw the ending.The Incredible melting Man is actually a very bad late-seventies TV movie, or would be if blood, breasts, and beasts were allowed on TV in 1977. It should be noted that those thirty seconds, supplied by seventies softcore mainstay Rainbeaux (yes, Rainbeaux) Smith, are the only nudity in the film. And the young and not-so-lovely Miz Smith isn't the only person duped into doing this mess of a flick who had a somewhat long and storied career--Sachs (who fits the profile himself, having gone on to direct Van Nuys Blvd., The Last Hour, Judgment, and a few other forgettable if enjoyable flicks) managed to hornswoggle some names which had been. or later became, huge. Oddly, one of those is not star Alex Rebar, probably best known as the male lead in Amityville IV: The Evil Escapes. Heh.In any case, Rebar plays Steve West, the only survivor of a space accident somehow involving the rings of Saturn (you're never told quite how) and radiation, the main effect of which is to cause him to slowly liquefy. The only thing that can keep him alive is, of course, massive quantities of human tissue. Thus, our boy can only survive (after escaping from the very badly-secured military hospital) by eating people. Not that it ever makes him any prettier.His main nemesis is Dr. Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning, whose finest moment came in Nightmare on Elm St. 5), an old friend of TIMM's, who's caught between wanting to do the right thing by his pal and following orders from one of the major stars in this film, whose career was obviously well on the way down by this point, Myron Healey. Healey, in his day, was as well-known and well-loved as Edward G. Robinson, but has since faded into obscurity. But if you took a quick look at the over 100 films credited to Healey, you'd know a good number of titles, I think--Laramie, True Grit, South of Rio, etc. etc. ad nauseam. Healey, as a general, is at odds with the sheriff of the town where TIMM is running loose-- the screen debut of Michael Alldredge (V, Scarface, Iron Eagle, About Last Night). You get the idea. There's only one other name that absolutely needs mentioned in here-- the one decent scene in this film (next paragraph) is prefaced by the murder of the actress' boyfriend, played, in one of only five appearances he ever made in front of the camera, by Jonathan Demme. (His roles never got any better, by the way.)The movie isn't completely awful. Rick Baker, who's won a closetful of Oscars, but is probably better known for those movies in years he got passed over (It's Alive!, Squirm, Star Wars-- yes, Star Wars, The Howling, Videodrome, Captain Eo, Wolf, and the one Oscar he got that was actually deserved-- Life), is at his best when he's working on a shoestring busget, and it shows here; few people can make Vaseline as terrifying as it is in a couple of scenes in this movie. And the effects aren't the only good thing here; there's one scene, just one out of two hours of film, that is absolutely stunning. Right after Jonathan Demme gets offed, his girlfriend (scream queen Janus Blythe-- if you never saw The Hills Have Eyes, go rent it NOW) discovers his body. We never see his body, we only see Blythe's wordless reaction, a descent into complete hysterical madness that is a true sight to behold.As for the rest of it, well, you might as well watch one of the "classic" monster movies on TV in the seventies-- Invasion of the Spiders, perhaps, or one of the killer bee flicks. They have about as much plot and better writing. *  </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> It had so much potential but they really didn't capitalize on any of it. Very very cheap, bad music, photography, editing, pretty much everything. Except the make-up from a young Rick Baker (which is the only reason this film is still in any kind of release), everything else was very poorly done. And not poorly done in the way that us old Horror afficionados enjoy, where it's FUN and entertaining. This just drags, is boring, the action is unmotivated, you don't care about the characters... Really, it's only for those die-hard fans like me who want to collect ALL the old exploitation films, not your average Horror viewer who actually demands a GOOD movie. </p>
