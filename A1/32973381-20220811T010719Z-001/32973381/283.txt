 <p> Off the Map is a medical drama created by Jenna Bans, who also serves as an executive producer, with colleagues from Grey's Anatomy, Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers. The series ran on ABC from January 12, 2011 to April 6, 2011, cancelled after only one season. The series is set in a remote South American village, (fish out-of-water) where seven doctors search for reasons that brought each of them to medicine some ran away from society like Doctors without Borders.Main cast:Martin Henderson as Dr. Benjamin "Ben" Keeton -- Keeton is "one of the world's greatest humanitarians," according to Mina and Lily. He was married to Abby and they had a daughter together, but they died during an accident. However, in episode 4 it's revealed that Abby is on life support in the San Miguel Hospital and Ben is keeping her on life support because her trust fund bankrolls the clinic. When EEG scans show no change, Ben must make the decision whether or not to keep his wife on life support. He became involved with Dr. Ryan Clarke some time after the accident, and although they have mostly been on and off, Ben starts to realize he must move on with his life and allows himself to commit to Ryan on a deeper level. When she has to go to New York for a full investigation regarding her heart disease, he decides to temporarily leave the clinic behind and leave with her. In episode 12 Hold on tight he fires Mina for lying to him about being Clark's doctor.Jason Winston George as Dr. Otis Cole -- It is said about Cole that his bark is "just as bad as his bite." Although he is strict while working, off the job he can be extremely silly. He is good friends with Zee, and although they started out as friends with benefits, he realizes he's falling in love with her after she breaks up with him. Cole was once addicted to morphine and heroin and consumes candy to stay clean. When Cole and Minard must retrieve heroin to use as painkillers, he contemplates relapsing, carrying around a stash of heroin for a whole day, before coming clean to Ben, who then takes his heroin and gives him some more candy.Valerie Cruz as Zita Alareina "Zee" Toledo Alvarez -- Zee is the mother hen of the doctors. She shows disapproval towards workplace romances but has developed a casual relationship with Cole. When she finds out it's more a friends with benefits thing for Cole, she ends things between them, but finds herself drawn back in when he's injured during a rescue mission. They are currently contemplating getting back together and try a real relationship.Caroline Dhavernas as Dr. Lily Brenner -- Brenner's fianc&eacute; was killed in a cycling accident after she asked him to go out and get her some cereal. She has an attraction to Ben Keeton, although this was set back by her disapproval at his handling of a patient in "A Doctor Time Out", and is completely ended once she discovers Keeton has gotten back together with Clark. She meets a local farmer named Mateo at the local bar and forms a relationship with him, until she discovers that he and his family grow coca on their land, which is used to make cocaine. Brenner is an extreme control freak and finds it difficult at first to adapt to the unexpected situations in the jungle that regularly break her routine.Zach Gilford as Dr. Tommy Fuller -- Tommy is shown to be a promiscuous and light-hearted character who incurred Cole's wrath quite early on, earning the nickname "Plastics." He is shown to have "barely made his way through medical school" according to Cole. Tommy had a brief crush on Ryan, until he found out she was dating Keeton. He had a relationship with a local girl named Alma, but due to lack of knowledge of each other's language, he finds it difficult to be around her. He eventually gets drunk and sleeps with Minard, after which things become awkward for them. In the episode 11 "Everything as it should be" Tommy gets jealous when a patient become involved with Mina. He tells Brenner this and she says go for it, when he dose he finds Mina in the shower with Phur. Tommy is shown to be upset when he sees Mina and Phur together. He is upset when he realizes that Mina's relationship is more than sex and eggs. In the season finale he finally tells Mina that he has fallen in love with her.Mamie Gummer as Dr. Mina Minard -- Mina is a doctor who "only works solo" and loses confidence easily due to a misdiagnosis earlier in her career that led to the death of a patient, a little boy named Eric. She is highly competitive at work. She owns a chicken named Dinner that was given to her by a grateful patient. In episode 4 Mina says that her father is the head of a major Boston hospital, and when she misdiagnosed Eric he wiped her resume clean of the incident. She appears to have some kind of attraction to Cole after they share some close moments. In episode 8, Mina sleeps with Tommy while she is drunk after a party for her new god-daughter. In episode 12 Hold on tight Mina becomes Ryans doctor without Keeton knowing. At the end of the episode Keeton fires Mina for lying to him and will never let her be Ryan's doctor.Rachelle Lefevre as Dr. Ryan Clark -- Ryan's parents were missionaries, and she grew up all over the world. She was bitten by an assassin bug when she was eight years old which went untreated causing her to develop Chagas disease. Twenty years later, the disease has caused irreversible heart damage and leads her to going into heart failure. She's in an on and off again relationship with Ben Keeton, although he eventually fully commits to her once he realizes it's time for him to move on from his past. When he discovers the truth about Ryan's condition, he is worried sick, which leads to both of them declaring their love for each other. When Ryan has to go to New York for her heart to get her on a transplant list, she's joined by Ben at the airport, who decides to come with her.Jonathan Castellanos as Charlie -- When Charlie was 9, his parents abandoned him. He now works at the clinic, and "supposedly" lives in a hostel. It is shown that he actually house-sits condos for 6 months a year, and has a bed under a lab in the clinic as well. He is good friends with both Tommy and Cole. Charlie has a crush on Brenner and was worried that she didn't know his name. Charlie has given voice to the titles of episode 3 and 4.From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia since Amazon gives No Description! </p>

 <p> Why does ABC always seem to cancel the shows that really could be GREAT?  This show is one of them!  It had really interesting characters, and of course a fantastic locale. I always waited with great antiscipation for Wednesday nights. I'm with the others, I will buy the DVD and watch it over and over. ABC really blew it on this one. </p>

 <p> From the creators of "Grey's Anatomy" comes a new medical series titled "Off the Map".The 13-episode series aired on ABC from Jan. through April 2011 and revolves around seven doctors who work in a remote South American village.

Dr. Brenner is determined to become a doctor after the death of her fiance, Dr. Fuller is a young doctor who barely graduated from medical school and shunned his family and Dr. Minard, who lost confidence in herself after a misdiagnosis killed a patient.For each of these seven doctors, life in the remote village is a second chance at life but also a chance to become a doctor and help the less fortunate"Off the Map" is filmed in the same location of the series "LOST" (in O'ahu, Hawaii) and unfortunately, the series lasted for one season before being canceled by ABC.Here is a spoiler-less summary of the 13 episodes of the series:DISC 1:EPISODE 1 - Saved By the Great White Hope - Doctors of a remote clinic in South America welcome three young doctors.

Dr. Minard and Dr. Cole try to help a patient who was electrocuted.EPISODE 4 - On the Mean Streets of San Miguel - Lily, Ben and Charlie need to get medication in San Miguel, meanwhile the doctors must treat an older man who they find out is a former Nazi hiding out in the village.DISC 2:EPISODE 5- I'm Here - When a man and his daughter are caught in a rockslide, the doctors must go to on a rescue mission in the sea.

Lily has a problem with Mateo's family because they are cocaine farmers.EPISODE 13 - There's A Lot to Mess About the Jungle - Tommy is back and he has a big surprise for the family and in other good news, Sarah announces her wedding date.VIDEO & AUDIO:"Off the Map: The Complete Series" is featured in Widescreen (1:78:1), enhanced for 169 televisions. For a TV series, "Off the Map" has a similarity to a series like "LOST" because they are both filmed in Oahu, Hawaii.Because so much of the series is shot outdoors, "Off the Map" definitely looks beautiful!  The location shots look very good and you know that it would even look better if this series was released on Blu-ray, but on DVD, picture quality is very good.As for audio, "Off the Map: The Complete Series" is featured in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, the show is mostly dialogue-based but there are quite a bit of action sequences and you can hear the ambiance of the environment through the surround channels.  Granted, it's not very active soundtrack but its still better than most drama television series.Subtitles are in English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES:"Off the Map: The Complete Series" comes with the following special features:DISC 3:On Set at Off the Map - (8:18) The producers and cast talk about how unique "Off the Map" is from other medical drama series because of its use of action.  Also, how the more difficult scenes of various episodes were shot.Jungle Medicine - (4:53) Jenna Bans talk about the medicine used in the remote jungle and the research that went into the medicine used for the series.Deleted Scenes - A total of eleven deleted scenes.Bloopers - (2:14) Outtakes from "Off the Map".EXTRAS:"Off the Map: The Complete Series" comes with a slip over case.JUDGMENT CALL:When it comes to medical dramas, Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers definitely know what they are doing.  Having two shows on ABC, "Grey's Anatomy" and "Private Practice", the duo have joined executive producer Jenna Bans to create another medical drama titled "Off the Map", but in this case, making the series different by incorporating action/adventure together with medicine.While the series manages to capture the elements of different medical emergencies and issues with each episode, especially from a remote area near the jungles and ocean in the middle of nowhere, I think that perhaps too many medical dramas on a network can be difficult.We have seen it in the past when there are far too many police series, too many investigative series and too many law series and they don't last.With two medical series, I felt that people weren't ready to watch a third and that is rather unfortunate because "Off the Map" is a pretty unique medical series because it doesn't take place in a metropolitan series and I found some of the medical emergencies to be quite intriguing.Granted, I don't know how farfetched the storylines are, for example, in one episode, a green anaconda nearly crushes a photographer and the doctors try to rescue him.  And of course, you have rockslide, mines trapping people looking for gold and it's a different type of series that you just don't see on television.  But at the same time, I have heard from actual doctors working in remote villages that the series is extremely romanticized for entertainment and people who were disappointed by how unrealistic the portrayal was.As for the characters, it's a different dynamic once again compared to "Grey's Anatomy" and "Private Practice", where in those episode...it's always emergency issues and main characters constantly sleeping with each other.  While you see a little of that in this series, the sex doesn't dominate the series and for me, that is a positive!While the location of the series definitely has many beautiful scenes (once I saw the rock formation and blue ocean, I knew that it was shot in Hawaii where "Lost" was filmed), the show has episodes that were overly predictable but then again, many other top medical dramas have had their share of predictable storylines as well.Overall, I actually enjoyed "Off the Map" because although a medical drama series, it had that action/adventure element incorporated to it which made it a bit more exciting.  It's sad that the series was canceled but at the same time, you could only have so many medical drama series on television and perhaps it was a bit much for viewers.But I suppose if one is looking for a different kind of medical series that are only 13-episodes long, "Off the Map: The Complete Series" is a series worth checking out! </p>

 <p> Poor Caroline Dhavernas, she's so underrated, and is involved in such great work. For those of you who don't know who she is, she played Dr. Lily Brenner, and is most well known for yet another short lived show: Wonderfalls. For those of you who don't know what that is, go check it out, now- I'll wait. Saw it, great, isn't it? But, alas, it only lasted four episodes (the other 9 were released with the 4 on DVD). This was the reason I started watching "Off The Map." I'm not a medical drama person, so the Shonda Rhimes credit didn't mean much to me, it was Caroline that pulled me in, and boy was I glad she did.From first glance, "Off the Map" is your typical Medical Drama, but that's when the old adage, "don't judge a book by its cover" comes into play. "Off the Map," for me, is "Pushing Daisies" in its own right. Now, don't get me wrong, nothing like "Daisies" will ever come along again, (if you haven't seen Pushing Daisies, go check it out, now- again, I'll wait, I've got all the time in the world) but "Off the Map" shares a similarity in its uniqueness.Each Episode is packed with interesting tragedy, accidents, and relationships. The same equation we all know and love. But, here's were the uniqueness comes into play, its set in a third world South America country. Each episode chronicles the hard work of several American doctors in the area's only Clinic, and possibly the country's only advanced clinic. Note, that these are American doctors, who all share their own back story, the reason they were brought here, but again, American doctors, who don't speak Spanish, or understand the culture in which these people live. More difficulties arrive when the revelation that the many patients in the clinic object to medicine, do not trust these doctors, and do not trust their prognosis."Off the Map" was a brilliant show marketed has a medical drama, but is so much more. It's also a message, that in tough, unsure times, where we live in a turbulent economy, it is often easy to pity ourselves, but this show throws people who come from similar situations, into a situation that presents cultural, lingual, and religious barriers, and shows that while we can pity ourselves, there are other people out there who are in even worse situations. I write this, trying to avoid getting very preachy. And if you choose to ignore the message in this cancelled too soon show, you'll enjoy it just the same, its that good of a series. </p>

 <p> My only question is why was this series ever cancelled, it's so good. I missed the first epiosode so I never watched the show. I had heard from so many people how good it was. So I had to order it and see for myself. They were right it is an amazing series. I just don't understand the canceling of programs on TV now days. I really enjoyed the romance and the interaction of the actors on this series. I simply wanted more. </p>

 <p> so you think i,m jaded by my comment i could of used wheres the fire as there are many to put out in many different  ways for drama  but this short lived masterpiece was sheer genius to have not renewed this gem was even more so to have renewed it  would have been a barnburner because this could only work once strike the kettle while it was still hot if you want what i feel could have been the forerunner called lost in the wild very close to the same premise </p>
