 <p> Works well as a replacement for a defective battery I had in a refurbished Uniden phone.  My original battery would  only last 30 minutes or so.  I have not had this one even drop one tic on the battery indicator after more than an hour. </p>

 <p> I bought these to replace the non working batteries in a phone I bought from a 3rd party Amazon seller. One of the batteries isn't holding a charge as it should.For the price I supose I got what I paid for. That's the risk on these 3rd party sellers. More folks should send in reviews. I rely on them for purchases.I wouldn't recommend this seller. </p>

 <p> 3 phones that wouldn't hold a charge, until I purchased these.  Now each phone in any given room works and doesn't die as soon as I answer it.  Much cheaper than replacing the phones! </p>

 <p> These work great I ordered 2. One phone had died and we have 2 matching handsets. I figured there is a good chance the stock battery will die in the future on the working handset so I wanted a back up. what else can I say it saved me from having to spend 50-60 bucks on a new phone system for the house. They also had a small charge in them so I was able to test them as soon as they arrived. </p>

 <p> It Fits!!! </p>

 <p> I purchased a replacement battery from another dealer which was said to be for the Uniden DECT 6.0. The battery connector plug would not fit the port. Time and money wasted.I then ordered another battery from EZFindDeals. The battery arrived on the first day of the estimated delivery period. There is a note on the battery to charge it for 16 hours before using. I will do that. First though, I did check to see if the battery connector plug would fit. It does fit, and the instant I plugged it in, the phone lit up ready for use. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Works right away </p>

 <p> Timely shipping and arrived with no issues.  This is an exact fit for my Uniden Dect 6.0.  Had phones in storage for a year and when pulled them out all the batteries were dead.  These replacement batteries solved the problem and now they work like new. </p>

 <p> This review is being written 12/2/2012 for Uniden BT1021 Cordless Phone Battery 2.4 Volt, Ni-MH 750mAh - Replacement fo UNIDEN BT-1008, BT-1016, sold by third party vendors who advertise on the Amazon website.This battery replaced the OEM unit in the Uniden phone OK.  It contains two AAA batteries connected together and surrounded by an outer jacket.  Its performance is rather weak, but that is more the fault of the phone design and decision to use AAA's to save weight and cost vs. AA's which last longer and are used in some other Uniden phones.  Even with the so-called power-saving design on the newer Uniden phones, the AA-designed units last longer between charges for me.Overall, I'd recommend this product as long as the price is cheap. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Worked right out of the box ! </p>
