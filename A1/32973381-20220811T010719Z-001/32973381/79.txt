<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Perfect </p>

 <p> Originally purchased for a 14" Samsung laptop (QX410-S02), I've had this sleeve for about a year now. High quality, great look, snug fit for my laptop with my logitech unifying dongle slightly jutting out - just all around perfect for my needs. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> A Magnet? </p>

 <p> There is a magnet which holds the flap in place. Not sure if you want to use that next to your laptop's hard drive. Unless of course, you have a SSD in your laptop. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Well Made Laptop Sleeve </p>

 <p> This Toshiba laptop sleeve will protect other laptops/notebooks of its screen size (!4 inch) quite well. I have been using with my Dell Inspiron 13z and have found it to offer better cushioning than the neoprene 13.3 inch sleeve that I had purchased for it. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Missing something to be great </p>

 <p> I bought this sleeve for my 13" Macbook Pro. It fits generously. I can even throw my iPad 2 in. It is a sleeve, you cant put charger or anything that thick in. Very convenient to carry from office to library. Fit well in my 15" backpack. The magnetic lock is useful. I like it so far. </p>

 <p> The sleeve fit my toshiba 14 inch laptop perfectly.  It protectsit fairly well.  Not the best one I've seen but for the priceit was a good deal. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> I got it for free so a normal Sleeve is great. </p>

 <p> I got it for free, even son the quality is naice and it makes its job but it is not a premium product i think </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Wish it was less bulky and has pocket for ac adapter </p>

 <p> Wish it was less bulky and heavy, had a pocket for ac adapter. Otherwise, it's fine.Presario CQ43 fits in nicely, so HP owners can also buy this one safely. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> delicate but a bit tight for my dell xps 14 </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> good choice for business occasion. Delicately made. But I think it is more fit for laptops of business use such as thinkpad T4xx,or Dell latitude 54/64xx. As to my dell XPS 14, it is a bit tight.You don't have to care that this case is made for toshiba because the trademake of toshiba on the case is quite small and dark. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> 14inch case? </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This is a little too big for my 14" Toshiba M645 and too small if I have the 12-cell il-ion battery pack on the laptop.  Other than it not fitting properly, it seems to be made very well for the $5 I paid for it.  Item was in its own plastic bag in the Amazon box with a few other items.  Only 3 stars for it being too big for my Toshiba 14inch laptop, then too small for it with the 12-cell battery. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Nice fit and good quality </p>

 <p> I wasn't sure it was going to fit since I have an HP Folio and not a Toshiba.  But it fit perfectly, snug but not tight.  And it has a very professional look to it.  It makes a nice and business-friendly way to carry my laptop to meetings, etc.  It also goes smoothly through TSA security without removing the laptop.  Arrived promptly and priced right.  I am very glad I got this instead of a neoprene zippered sleeve. </p>
