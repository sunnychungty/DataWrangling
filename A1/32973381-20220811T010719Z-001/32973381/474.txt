 <p> A World War II novel about an intelligence operation in the African desert that grows in an unlikely manner.  If you or an agnostic or atheist, you might not enjoy this interesting story because of the strong religious preferences of one of the main characters.  This is a fast read that you won't want to put down. </p>

 <p> There were many positives as well as negatives about this book.Positives:1) The story's plot was interesting. You wanted to know what was going to happen. Really wanted to know.2) The fight scenes were engaging and descriptive, unlike some books I could mention... it seemed to describe real action.3) The historical blended well with the fictional aspect and made things intriguing. I felt like I learned things I didn't know before about that section of the war.4) It was nice to have Christian values and concepts brought into a novel.Negatives:1) The plot felt forced in quite a few areas. Why did Dane make a troublemaker Russian stay with them. There was no &#34;have to&#34; here.. it felt like it was contrived to give tension to the book, not like it was something that could be avoided.2) While the actions were realistic, the emotional aspect was shallow. It felt like all the characters said and did what the author wanted them to.... like they were puppets on a string being jerked around this way and that for the story's sake... like it wasn't really them, just emotions pasted onto cardboard figures. It felt fake, fake, fake.3) I really didn't care for the amount of lust and leering and graphic descriptions of the russian mistreating the main girl character. I felt like that was thrown in for ... modernity's sake? It would have been better without all that... or only 5% of it.4) While I appreciated the Christian concepts discussed and the gospel presentation, this also felt like it was slapped on and shallow. Don't get me wrong, I am a Christian and hold dearly to my beliefs, but this came across like the author thought &#34;Oh, right, need to make them believe certain ways by the end of the story&#34;.... slap on shallow corny conversation .... I felt like ... the &#34;converts&#34; fell for everything too quickly and did &#34;what they were supposed to&#34; without seeing a deep change... just switching out the &#34;unsaved&#34; for &#34;saved&#34; sign hanging around their neck.  And it was a little much to have us see the Russian in hell, screaming for all of eternity.....So, to sum it up, the plot is interesting and informative, but the character's are shallow - emotionally and spiritually. This could be a really good book - after it was edited and tightened up a couple notches. </p>

 <p> Dane Shaw rhymes with Dwayne Straw, a very well written war story. I am sure a lot of  soldiers received God as their savior, that also was well presented. I intend to read the sequel. </p>

 <p> Good </p>

 <p> Those brave men that risked their lives to defeat the delusional Germans are well represented by the two leading characters with an innocent woman trapped in the winds of war;  Though I understand the religious fervor of the author  I found the religious passages a little bit over used. In all,  the novel was engrossing  and well paced. Conrad </p>

 <p> However when I got to the part about a romantic rivalry between an officer and an enlisted man over a woman they just met while on a covert operation behind enemy lines I couldn't read any further.  When I have read all of the material tht is available free on Amazon, I might get back to it. </p>

Great action that I could actually envisage due to the authors descriptions. Looking for more by this author.Would definitely recommend to my friends. </p>

 <p> Great adventure story with just a touch of romance! This is written from a Christian viewpoint and the hero is not only resourceful and brave but he relies on The Lord for wisdom and help in time of need. I really enjoyed reading this! </p>
