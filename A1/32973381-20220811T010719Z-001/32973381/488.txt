 <p> What made this story charming was the Britishness of it. I'm an American and reading this with the delightful Use of the Queen's English made me smile. Just reading that a baby outfit is a baby grow made me wish to use that.While the plot is rather contrived and does go on a bit on details, but for an easy read without any depressing scenes nor violent language or sex or gore, this is perfect. </p>

 <p> Again, this was a free book that I picked out on the free pages.The beginning chapter or two may have been a bit slow, or it may just have taken me a bit of time to get use to the differences in United Kingdom English vs. American English. The book is well written and the character's are all unique, sometimes downright crazy. Lois and to a lesser extent her boyfriend/fiancee/husband Tom are the main characters. At the beginning of the story they have bought a home not too far out of London, but in a country setting. Upon receiving the key, Lois proceeds to the house, only to find that the relatives of the former owners have literally stripped the place of everything movable. However, Lois seems to handle e each crisis, including neighbors who i fight so loud, it can be heard in their house next door and another who stops by to give them a list of "rules" however all is not as I it first seems.As they get to know their neighbors, there little enclave, former homes of servants from the neighboring manor, they new adventures, interesting friends and a new way of life. This is a feel good book and I have to admit that I laughed and cried at the appropriate places. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read. </p>

 <p> I think this book could have been a short story instead.  It took forever to get that baby here!  I like a few more twists and turns to a book -- more complexity.  This is a nice sweet tale though. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> A little slow </p>

 <p> Really great, easy book. I hope there will be a sequel. I am sure there are more tales to tell of the quirky inhabitants of the village. </p>

 <p> Nice story about being pregnant while renovating a house in the countryside of England and planning a wedding. I enjoy the English sense of humor and the writing style of many writers from &#34;across the pond&#34;; this book fit the bill wonderfully. Not overly burdened with details of the renovation, but a pleasant blend of all the elements of its story. Of course there's one grouchy old neighbor, but he doesn't figure too heavily either- just enough. All together a great evening/beach read, well worth the time and money. </p>

 <p> A light and enjoyable read though a bit predictable in places.  The characters were charming as far as they went, it almost seemed an introduction to more stories to come perhaps.  At times there were so many neighbors introduced in a short span, it was difficult to remember who was who.  Good summer read! </p>

 <p> What looked like an interesting book at first turned me off within the first 3 pages or so. The first curse word printed was the &#34;F&#34;-word, and I stopped reading it there. Why do authors think that they need to include foul language to get readers? I, for one, am not interested in reading this language, especially since I am constantly bombarded with it whenever I go out to a public place. I will NOT attempt to read anything by this author again! </p>

 <p> Foul language inside!! </p>
