<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> Once when I was on an overseas tour, the guide looked me in the eye and bluntly claimed, "Americans are FAT."  She had a point there because as Tom and Dian Giesel say, "we live in a society where we are quite literally eating ourselves to death."  There are a plethora of diet books out there, most of which seem to make their way into library sales for obvious reasons.  Most of them simply do not work for the average person, a person who is not committed to changing their lifestyle.  Simply reading a book will not make one thin or fit.  The Giesels maintain that they will "give you all the information and know-how you will need to lose not weight--which is comprised of water, bones, fat and essential organs and tissues--but excess body fat, the only thing you want to lose."  (p. xviii).  The enthusiastic introduction, which does read like an informercial, certainly garnered my attention.TurboCharged is a "holistic process" presented in eight simple steps.  The emphasis of TurboCharging is to lose body fat by starving "our bodies of those foods that trigger insulin release." (p. 7)  If you are certain you want to explore the contents of this book and are going to purchase it, feel free to bypass this review.  If you'd like to know what is actually in the book, keep on reading.  I'll try to give a brief summation of the steps, without going into excessive detail ... that is the job the Griesels will do for you.Step #1:  "Forget What You've Been Told About Dieting."  This step discusses common myths that prevent us from losing weight, the things most diets have in common, how you can eat nourishing foods without going into starvation mode, and how you will find "the perfect way to eat for the rest of your life.Step #2:  `Measure REAL Success."  Because you will be aiming to lose body fat and reduce your body-fat percentage, you will learn what percentage you'll need to aim for and when to weigh yourself.  There is a link given where you can find a free body-fat calculator, but later in the book there was a recommendation that one might wish to purchase a Tanita scale.  Essentially, "The greater your actual fat loss, the greater the waist-measurement reduction."Step #3:  "The Fat-Burning Elixir."  This step gives some of the key ingredients, so to speak, of TurboCharging.  You will learn how to differentiate between hunger and appetite and how to curb unnecessary eating or bingeing.  For example, one suggestion is that "maximum hydration, primarily with water, and secondarily with other zero-calorie drinks, is essential to triggering the release of hormones that results in the sensation of satiety or satisfaction with lower food intake."  (p. 26)  Other instructions and suggestions of what to eat and not to eat are included.Step #4:  "Fresh Breath Never Tasted So Good."  No spoilers here, but this is an interesting little step three benefits that will "help dull taste buds" and keep you from thinking you "need" to eat.  It "helps get your thinking back in line ...helps you get refocused, and is of great assistance in eliminating mindless eating."  (p. 34)Step #5:  "Turbo-Charge Your Fat-Burning Metabolism With Activity."  The Griesels disagree with the "30 to 90 minutes of aerobic exercise three to five times a week with several strength training sessions."  (p. 37)  They do agree that activity is essential will help you calculate your energy requirements levels.  You'll read about a more sensible approach to exercise, how to calculate calories burned (a chart is provided), you learn several TurboCharged walking tips, and how you can help your body become a "superior fat-burning machine."Step #6:  "Muscle Power in 5 ... (Minutes a Day!)  Additional tips are given so you can "get your body to use excess fat as its preferred energy source."  (p. 57)  There hare reminders about differentiating hunger and thirst and you'll be given some basic dumbbell routines to follow.Step #7:  "Eating to TurboCharge."  After a brief review of the significant concepts already covered, you'll learn about different types of meals and "nutrient separation."  You'll also learn about what NOT to eat when you are TurboCharging.  One standout line was that you "do not eat refined foods in any form and [you should] drive right by any and all grain products."  You'll also learn about vitamins, foods that will work for you, and you'll read brief portraits of how Tom and Dian both approach TurboCharging.Step #8:  "Seeing the Prize."  The title of this step is almost self-explanatory.  You'll be encouraged to see yourself as you want to be in the future, not as you were yesterday or what you see in the mirror today.Throughout the pages of this book there are several vignettes of people who have successfully incorporated TurboCharging into their lives.  Jerry claims that "This program is not about perfection, it's about achieving an intelligent balance so that you eat more and move to look and feel your best and do not feel deprived."  (p. 52)  Not everyone will be able to meet the demands of this program, yet it may encourage many to make changes in attitude or what they put on their plates.  This book does use calorie restriction ... "300 - 800 calories a day" and discusses very low-calorie diets (VLCD), essentially what you may initially be doing.The Griesels sensibly encourage a physical workup with your physician.  There is a question and answer portion in the back of the book that did address many of the questions I had as I read the book.  For example, they answer question like "Any tips for managing stress and mindless eating?"  There is a lengthy list of additional reference materials that were referred to in the course of the preparation of TurboCharged, some of which you may wish to explore.  I'm not in agreement with everything in this book, nor will everyone.  This is a program in which you will be requested to make lifestyle changes, something that only you can do.This book courtesy of the publisher. </p>

 <p> Turbo Charged- Accelerate Your Fat Burning MetabolismBy Dian Griesel PhD et al. 2010Reviewed By: Dr. Joseph S. MarescaThe book is dedicated to the memory of Jack La Lanne(1914- 2011). "What does age mean? Not being able todo the things you used to do. If I can get youdoing things you haven't done for years, isn't thatexciting? "There are a number of myths with regard to eating. Examples are:o weight loss = fat losso Eat a big breakfast at the start of each day .o Grains are necessary to a balanced diet .The author claims the following:"Three days is all it will take to start your body andspirit racing toward a lifetime of lean. Within 10 daysor less, you will be convinced. There are no gimmicks,supplements or special ingredients required."The website [...] provides a barometeron your current body composition. In men, a 1 inch decreasein weight accompanies a 5-7 pound loss.Tanita makes a good body fat scale at a $99. price.Appetite is a memory or a desire to eat.Unbeknownst to most people, the averageperson can live 40 days without food before causingserious damage to the body.Water intake lowers the body response to sugar ingested,improves insulin sensitivity and promotes fat burningfor energy. Testosterone increases with increasedwater consumption, metabolism increases and joints arelubricated creating super-immunity along with allergyelimination, reduction in colds and flu. The reasonfor these phenomena is that the body cannotfight disease when it is overburdened with waste.The author recommends to fill up on water insteadof food. Drink 2-3 glasses of water when youwake up in the morning. Also, drink water beforeany meal. Walking outdoors burns 6 calories perminute or 360 calories per hour. These statementsare true within my own domain of experience.By definition, a calorie is the amount ofheat required at a pressure of 1 atmosphere toraise the temperature of 1 gram of water a full1 degree centigrade. The Omron Walking StylePedometer costs about $30. The device measurestotal strides, distances and caloriesburned. Excess body fat is the preferred source ofenergy.To turbocharge your system, eat 90% whole protein and10% veggies or 90% veggies and 10% whole protein. Moreturbocharging combinations are set forth in the book.Grains are processed food with low water content andlow essential vitamins and micro-nutrients. Samples ofTurbo-charged meals are apples , anchovies, deli-turkey,apricots and artichokes.Supplemental reading to this book includes:o Orthopathy by Herbert Sheltono Revitalize Your Life After 50 by Jack LaLanneo The Paleo Diet by Dr. Loren Cordaino The Warrior Diet by Ori Hofmeklero Good Calories Bad Calories by Gary Taubeso Neanderthin by Audette and Gilchristo Conscious Eating by Gabriel Cousens MDo Toxemia by John Tildeno Sweet Suicide by Gene Wrighto Protein Power by Eades and much moreOverall, the book is a fair value for theprice charged. Learn a lot more about theconsequences of food choices and perhapslose weight in the process. Most importantly,regardless of what the authors say or claim,discuss your diet and exercise protocolswith the family personal physician and/orlicensed physical therapist.The authors do not discuss colonics at length;however,colonics does help to dischargewaste expeditiously in my own experience.Generally, people engage Certified ColonicsSpecialists to discharge toxins from the system.This discharge allows the body to heal fromunhealthy levels of toxin accumulation -sometimes over a lifetime .It is not uncommon for patients to lose10 pounds or more of waste in just a fewcolonics sessions. There are downsideswhich should be discussed with your medicalcare provider.Proponents of colon cleansing, on the other hand,believe that toxins from your gastrointestinaltract can cause a variety of health problems, such as arthritis, allergies and asthma. They believe that colon cleansing -also called a colonic or a colonic irrigation - improves health by removing toxins, promoting healthy intestinal bacteria, boosting your energy and enhancingthe immune system. Colon cleansing is also promotedas a treatment for cancer and numerous otherconditions. 1)1) [...] </p>

 <p> It is not often that a book about dieting and physical workout instructions and good/bad foods captures not only the attention of the reader but also creates a credible enthusiasm that makes the reader plow through the book in a single setting. But that is exactly what Dian and Tom Griesel have created in their eminently readable, rational, realistic and exciting book TURBOCHARGED.  The only question left at book's end is why hasn't someone been this helpful before?This book lays to rest many of the outmoded truisms about weight control.  Without being hypercritical the authors merely explain in lay terms the concept of metabolism, the definition of hunger as thirst, and the misconception that 'weight loss' is a tough fad-like plan (one that soon fatigues the temporary devotee and recycles the weight gain problem 10 fold!).  Avoiding medical shoptalk these writers go to the point - re-teaching your brain to recognize satiety based on the simple frequent intake of water, eating only healthy foods (very beautifully outlined in an understandable way here), substituting very easy and quick periodic exercises for the expensive home gym or gym membership.  In other words, becoming lean is quick and easy and takes only steady commitment on our part to tending to our body and achieve goals few of us thought possible.There are very few body improvement books that can be recommended more highly than TURBOCHARGED.  Even reading the book is addictive and to say much more about the book would be a disservice to those out there who are frustrated with fatty deposits in their bodies.  Buy your own copy, keep our own copy for reference, and encourage your acquaintances with healthy outlooks who are struggling with expensive diets and special meals and memberships in programs to buy it too.  This book works!  Grady Harp, April 11 </p>

 <p> I'm approaching 70 years old, and I've been overweight since my mid-teenage years. I've tried a number of weight loss plans and had success, but the pounds always returned. Last year, I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, which has motivated me more than any other factor to lose weight and live a healthier life. When the author emailed me to request a review of "TurboCharged," I was happy to oblige.The author claims that the TurboCharged program will outperform any other diet or exercise plan. The theory behind the TurboCharged program is that by burning body fat for energy instead of burning muscle cells, weight loss will occur by removing excess body fat.Some of the requirements for TurboCharged weren't surprising, such as eliminating refined sugar and reducing or eliminating grain products. I've seen that in other nutrition books. Some of the steps, however, were unique, at least to me, such as drinking water a couple of glasses at a time, instead of sipping water constantly. The theory behind this seemed reasonable.One concept that was new to me was measuring your success not by pounds lost or BMI, but by percent of body fat. The book has a link to an online body fat calculator. I input my numbers and as expected, my body fat percentage is too high.Exercise was another topic. TurboCharged emphasizes regular physical activity in lieu of bursts of intense exercise. This more closely emulates how our ancestors lived before the mechanized age.Finally, the book covers some ideal foods for TurboCharging your body. Interestingly, it also emphasized which foods should be eaten together for optimum digestion, and it actually discouraged eating balanced meals.There's a 33-page Q&A; section that should answer most questions, plus an extensive supplemental reading list.I mentioned that I'm a diabetic. When I began reading the book, I was concerned that it might overlook the effects of the program on diabetes, but every chapter included information about the impacts on glucose and insulin levels.The TurboCharged program was presented with a mix of theory and practical advice. In my opinion, the author made a strong case for TurboCharged. For many people, going on the program would require significant lifestyle changes. I'm not sure if I could make these changes at my age, but it's worth considering for anyone who wants to be healthier. </p>

 <p> This book works!  Follow the simple directions and you WILL reduce your body fat, save your lean muscle, and lose weight.  Plus, you'll never be hungry and you'll have all the good food you want.  Who can ask for more?!  Having been on the "diet" for 7 weeks, I've lost 12 pounds, lost 12% body fat, and many inches.  And I know several other people who have used the TurboCharged method and lost many pounds and inches.  I don't care for diet fads and have never tried a diet before, but when age began adding a few pounds a year despite my working out, hiking, and cutting down portion sizes, I decided something had to be done.  When I saw the results friends were getting with TurboCharged, I decided to try it and have been pleasantly surprised to see the fat rolls start disappearing (yes, visibly)!  I have more to go, but have no doubt that I'll be back down to 130 pounds and minimal body fat in another 7 weeks.  Tom & Dian explain what needs to be done, why, and how to do it in simple, clear language.  I'd recommend this book and method to any friend. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> This intense, aggressive health regimen isn't so much a diet or weight loss plan, as a lifestyle intended to increase health and wellness.  Its step-by-step approach increases the likelihood that new adopters can keep up, and it doesn't require elaborate supplements or other pricy additions.  By focusing not on weight, but on body fat content, the authors create a comprehensible approach anyone can follow with only moderate effort.But the authors take pride in rejecting the established wisdom.  They have no use for systematic exercise, conventional hydration, or grains.  That last wanders perilously close to the Atkins Diet, which is known to have serious negative side effects.  Since the authors cite no sources for their unconventional approach, I can't comfortably take on their entire program.  I can only pick and choose the portions I consider most defensible.This book has its points, particularly its refusal to indulge in talky jargon or pseudoscience.  But it ventures into weird territory without telling us how they came up with their ideas, which gives me the willies.  This may give you good ideas to cherry-pick for your own weight loss regime, I strongly recommend against accepting this process altogether without consulting your doctor or other professional.  It's just too experimental for me. </p>

 <p> This book works like nothing else I have ever done in my life, and now that I am 50, the things I had done in the past to get the weight off were not working.  It took me 2 months to lose 8 pounds "the old way". I've lost twice that in three weeks.  But that's not the best part.  The energy that I now have is phenomenal!  I am only halfway to my goal, and I've been thinner than I am now.  It's not the weight loss itself that gave me that energy, but of course it didn't hurt.  The difference is that I now shop the outer edge of the grocery store and stay away from processed foods.  There's more to it than that.  You really need to read and re-read the entire book.  I've actually purchased 4 copies so far to give to family and friends.  It only took two days to convince me that this is the way I will eat for the rest of my life.  I no longer have the aches and pains that I really thought were just a part of being 50.  You owe it to yourself to at least download a sample of the electronic version.  Even if you don't have fat to lose, if you no longer feel as good as you did when you were younger, or if you are like me and never felt healthy, this book can help you. </p>

 <p> As a reviewer, I get certain genre(s) in cycles.  Right now I am in the Health/Weight Loss genre cycle.In the past 4 months, I've read 4 books on these subjects.  One was actually more about mental health but physical health plays a role in that area, so the book reached out in that directions too.But TurboCharged by siblings Dian Griesel, Ph.D. and Tom Griesel is one I would call a stand out.  In the introduction, the first statement is very bold, "The TurboCharged steps as presented in this book will out-perform any other diet or exercise program you may have tried in the past."  I like bold statements like that.Every paragraph provides another piece to the puzzle, without overwhelming you with facts.  As explained, all of the information makes perfect sense.  The only "trick"?  You have to work the steps.One point discussed focused on water consumption.  I've always been a sipper.  I carry my glass and plastic straw around all day, sipping.  TurboCharged explains why this is not enough to handle how much water my body really needs.  It took me a few days to get into the habit of drinking more each time I picked up my glass and after having tried the TurboCharged way for one week; I experienced quite a few changes.Two other chapters I found to be worthy of a book alone, were #6 Muscle Power in 5...Minutes a Day! and the 100 calorie and under list in chapter #7.  I'm thinking a poster of each of these chapters would be great.  Lots of information at one glance.Another great chapter, #8 "See" the Prize.  I am a firm believer in visualization and meditation.  Here Dian and Tom discuss the importance of relaxing our minds and how doing so positively affects the body and our quest to be healthy.I think that's the main point here.  If we want to be healthy, it takes effort.  Start by making the effort to read this book. </p>

 <p> I read this book twice. On the first read through I disagreed with the authors on many things. Some of the advice seems to go against popular diet advice. But when I read the book again I realized that the authors are promoting three different diets and one is very low calorie. They call this "enlightened fasting" and you consume only 300-800 calories a day. On one of the diets you also don't eat breakfast - something other diets recommend you do to lose weight. That seemed a bit extreme to me.Also in many places throughout the book the authors state that you never need to count calories and can eat as much as you want of TurboCharged foods. The authors also caution against eating balanced meals and are against eating grains. They promote a different way of eating. Either you eat lots of veggies and fruit and a little protein meal or you eat 90 percent protein and 10 percent veggies or fruit. Also they say you can have as much fruit as you want since it is hard to overeat fruit. Many diets say to only eat about two pieces of fruit a day. So this is a little confusing.Basically what this diet does is it starves the body of foods that cause a high insulin release.On this diet you need to drink a ton of water. I found that I don't actually like drinking too much water at a meal - one glass is enough for me. Also you should know that drinking too much water too quickly can kill you. The authors give amounts of water (1 quart four times a day) you should drink at various times during the day and claim this is safe.While reading this book I took notes on all the things you can not eat on this diet. Basically you will be avoiding all sugars, grains, refined foods, dried fruit, milk, honey, cookies, cakes, donuts, sports drinks, popcorn, candy and nuts. You also can't eat fats with carbohydrates or protein with carbohydrates. Also they recommend you not eat fruit with high fat foods like cheese.So is there an exercise program with this diet? There are some short routines for muscle building but the main recommendation is to walk 10,000 steps a day. This will probably help anyone lose weight. I noticed that when I became more active I did lose weight.I am not following the diet fully yet as I'm easing into it but already I've lost four pounds. I've also been making some recipes from the TurboCharged cookbook which were really good. I highly recommend the chocolate peanut truffles, although they do have agave in them.I think if you increase your activity level and eat moderately this diet could work for you. It is not complicated once you write everything down. I suggest you read this book at least twice before following the advice.~The Rebecca ReviewI received a free copy of this book for review. </p>

 <p> TurboCharged is unique among the various diet books I've seen.  In a very engaging style, the authors make it clear that we can reduce our body fat by burning the fat as fuel, and also actually reduce our metabolic age if we follow the eight steps they outline.  I was amazed to learn how conventional diet and exercise can keep us fat--and equally surprised that it's possible to develop lean body mass with such a small time commitment per day.  Both authors used this plan to get to their current weight.  I highly recommend this book. </p>

 <p> I don't think that this book qualifies as a diet book per se. The authors present their philosophy or method toward weight loss. They do present dietary guidelines, but insist that they don't focus on caloric restrictions and exercise regimes. Their approach incorporates eight steps to achieving weight loss and boosting the metabolism or "turbocharging" the body.I have problems with this approach for numerous reasons. First the author's presume that everyone that is obese or overweight is eating as much as 3500 calories each day. Second they state that anyone can do their program even those that are bedridden. I know many overweight people that consume less than 1800 calories each day (possibly eating the wrong things but definitely not more than 2000 calories) and they aren't losing the weight. Since one of their eight steps includes daily mini-activity sessions (i.e., exercise) that are based on lunges, body weight squats, standing heel raises, etc., I don't see how people that are either paraplegics or bedridden could possibly commit to this system. In addition, the authors state that this isn't based on calories and one need not count calories but the book later states that you'll need to consume 300-800 calories on the "expressway days." This is definitely caloric restriction.This book is written in a way to attract and keep the reader's attention. It is definitely written in a way that is easy to understand. I don't necessarily disagree with many of the premises that the authors put forth in this book. I just challenge the premise that it can and will work for everyone. I don't feel that any one diet will work for everyone (if there were only one then there would be no more need for books, gyms, etc.) but if this does, then great! For those people that can commit to the food restrictions (no grains or breakfast allowed), daily mini-activity sessions, and temporary caloric restriction days, then this may be the program for you. For the rest of us, this may not be the answer. </p>
