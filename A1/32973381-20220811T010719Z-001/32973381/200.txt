 <p> Like others I have several different versions of this classic but what I liked most about this production was its consistency- all the parts come together and integrate as a total satisfying package.The colour palette fits,the lighting is suitably moody,the costumes work (beautifully) while being rightly non-committal about the period of the piece and the characters are convincing.As the Artistic Director says in his interview,the strength of the Company is in its theatricality and this dvd shows that so well. As for the dancers,this version is a warm, human drama not over-emphasising technique for the sake of it- thus maintaining the illusion in persuading us that the situation is believable.If icy technique is for you try Letestu and the POB. For me there are two defining moments with Nordquist- the physical reaction in act 2 when she accepts that Siegfried truly loves her, and the flash of her eyes in act 3 when she first meets him as the Black Swan- both significant moments which define the character.Yes she is young (so?) but what ability! And her partner Nordstrom not only looks the part but dances so well,as do all the supporting cast,particularly Rothbart who is one of the best ever.Interesting that Peter Wright has referenced Star Wars in the final resolution which also is one of the best to be seen. Coherence at last !This is an excellent buy with unobtrusive camerawork and superb surround sound- it's the one I will be showing to the Grandchildren as a fine example of a deservedly famous ballet. </p>

 <p> I found a great deal to like about this *Swan Lake*. To those who found it emotionally uninvolving, I can only say that we just didn't see the same ballet! Nathalie Nordquist's facial expressions are marvelous examples of concise emotional communication. As Odette, she readily conveys innocence, vulnerability, and devotion. As Odile, she is all guile and flirtatiousness, with many a sidelong glance (even at Siegfried as she takes her bows in Act 3), sure of her seductive powers. And thank goodness, she doesn't look like a stick-woman: she has real arms! Of course, with her supernaturally fluid arm gyrations, Maya Plisetskaya absolutely *owns* Odette's exit from Act 2 (and a few other things as well!). But all in all, Nordquist is a fine swan in my book.The corps de ballet also presents some of the most exacting alignments I've ever seen. (Not even the two great Russian companies are this good, in person or on disc.) Time after time, the dancers align and realign as close to ruler-perfect as one could hope for. The company's acute spatial awareness thus allows us to enjoy the geometric design of the large-scale numbers without distraction. (The wing-formation of the introduction and the second act are stunningly exact, for instance. I don't think I've seen that formation anywhere else.) That's no mean feat. "Amateurs" do not perform at this level.I also loved the sumptuous sets and costumes, strongly keyed to black but in no way monotonous. If, as some have complained, you cannot see Rothbart against the dark background and blame it on poor lighting, you need to (1) adjust the settings on your equipment or (2) upgrade your player and/or monitor. Without any adjustment at all, my equipment showed Rothbart standing out clearly in every lighting condition, against even the darkest depths of the stage. So there is absolutely nothing wrong with this DVD's technical specs. They simply demand more than many systems can deliver.Given the dark setting, I'm glad to say that this production had the courage of its conceptions: no Soviet-style happy ending here. Siegfried and Odette both plunge to their deaths, leaving Benno to retrieve his beloved friend's body from the lake. Good show! *Swan Lake* was never meant to be a happy affair. It is naturally Gothic, like many unexpurgated Grimm's folktales.This production also deserves kudos for giving us just about all of Act 4 as Tchaikovsky wrote it (first time through, I detected the deletion of only a few measures at most). You'd think that Russian productions would do just as well, but I've seen the Bolshoi and the Kirov/Mariinsky productions in person, and both excise whole chunks of the score and interpolate other material that doesn't belong there at all (even if, as with the Kirov, it's Tchaikovsky piano music orchestrated by other hands [help!]). This is beyond ironic, since the Soviets presided over publication of the critical edition of all three ballets in the early 1950s! Alas, musicology never touched the toes of the traditional bowdlerization of this groundbreaking ballet, not even in Mother Russia.For those of us who know the complete score, it is simply appalling that no one has had the courage to rethink this great ballet from the perspective of what Tchaikovsky actually wrote. When is this score going to get the theatrical respect it deserves? I don't mind eliminating certain repetitions, but could some brave choreographer please give us this ballet with all the notes Piotr Ilyich wrote for it (preserving the best of what's already been choreographed, of course) -- and *in the order he prescribed*? Whole chunks of Act 3 actually belong in Act 1, for example. We have the original scenario, so there's already an "action plan" ready to implement.What are we losing in all the existing slice-and-dice stagings? Tchaikovsky's sense of pacing and his carefully calibrated key relationships (see vol. 2 of David Brown's biography, pp. 83-85). Tchaikovsky's ballets are great, in part, because they are symphonically conceived -- and that means that the individual numbers are *not* interchangeable, as all modern productions effectively presume. Who among us would not thrill to see an authentically complete *Swan Lake*? How can we make it happen?In the meantime, I expect to return to this production many times with great pleasure. </p>

 <p> I've seen several productions of "Swan Lake", and I have to say that this is far and away probably the best one around.  Peter Wright's updated staging takes the classic tale of love and magic and turns it into an exquisite Gothic tragedy.  The ballet opens with the funeral of Siegfried's father, a narrative touch overlooked in other stagings.  As the prince faces the twin impending dooms of kingship and marriage (as his mother tells him, "You WILL marry"), his friend Benno tries to cheer him up with wine, women, and dancing.  When that doesn't work, they decide, in classic male fashion, to go shoot something with Siegfried's new crossbow.  The rest of the story proceeds along familiar lines: the meeting of Siegfried and the enchanted swan-princess Odette, Siegfried's entrapment by the sorcerer Von Rothbart and his disguised daughter Odile, and the final reunion of the lovers in death.What sets this production apart is its magnificent staging and excellent performances by the artists of the Royal Swedish Ballet.  Anders Nordstrom is a boyish Siegfried who seems to mature as we watch, until he makes the final step into adulthood with his pledge to die with his beloved.  Johannes Ohman is a hoot as sidekick Benno; watch his chagrin in Act I when the Queen discovers the court carousing after the King's funeral.  He and Nordstrom are also very fine dancers, effectively displaying their prowess in the Act I pas de trois (now a dance with two courtesans) and the Polonaise, which becomes a bravura drinking dance for the men.  Nathalie Nordquist is a lovely Odette, delicate and lyrical.  Her Odile, however, is somewhat less effective, perhaps because of her young age; she lacks the attack and sensuality of a more seasoned ballerina, and in her hands Odile becomes more charming flirt than evil seductress.  Still, Nordquist shows great promise in such a difficult role.  (For the record, my favorite Odile is Susan Jaffe's portrayal in "American Ballet Theatre: Variety and Virtuosity".)  The costume and set designs are sumptuous, if a bit dark, and the whole thing is a visual feast.  The DVD also includes fascinating extras, such as interviews with Nordstrom and Nordquist, a look back at other classic "Swan Lake" productions, and a chat with choreographer Wright about the story behind his staging (which is helpful if your ballet-mime-to-English is a bit shaky).  If you can only buy one "Swan Lake" for your collection, make it this one! </p>

 <p> Matthew Bourne's "Swan Lake" Ballet will not appeal to some...especially to anyone living in the backward, Bible-Thumping Bible Belt of the United States.  However, I want to go on record as saying that I totally enjoyed Bourne's modern-day version replete with it's homoerotic male-on-male dance partnerings and darker-than-dark plot.  Again, this version will not be for everyone...but, then again, neither is ignorance and bigotry.  5 Stars!  Buy it, and enjoy! </p>

 <p> THIS IS A NON-PROFESSIONAL REVIEW.SWAN LAKE- Swedish Royal Ballet w/ Natalie Nordquist & Anders NordstromThese notes were written as I watched the ballet. There is little chance you'll agree with my review of the first act & may think I'm ready to trash the whole performance.The prologue was well done as to the death of the prince's father. You get a little preview of the quality of the facial expressions you'll see throughout the performance. The darkness of the lighting was appropriate for what was being shown.Act 1 was a different experience for me. I quickly labeled this the Gray Ballet as there was subdued lighting combined with at least 8 different shades of gray in the costuming. Actually almost everything was grey, the floor, the backdrop, the overhead, most of the costumes & the constructs on stage. It was a costuming, set design & lighting mistake. If there had been a little more light then the detailing on the costuming, which was wonderful, but which you had to strain to see when not in close-up, would have shown up better & the costumes would have had the contrast wardrobe put into them. The principals were all dressed in gray as was most of the corps yet there was a splash of color on a few corps members, blue sashes, purple lining & some gold on the robes along with a very subdued green on a couple of the female dancers. This had the effect of making them, while standing off to the side, STAND OUT. It immediately pulls your eye off the dancing since gray dancers on a gray floor with a gray backdrop tend to disappear when a flash of color appears elsewhere. The color should have been on the principles, not much but some, either that or more light. The black & gold table cloth works fine in this scene, adding a rich & tapestry aspect to a dim view. The choreography, dancing & expressiveness are all top flight with a marvelous tempo to the piece. The orchestra performed wonderfully throughout the performance.Act 2 corrects the lighting & color problems enough to be admired. The floor is blue now, of course it represents the lake but the increase in lighting above is what helps so much. You now see the costume detailing. The entrance of Rothbart is as correct as Act 1 was not, lighting & costuming wise. He is at the back in dark shadows, wearing black & fades onto the stage. His costume seems to eat light, the epitome of a slimy & black-hearted creature lurking to do evil. Yet there is a silvering on the border of his feathers that reflects small rays of light, defining his costume & movements.Once again the choreography is beautiful as is the dancing & music. When the swans come on stage a change in lighting puts the very back of the stage in a blue cast & the front of the stage in a pale yellow. The tutu's of the swans change color as they move from front to the rear of the stage. Anytime they line up, whether straight or in a chevron you can see the last 2 or 3 have blue tutus & the rest yellow. I absolutely loved the pas de quatre.Act 3 makes much better use of the backdrop & constructs. Once again the blue floor & tutus changing color only add to the visual treat this has become. Odette's face is very expressive as it will be through the entire performance. This is not a dance but a living love of the part she is playing & it shows on her face & in her steps. You really notice the lack of light & color from Act 1 by contrast here. Once past Act 1 the lighting & color issues are corrected & improved from act to act. The ballroom & dancing are so perfect I can't describe it. It was a staggering thing to watch with the first act still in mind.The first folk dance, I thought the dancers looked like ballet dancers trying to perfect a folk dance. They had too much precision in their movements & not enough freedom as folk dancers would. The second folk dance was much better a freedom & flowing without a sense of trying to stylize what they were doing. The third folk dance returned to the same problem I had with the first one, but the fourth one got it dead perfect. I saw folk dancers not ballet dancers except for one easily spotted display of what I'm talking about as far as position dancing go.At the end of the fourth dance two couples are in front & they both assume the same position over the arm of the man & the woman arched backward almost touching the floor. The one on the right throws her arm over her own shoulder & it lays limp on the floor, which is correct for a folk dancer. The one on the left assumes the same position except her arm that is backwards over her shoulder is in a slight upward V shape, her hand formed perfectly for a ballet dancer.Odile is stunning; I'm thinking this Natalie is as good as anyone I've seen. I must state though, no one can match Plisetskaya's arm motion, and that was a gift I doubt will be repeated in my lifetime. Natalie's expressiveness, her tempo, her steps & the obvious joy she is having comes through even the TV screen.Act 4 is a marvel. I have only this to say, it is a glorious tribute to what ballet is & can be. The finale is the best I've seen period. At the end my wife was crying & I was wiping tears because of the perfection displayed on the faces of all the dancers. What a troupe this is. Harsh & uncomplimentary I was on the combination of set, wardrobe & lighting in Act 1. I must praise the choreography, dancing, expressiveness (whole troupe) & sets elsewhere. The lighting after Act 1 was particularly spectacular. I would rate this as perfect had there been in Act 1, a little more light or the accent colors on the principles not the corps dancers or a lighter colored backdrop. Of all that I think more light & moving the colors from the corps to the principles would be best. </p>

 <p> Let's start with the main positive point: A better-crafted Act 4 does not exist.  Period.  Now as to the negatives: First, Act 3 is the unbearably long, "unabridged" version which is (almost) never performed on stage, because all dramatic impact is lost.  Second, earlier on in Act 2, Siegfried spends too much time wandering around aimlessly with an exceedingly "gay" looking crossbow, at a time that instinct (and the music) tells you that swans should be coming on stage.  What a nuisance!  But despite its flaws (poor lighting, as another reviewer pointed out, being one of them), this is a worthwhile addition to any serious ballet fan's collection. </p>

 <p> As some one who is an expert on ballet(I am a ballet dancer), let me assure you that this is one of the top five performances of Swan Lake available.  The dancing of the entire company is extremely accurate and lyrical.  The use of mime is the best I have seen in any Swan Lake.  This is characteristic of Scandinavian traditon(the company director is proud to point out the contribution of the great Danish ballet choreographer of the 19th century, Bournonville, to the Royal Swedish Ballet in one of the many interviews on this dvd). The choreography is very well thought out and rehearsed.  The performance is fresh and vibrant, while still being classical and traditional.  The dvd is also very nicely packaged with a large and informative booklet.  If you are looking for a traditional Swan Lake performance,  don't pass this one up! </p>

 <p> I need not go into detail, as the other five star reviewers have said nearly all that need be said about this excellent production and performance by the Swedish Ballet.  I would add only that Swan Lake is a story ballet that requires acting as well as dancing.  Without abandoning gestures inherent in the original choreography, the Swedish dancers act their parts with both passion and restraint, whereas the Royal Ballet rather vapidly employ generic gestures copied from the Russians (who generally do such miming with greater flow and grace than the English). When I have a craving for the dark beauty of Swan Lake, I nearly always choose the Swedish version over any others.In fact, I have gradually given away or sold off all my other Swan Lake DVDs except that of the even darker, uniquely daring but profoundly effective production by Matthew Bourne starring Adam Cooper with all of the swans expertly danced by men.Tchaikovsky - Swan Lake (Matthew Bourne)In any case, the Swedes deserve five stars and more for their stunningly beautiful and refreshing (well, at times scary) 19th Century Gothic presentation of the original story and choreography. </p>
