<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Disjointed unbelievable pirate story </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I found this book too disjointed, jumping backwards and forwards in time with gay abandon. Consequently I did not enjoy the read as much as I had hoped and been led to believe from previous reviews. It does come together in the end but l felt unconvinced by the content and alleged time span. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Good story </p>

 <p> It was a good story, as I am a science fiction fan and haven't as of yet read to many pirate books, to me it seemed great </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Loved it! </p>

 <p> I really loved this book! It is clean, It has adventure, suspense, romance, and a bit of a &#34;Count of Monte Cristo&#34; moment!  Fun easy read! </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> a good story, but..... </p>

 <p> I really enjoyed this story and would have given it a 4 1/2 star rating but I had trouble following along because it bounced back and forth.  I'm a chronological person and would have enjoyed much more if I read the story as it played out.  I've read books that refer back to something, but this one started a new chapter several months later and then a few chapters later would start a new chapter a few months before. More than once I had to go back to beginning of the chapter to see the date and then back to where I left off to see where the story was. Overall: a good story. </p>

 <p> I thought this book was amazing. Adventure, love, and deception. It was a fantastic read! I finished rather quickly because I couldn't put it down. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> If you've traveled the roads of lower Cape Cod, then you are familiar with Black Sam Bellamy and the Whydah.  This book, though fact-based fiction, provides an interesting story behind the man.  I really enjoyed it.  If you're familiar with that area of Cape Cod, I think you'll enjoy the local flavor, too. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Pirates </p>

 <p> Black Sam,  Prince of pirates was fun read that gave me a taste of sea and real comparison of pirates vs Brits.  And whom were more evil. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Great historical fiction! </p>

 <p> I really enjoyed this book. A wittily written adventure, with a bit of romance. It brings to life the story of actual pirate Sam Bellamy. I liked the characters and the awesome plot twist! Get this book! Looking forward to more from this author. </p>

 <p> Story starts a little slow but stick with it.  MOST IMPORTANT pay attention to the dates at the beginning of the chapters!  This story is well told with many twists, I couldn't put it down and the ending lets just say is satisfying as the people stay true to their values and beliefs.  Much entertainment from a Kindle free read. </p>

 <p> I love mysteries that keep me guessing. I didn't figure this out until 2/3 or 3/4 of the book was done. Black San: Prince of Pirates is a couple of afternoons under a tree kind of book. The love story is well done and the action is exciting. I liked the historical parts, as well. Lately, I read several pirate adventures. I am beginning to think that that time in history was remarkable. Facing the vast ocean, with its storms and predators on a ship with nothing but sail power had to be a daunting challenge. When books both entertain and educate its a double win. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> A great pirate story with a twist at the end </p>

 <p> Even if you think you know the story of Sam Bellamy and his cast of shady pirate friends, you'll see a whole new side to this legendary character in Lewis' book.The story is easy to read. It has some humor, lots of action, and a great romance. (sigh) </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> OK </p>

 <p> Black Sam was an easy read romance. It was fine for a rainy day with nothing better to do, but would not call it great literature. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Chick book not for guys </p>

 <p> The title of this should be changed to &#34;Hey guys this isn't for you&#34; as it is the title is just false advertising. </p>

 <p> This was a fairly good  book it was gripping in parts but the biggest drawback was on my kindle when I would bookmark a page I would get thrown back several chapters.. </p>
