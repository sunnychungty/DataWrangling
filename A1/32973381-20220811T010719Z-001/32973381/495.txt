<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> A Connsumation gives you 25 sins to forget..that's 18 more than I expected!!! </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I didn't know quite what to expect of A Consummation, the first novella in the Sins of Lethe series, it sets the infrastructure storyline for future books of Lethe. And since I had enjoyed other books of Arden Aoide and never been disappointed by her writing... I started to read.I was captured from the beginning, Shula a young girl of just 18 was to enter into an arranged marriage to a much older man, a tyrant of a man called James, who she believed was evil. Her mother died to try and prevent it, her father wanted her gone.Shula is young but also brave beyond her years. She meets this challenge to marry James head on and has a plan to spite the arranged paring but her actions cause a change of events and also a change of intended husbands.. the story suddenly opens up to a whole new stratosphere of opportunities for Shula and Jared her change of direction husband and son of James.It is intelligently written with an element of intrigue that hooks you into the story. It's a little dark in places but offset with an underlying humor that shines through Arden's writing. She has set the groundwork in Consummation and I cant wait for the next book to continue the journey!!Oh...there is a cliffy ending, but hey all good authors leave you wanting more... I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something a touch dark & different in a love story with erotic undertones. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This is not Tame.  This is not Ancient Hunger.  It is something completely different.Set in 2250, Texas has seceded from the United States, and is a country of its own.  Women have been pushed back to their role from the very early years of our country; discouraged from learning and reading.  They are controlled.  And those who live in Texas are told that the United States and those who reside there are sinners of the worst kind.This is the story of Shula, just turned 18 years old.  Shula, whose hand was promised to Jared in marriage when they were children.  When Jared rebels against his father James, his father decides that he will take his son&#8217;s place as Shula&#8217;s betrothed.  Shula has been quiet long enough, and has decided that she will fight the impeding nuptials.This is also the story of Jared, who wants to make his own life outside of his father&#8217;s expectations.This is the story of James.  James is powerful in Texas, though for selfish reasons.  James has been through a few wives, and wants Shula simply for her blonde, light features as well as the fact that he plans to control her in an abusive way &#8211; the power to abuse women is his &#8220;high.&#8221;This isn&#8217;t a typical romance story.  I hesitate to put it in the fantasy genre either.  The author states in the introduction that it is for those who wanted darker; and it is not for the faint at heart.  If explicit talk of gratifying one&#8217;s self or scenes of male on male sex will disturb you, then this is not the book for you.I think we are seeing a series of novellas that will tell us the story of Shula and Jared, who seem to be falling in love in a society that does not want women to have free will.  That wants to dictate to their children how they shall live.  Further, it is complicated by our villain, James &#8211; who is Jared&#8217;s father.  I haven&#8217;t wanted to reach through a book and pummel someone in some time like I do this sick puppy.I found it interesting and was able to read it fairly quickly, without wanting to put it down.  I&#8217;m anxious to see what secrets James holds.  What secrets there are about Shula&#8217;s mother, and Jared&#8217;s younger brother, Jude. </p>

 <p> Great short story! I loved Jared and Shula and there were enough plot surprises and bad guys to dislike! I was sad when I came to the last page! Loved the variety for the sex scenes with different characters. I was very glad that Jared is not a bad guy, and the emotions and conversation are well written and believable. I can't wait to see what happens next! Great Read! </p>

 <p> 5 STARS for &lt;b>Originally!!!&lt;/b>&lt;b>UNCONVENTIONAL WITH A TWIST OF DARK!&lt;/b>&lt;i>&#34;Human ash was ridiculously difficult to work with when wet, but it was done&#34;&lt;/i>First sentence.Yep, I was hooked after that! This book was my first by this author, I one-clicked because of the cover. When I first started reading I thought the story would be dystopian. Nope, it's futuristic, but not. I thought the whole idea was brilliant. I thought the characters were intriguing. The writing style is unique. There were some shocking moments that I absolutely loved, some darkness that I crave in my books.I have to check out some of Arden Aoide's other work! </p>

 <p> This is a story that will make you think. Think that arranged marriages don't happen, but in this story it happens in Texas. Girls are raised to take care of her husband, children and the house. Letting the husband think for her too. When Shula is preparing to marry at 18, she can't believe that it will be to a man older than her own father. So she will make herself ugly for her new husband. When Mr. Angesson sees her he is ready to run away but he notices his son, Jared and makes him marry her. Jared Angesson was happy too but he had to make his father think he didn't want to marry her. SO now Jared will show Shula that they are partners and she is not his slave. They both will learn from each other. But his father will try to control their marriage as he does the town. Jared and Shula will fight for what they want. Will they be able to have control over their own lives? Will their fathers get what is coming to them? Arden Aoide has another great series starting here and what an ending. I can't wait for Devoutly, due out the end of July.Copy provided by the author in exchange for my honest review. </p>

 <p> Beauty and Pain. The depth of character that the heroine, Shula, conveys in this first part in a six part serial is so profound, I find it hard to describe just what I am feeling. First off, let me just say that she is truly an awesome chick. She is beyond strong. I can&#8217;t even fathom the idea of an arranged marriage, and her knowing and taking drastic efforts to make her life her own, well that&#8217;s just stronger than I can imagine. This story is futuristic, as in it takes place in 2250. In Texas. The country is not what it seems though. There have been many changes throughout the two hundred plus years and one of them, is catapulting women BACK into the eighteenth century. As a woman, while reading the astonishing beliefs of the main evil villain, James Agnesson, I was both shocked and awed at his depravity. I understand that some people are racist, or misogynistic, or just plain crazy, and James is definitely all three, but Arden&#8217;s articulation of these three intertwined just makes him plain SCARY. The world he resides in he is King. He takes this very seriously, even with &#8216;acquiring&#8217; an eighteen year old wife (Shula) after the deaths of two previous wives. Can we say foul play?Ok, back on track to Shula and her total kick-butt attitude. She is a very young woman who had to endure the death of her mother. The death she knows down deep in her soul was perpetrated to keep Shula from having to marry into the Agnesson family. Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t work and as the story unfolds, Shula is gathering all of her strength to exact her own brand of justice. She is going to make the ugliest bride ever. That&#8217;ll show King Agnesson and his superficial ways. It DOES show him, and instead of marrying her in front of the whole town, he pawns her off to his son Jared. Well, doesn&#8217;t that just throw a gigantic kink into Shula&#8217;s plans. Now what is she to do? She actually likes Jared.This is a brilliant beginning to a new series. It is different, and yet it contains ageless themes and morals. The bigotry, the kick-butt attitude, intense variety with the sex scenes, and the overall feeling will leave you breathless! I don&#8217;t want to give away too much, so just buy it and enjoy something amazingly different!5 ENORMOUS Smoochies~NicoleRed Cheeks Reads </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Shula Kelley is the strong heroine in this captivating series based around the year 2250 in Texas which has segregated from the United States. Texas in this era has converted back to the old ways in which women were born and raised to be barefoot and in the kitchen. They are controlled and heavily monitored, they are taught from birth to submit fully to their husbands without any learning, reading, writing or complaints of any kind. Arranged Marriages is the way, the only way in this dark era only Shula decides to stand up and fight for her right to live, learn and Love.Jared is the luscious Hero that patiently waits for his intended bride from a pre-arranged marriage. Jared is a smart and independent, a computer guru that contrives to make a name and a future for his intended without the aide of his father who is king of this generation. His sole purpose is to see that his bride lives in comfort and is well satisfied while he seeks justice and the demise of his controlling father.There is so much more to this story and I wait anxiously for the next installment. I need to see James the King, the father of lies, the shame of the devil himself get his penance. I will be there waiting to read about the women who finally burn their bras and the family who rise against their tyrant of a father and come together finally as a whole.Jared says it all and says it best: &#34;To become an alpha, you had to destroy one.&#34;Thank You Arden Aoide! </p>

 <p> Soo I was posting all the teasers for this book and was just getting more and more hooked on it. I really didn't know what the book was about but it was looking forward to getting my hands on it. I was not disappointed when I was gifted a copy from Arden Aoide ( HUGE thanks to you lady I want MORE now!!) Every Girl dreams of her wedding and wants to look her best, not Shula she wanted to show everyone how much she didn't want this wedding. See arranged marriages would be hard for anyone but knowing that your mother killed herself to save you from this arranged marriage really makes you not want it. Shula goes the extreme to show it why should she care, she plans on killing herself. But then at the wedding something happens and it makes the arranged marriage more tolerable. I am sucked into this world, it had to beginning of love, resent, plotting and murder it in. I can't wait to see whats next and what it was Shula's mother knew. I just know there's a lot of this story that had to deal with what she knew and why she killed herself. I believe fans of Arden's fans will not be disappointed in A Consummation. But I believe this will bring her more fans, and I am very excited to see where this series will take her.I was very lucky to be gifted with a copy for this review. Thank you Arden, I adore your work. P.S. can I have to the next book now please???I know I have to wait but I'm sure I am not the only one when I say WAITING SUCKS. </p>
