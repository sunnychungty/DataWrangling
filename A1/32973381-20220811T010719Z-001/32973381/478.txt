 <p> This book had me angry, crying, and sitting on pins and needles for the truth. I just wish the book was longer to really give the characters more time to go through their emotions. </p>

 <p> This book had a lot of potential.  As I read, I felt as if so much was missing that could have added to the depth of this story. The author did a lot of translating instead of letting the plot unfold. It started off really well and then it was rushed. Really lazy writing. This was especially evident in the end.  I don't understand how this book got five stars.  Then again I'm just spoiled from reading books from other writers, such Sienna Minx. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Lacks Depth, Rushed </p>
