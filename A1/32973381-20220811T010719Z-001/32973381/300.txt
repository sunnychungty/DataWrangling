<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Incredible show....totally surprised (and happy) that DirecTV owns this and not a pay channel </p>

 <p> Yes, other than Thandie, it's nearly all unknows (but you will recognize many of the faces....&#34;Continuum&#34;, &#34;Eureka&#34;, etc), but aside from the arguable lack of &#34;star power&#34; this is a top-notch show...and would fit right in to the HBO pantheon as a cross between &#34;Sopranos&#34; and &#34;The Wire&#34;.I can't wait for seaon 2!!! </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> At First Blush: There&#8217;s Little Right With ROGUE </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> As I&#8217;ve argued before, there are two ways to approach reviewing an ongoing television series.  Critically, the best way to gleam all the good, bad, and ugly for any program is to follow each and every hour, analyzing each one for strengths and weaknesses; however, that isn&#8217;t the way most folks approach television.  Largely, folks watch the first hour; make some rudimentary decision about whether or not the program interests them; and history is made &#8230; or it isn&#8217;t.  I call this process &#8220;at first blush,&#8221; and I applied it recently for the DVD release of ROGUE: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)From the product packaging: &#8220;Grace Travis (Thandie Newton) is an undercover detective, torn between her identity as a loving mother and her cold, calculating persona as an agent for crime boss Jimmy Laszio (Marton Csokas).  Tormented by her son&#8217;s unsolved murder, Grace conducts her own investigation, convinced that the killer lies somewhere within Jimmy&#8217;s treacherous ranks.  Now, in order to uncover the truth and stay alive, Grace must help Jimmy weed out the traitor in his midst.&#8221;ROGUE kinda/sorta made waves in the entertainment biz when it premiered as DirecTV&#8217;s first originally programming, and I suppose on that front most audiences might find it acceptable if not tolerable viewing.  Thandie Newton is, at best, a curious choice for a leading lady, much less an emotionally-tortured undercover cop as some criminal mastermind dabbling in international smuggling.  Her performance in this first hour is aptly described as palatable, but maybe that&#8217;s not her fault &#8211; perhaps she was doing the best she could with what she was given.I found it pretty difficult to sink my teeth, however, into anything here.  Newton&#8217;s command of the screen only surfaces in a few, spare moments as the bulk of this first episode spends far too much time introducing the audience to far too many secondary characters who may or may not mean something in a greater expansion of what&#8217;s truly happening here.  As a result, everyone &#8211; from her husband and daughter all the way to the seemingly endless line of seaport thug after seaport thug &#8211; comes across as very generic.  Not even the usual presence of notable heavy Marton Csokas elevates the material, and he&#8217;s arguably got on the best brooding, menacing mugs to come along in a long time.It&#8217;d be easy to chalk up a fair share of the hour&#8217;s weaknesses to the fact that writer/creator Matthew Parkhill really has a surprisingly thin resume for one given the task of manufacturing a hit out of a property packed to the gills with familiar faces and themes common to other programs.  Were there something novel, new, or exciting here, then ROGUE might not feel so routine.  To his credit, Parkhill does pack the last few minutes of this episode with a solid cliffhanger &#8211; one that less inexperienced audience members might be far more inclined than I to tune in again next week &#8211; but that&#8217;s 40 minutes too late for this neophyte cynic.  ROGUE&#8217;s world certainly could feel more like a place a viewer would want to visit more often, but &#8211; at first blush &#8211; this one is way too saccharin to find a notch on my busy viewing schedule.ROGUE: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON is produced by Entertainment One and Greenroom Entertainment.  DVD distribution is being handled by Entertainment One Entertainment (aka E One Entertainment).  As for the technical specifications, this is one smartly shot and produced program; the sights and sound are exceptional, perhaps leaving a lingering hint of some hidden greatness to come in the story department.  If it&#8217;s special features you&#8217;re looking for, then ROGUE&#8217;s release offers some script-to-screen featurettes as well as other fodder regarding the program&#8217;s webisode production.(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED.  Were it not so bland and uninteresting, ROGUE might be worth more than the investment of a single hour, but with so many opportunities for quality entertainment presented to audiences today I&#8217;m more than a bit perplexed why this show&#8217;s premiere story is so dimensionless.  Newton is a commodity worthy of celebration, but here she appears as a skinny little waif with some huge, unexplained chip on her shoulder.  To complicate matters, no one else seems remotely interesting, so I&#8217;m giving this one a pass for others to cover in greater detail.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Entertainment One Entertainment (aka E One Entertainment) provided me with a DVD copy of ROGUE: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution in no way, shape or form influenced my opinion of it. </p>

 <p> VERY MINOR SPOILERS: (my Amazon Prime Review 12/1/13)Plot Summary (with credit to Direct TV [edited]):"Grace AKA Jackie Hays (Thandie Newton), a morally and emotionally-conflicted undercover detective, is tormented by the possibility that her own actions contributed to her son's mysterious death. In her quest for the truth, Grace goes off the proverbial reservation in a not quite sanctioned undercover operation into the Laszlo crime family who runs the waterfront."OK, so starting with the obvious, Thandie Newton has long held marquis status on my personal visual bucket list. While perhaps not a household name, she has worked regularly since I first saw her in 1991 at a Boston "Art House" Cinema in the movie "Flirting." As hinted at in the subject header, Ms. Newton leaves very little to the imagination (anatomically speaking). Admittedly, the aforementioned likely counts for one of my stars.Ms. Newton's impressive "display" aside, Rogue is a multi-layered crime drama with plenty of good old fashioned violence and plot twists to go along with the nudity:1.) What happened to Grace's son?2.) Jimmy Laszlo the patriarch of the crime family:a. His quest for semi-legitimacyb. His relationship with and between his 2-sons: the introverted and seemingly bookish Max and the violently aggressive Alecc. The death of Jimmy's longtime accountant and a large sum of missing moneyd. Chinese gangsters looking to expand to the waterfront3.) Grace:a. Her interaction with her husband and teenage daughter while being frequently away/undercoverb. Her developing feelings for JimmyThere are some great ancillary characters:Ian Tracey as Mitch Mitchell, a burned out detective and former mentor who has been riding a desk. I have been a huge fan of Tracey since the short run of the excellent Canadian series "Intelligence". UK born actor Ian Hart, perhaps best known for his role in "Luck" as a down and out Detective with a penchant for having sex with one of his snitches and another initially unwilling Grace ally.Metacritics show a Metascore 47 with critics seemingly split (high scores from EW, which called Rogue "Delightful Trash" and the San Jose Mercury News, "Rogue does a nice job of methodically building an unsettling mood"). There has also been criticism (IMHO unfair) that for a production that is supposed to be billed as an American Crime Drama, the location filming is in Vancouver and a large part of the cast are foreign born.A must for Thandie Newton fans and a strong recco for everyone else! </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> A DirectTV Cop Drama That Feels Far Too Familiar, But Showcases The Lovely Thandie Newton </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I was excited to check out the original crime drama "Rogue" (which was made for DirectTV) for one primary reason.  For years, I have wanted to see Thandie Newton become a bigger star and get a vehicle that would allow her to demonstrate her acting range.  After her blistering and completely original turn in 1998's "Beloved," she has become a likable enough actress (the generic female lead in Mission Impossible 2, TV's ER, and an amusing turn as Condeleezza Rice in Oliver Stone's W are some highlights), but has never really gotten a chance to shine as brightly as in that titular role of "Beloved."  "Rogue" gives her the meaty opportunity to do something a bit different, to be sure, but also feels a little too familiar to be a groundbreaking discovery.  There have been countless shows on TV now that showcase a renegade band of cops willing to color outside the lines of the law to bring about justice.  And indeed, that is exactly the path that "Rogue" travels.  Set in the gritty streets of Oakland (what a great setting for a crime series!), I'd have hoped that this violent setting might have made this series really stand out.  Unfortunately, though, nothing feels particularly real on these mean streets and the depiction of Oakland (and the racial dynamic inherent in the city--in Rogue, the gangs battled are white and Chinese) is just as generic as some of the major plot elements of the show.Newton plays Grace Travis, an undercover cop on loan from the San Jose police department.  Her assignment has her on the Oakland docks trying to infiltrate a notorious crime family led by Jimmy (Marton Csokas) and his sons Alec (Joshua Sasse) and Max (Matthew Beard).  A personal tragedy rips her away from this mission at the most inopportune time and suddenly she finds herself trying to reconcile her family life with the calculating and cold persona she must adopt for work.  But as she deals with a personal loss, that investigation leads her (rather improbably) back into the clutches of Jimmy's gang of thugs.  This link is especially tenuous from a plotting standpoint, but it does get Grace back undercover.  In the end, though, the show takes a little too long to get where it's going and isn't always convincing on the journey.  I don't require a cop show to be entirely realistic (Cinemax's Banshee, for example, is over-the-top nonsense but enormous fun), but if a program takes itself as seriously as "Rogue does, I do expect a certain verisimilitude.  Newton is fine, as things go, but nothing is as compelling as it might have been.  I've simply seen this set-up too often and often executed with more focus.The DVD release features the ten episodes of "Rogue" on 4 discs.  It offers a couple of Bonus features:1) Featurette: Script to Screen2) Webisodes from the Rogue FilesDon't get me wrong.  I didn't hate "Rogue" by any stretch of the imagination.  Were it playing for free on TV, I'd say give it a look.  It's passable enough entertainment.  For me, though, it just never really connected on a visceral level.  After watching it once, I don't think I'd be compelled to view it again (which makes a DVD purchase harder for me to recommend).  The tagline of the show reads "Undercover. Out of Control."  But it lacks the wildness and unpredictability necessary to fulfill that promise.  But that said, it's always good to see Newton.  KGHarris, 3/14. </p>
