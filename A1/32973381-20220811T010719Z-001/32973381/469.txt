 <p> Lemons are quite expensive in Alaska however the seafood is plentiful. The recipes in this book have my mouth watering. I cook everything from scratch without added chemicals. I am a RN & understand the nutritional value of lemons. Thank you for these recipes, I will use them frequently. </p>

 <p> A very well-formatted book with attractive illustrations for each recipe. There's also a list of supposed health benefits of lemons, as well as their history.The only problem I found was that quite a few of the recies didn't specify how much salt was needed. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Where's the salt? </p>

 <p> &#34;Lemon-Cran Scones&#34; is from Top Chef contestant and host of Lifetime's &#34;Cook Yourself Thin&#34; Candice Kumai's cookbook, &#34;Pretty Delicious&#34; and as explained in Health magazine&#34;Blueberry Lemon Breakfast Quinoa&#34; recipe and picture in this book was posted on allrecipes.com by LilSnoo and not original with this publisher/author.&#34;Sticky Lemon Rolls with Lemon Cream Cheese Glaze&#34; is from the Internet site ivillage.com recipe #156732 including the picture.&#34;Gingerbread Muffins with Lemon Glaze&#34; is from the Internet site sallysbakingaddition.com posted 12/11/2012 including the picture from the site and the publisher of this cookbook cut off the copyright to the picture!  Do you think he/she knew it was &#34;stealing&#34;&#34;Date-Nut Bread with Lemon&#34; is from epicurious.com, #00316 and its reference blog, recipeldoodle.blogspot.com so there's nothing new in this book.&#34;Breakfast Pizza&#34; is really &#34;Blueberry  Lemon Breakfast Pizza&#34; from the Internet site backtoherroots.com owned by Cassie under date of 1/23/2011 including the picture Cassie  (the author of this recipe) took for her product on her copyrighted web site.  This publisher just ripped it all off to try and sell a book when he/she did NONE of the real work.  Cutting and pasting sand stealing is not really hard work. But designing, maintaining, cooking, testing and trying to make a living off your own true efforts is.  Don't support thieves like this publisher.The picture for &#34;Lemon Waffles&#34; is off the mrbreakfast.com site #298 but the recipe ingredients  left off the flour and the directions say to add it with the &#34;icing sugar&#34; and other dry ingredients.  Guess the fake author got lost in the copying/pasting process.And on and on and on it goes.  What a complete and total gyp even when it is free! </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Nothing new here, all off the Internet and copyrighted cookbooks. </p>

 <p> I can hardly wait to try a few of these out. I'm a huge fan of lemon flavor and love it in desserts and main dishes, so I can recommend this to anyone who loves lemons or who wishes to try something other than chocolate. </p>
