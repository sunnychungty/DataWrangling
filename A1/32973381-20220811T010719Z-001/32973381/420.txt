 <p> If you can get this book for free as I did near Valentine's Day, it's cute.  I honestly wouldn't pay $.99 for just 14 puzzles from anyone but feel it only fair to rate it as 5 stars for what it is, creative and quick, fun puzzles. </p>

 <p> 14 Valentine Puzzle Quizzes is a perfect game for the Kindle especially around Valentine's Day. The puzzles are not too easy because each one is differnt and you have to pay close attention to the pictures of the puzzles. They are not too hard to decipher, but I am glad I don't keep score. It is a delight to find a puzzle game that is so handy. </p>

 <p> clever puzzles and worth spending time on. challenge your mind, excercize your little grey cells. I would wish for a better way to flip back and forth to the solution but that does slow me down from cheating easily. </p>

 <p> This puzzle book is enough to fill your 10-20 minute breaktime from work or school.  Although suited for the love month of February, this can be perused any other month as well.  It's a short entertainment to pass time, while keeping score on your problem solving capability minus the pressure that problems entail, so it becomes fun.  Downside here is once you've solved the puzzles, there's no reason to go back to it again. </p>

 <p> Really enjoyed this Valentine-themed puzzle pack from the Grabarchuks- it's Lovely! This is the 2nd of their PuzzleBooks that I've played on my iPad via the Kindle App, and seeing the challenges in color is a treat. If you've never tried their books before, the puzzles start off easy and progress to Very Hard. Overall, they do a great job in rating the level of difficulty, so beginners and experts will both enjoy this neat collection. Hope they continue the themed puzzle back releases, they're very creative and a lot of fun. </p>
