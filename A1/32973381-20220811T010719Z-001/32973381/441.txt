 <p> She is returning to her home town for her best friend's wedding.  She passes thru the town to the house she grew up in...where the "bad stuff" happened.  She parked behind the house and tried to think of some childhood memories that might erase the anxiety she was feeling about entering the house and facing the inhabitants of the small town in the coming days.  When she left town, she walked away and did not say "goodbye" to anyone, friend or foe and now she has to confront the past... </p>

 <p> I did enjoy this book! There were a few problems with it though for me. It kept leading up to this big climax and I was waiting and waiting and finally with only a few pages left, everything was revealed! Some of it didn't seem probable, and I was hoping for a slower reveal. I was very surprised at who the killer was and some of the other twists and turns, but  there was so much that happened it could have all come out in a better way. I would still recommend the book. I have read all of Jennifer Hayden's books and I have enjoyed all of them!! </p>

 <p> I really liked this one!! </p>

 <p> This is the first book by the author that I thought was just ok. The women in her books are usually stronger and less annoying. I skimmed through a lot of the book to get past these parts. I will keep reading her books because for the most part they are really great!! </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Good </p>
