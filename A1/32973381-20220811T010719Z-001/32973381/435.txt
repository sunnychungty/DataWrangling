 <p> Excellent resource guide provides detailed information about what is required to get into the field.  I was encouraged by all the areas of specialization that employ voice actors.

 <p> I downloaded and read this book both out of curiosity and because my friend is thinking of getting into the voice-acting field when she retires. She has an amazing voice (people notice her voice all the time), but she has no idea how or where to get started. And she wants to start learning about this industry now, a couple of years before she retires from her current job in accounting so she doesn't face a steep learning curve when she's actually ready to start in this new career.I'm definitely going to recommend that she buy this book because it is just what she needs. The book explains the various ways a person can become a voice actor, offers approaches for developing and improving your skills, and provides different routes to get your toe in the door (with the pros and cons of each approach). The writing is practical, clear, and literally step-by-step. At the end are great resources (a comprehensive list of talent agencies plus FAQs, for instance). Readers of this book also learn about all other aspects of this business, from how to create a demo reel to prepping for auditions, choosing your speciality based on your skills and personality, and even how to set up your own promotional website. Pretty amazing and complete resource for those who want to get into this business. You'll walk away knowing exactly what you need to do, what you already have, and what you are missing. HIghly recommended for those interested in this field. It's literally a practical field guide. </p>

 <p> How to be a Voice Actor by Smithee is a great guide to get you started in VoiceOver or improve your skills. Having been professionally trained in VoiceOver I really enjoyed learning on a broader scale. My experience is mainly with commercials and some radio but Smithee showed me there are all sorts of other opportunities out there. This is a book you want to read if voice acting is a possibility for you!:) </p>

 <p> I have had an opportunity to talk in front of hundreds of people and try to improve my skills continually. I didn't realize, till reading this book, that I am in fact a voice actor. Also, I find many of the advises given for very useful - for example the importance of recording your own voice and listen to it regularly. Read this book if you use your voice in a some way and wouldn't be disappointed. </p>
