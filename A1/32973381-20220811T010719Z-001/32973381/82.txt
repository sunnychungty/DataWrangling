 <p> Another semi-professional shooter here. My primary camera is a D700 and I had a Canon S90 for about a year but always hated the controls of the camera. A co-worker recommended the X1 but that's more than I wanted to spend, so the Leica D-Lux 5 was a good compromise. Sold the copy of Lightroom to a co-worker(yes, Adobe supports this) and purchased an auto lens cover and leather case from an auction site and a grip from an independent seller. I carry this camera in my purse at all times. Took it to Hawaii (left the D700 at home) and just love the shots. The camera is so easy to use, and even the JPGs clean up nicely in Lightroom. The wide angle format is a lot of fun, and I use the scene modes quite a bit more than I expected (love the FILM mode especially). Save your $$ and buy the Panasonic battery and viewfinder if you want more accessories. </p>

 <p> My first Leica that is affordable. I was going back and forth between this and the Panasonic LX5 as they are essentially the same camera as I've read. I wanted something for travel and as a backup to my Canon dSLR. This is smaller than I expected which is actually great because I can fit it in my pocket!As for price, if you think about it, the copy of Adobe Lightroom and the 3 year warranty basically means it costs about the "same" as the LX5 if not getting a better deal IMO.  Yeah, I like the red dot too...and the build is really solid for this camera..and a beautiful one at that. The menu is pretty intuitive. The manual isn't all that informative.Picture quality looks great, I like the different formats..I can take square pics or wide angle..The special effects aren't as robust as the Olympus Pen, but I use graphic editing programs anyway....gets a little noisy above 1600  but again, I have noise reduction software..but for its size and convenience and the fast 2.0  lens, available light photography is great. I use this mainly as my street photography/photojournalism cam.I would've given it 5 stars if it had a viewfinder...I really wish these companies producing these compact cameras, 4/3 cameras and the like would have a built in viewfinder..it only makes sense. Also, don't get the Dlux4 battery for this, it won't fit. I have to wait about a month before they release the ones for Dlux5 and exchange the Dlux4 battery.But I'm happy so far and hopefully I'll be able to update to the M series someday. </p>

 <p> I am not as enamored as others about owning a Leica although I know they are famous for their cameras and lenses but this is a german camera manufactured in Japan.  There is no real difference between this camera and the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5 (same lens, hardware etc) with a $400 price difference and the LX5 has better ergonomics.  Stephen Huff's review uses the LX5 to review the D-Lux 5 in regards to the photos/video etc.  There may be something special in regards to the build but if you have to add a grip it seems superfluous.  It includes Lightroom 3...whoopie doo.. Yes, that is a $250-$300 program and if you have been dying to have it then this might be a great deal for you but you can't justify a $400 price difference just for Lightroom 3 unless it is an absolute must.  Okay, an extra year or two on the warranty?  Most of these cameras either work well in the first few years or they don't in the first year.  The warranty is mostly important for DSLRs.  I already have a Lumix dmc-tsi which I bought for my trip to Alaska a few years ago since it was waterproof but I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of photos and the video was remarkable.  I have used this as my p&s since then on several trips while dragging along my DSLRs and lenses.  We are now going to Ireland and I thought I would get another great p&s camera (my wife has a Canon s90 already) and settled on the Lumix DMC-LX5 and reluctantly I am leaving my Canon DSLRs and prime lenses behind.  Sure, if you want a Leica camera then this is the way to go but if you want a practical solution, and apparently there is no difference between this and the Lumix LX5....  I'll write more here and on the Lumix LX5 review later... just don't understand the attraction... of course, I'm just an average joe </p>

 <p> I ordered this camera back in May 2011 and immediately felt like I had made a big mistake. In the past months however, the camera has won me over to the extent that I now call it my number one. I carry it on my belt, and it goes with me everywhere I go. I initially bought it for exactly that reason. I was working with my tractor in the woods and the whole time an ermine followed me around, curious, and me with no camera.Now I can draw the camera in a flash and snap a photo whenever I see a good opportunity. I can't even quess how many more photos I shoot with this than I shot with my 40d, and more photos mean more excellent photos. I've surprised moose, antelope, deer, big horn sheep, eagles, hawks, herons, and more, but never saw the ermine again.What I like:Size, quality of image, quality of video, raw file capability, quality of view screen, did I say size?What I don't like:No reasonable filter option. I think this is really bad design. You can get an after market tube that looks for all the world like a sewer pipe with a window, but that defeats the point of having a small camera. Someday I will damage my lens -- $800 down the drain. Apart from this, I would give 5 stars.In closing, my photography has changed a lot with this camera. In the past, I always took photography too seriously. If it wasn't a great shot, I didn't take it. . . . and when I was with others, I participated but never documented. That has changed. Now when I am with a group, I am the one doing the documenting.. . . for what it is worth. </p>

 <p> I have the D-Lux 4. I don't own the D-Lux5 as I could not wait for its release date. But I was able to compare it to the newer D-Lux 5:-Dlux 5 has taller hotshoe mount-1yr Less warranty than the D-Lux 4-dial is prone to accidental setting change (better on 5 but not much)-Replaced joystick with wheel (better on 5)-Proprietary RAW format (RWL)-Better CCD on the 5-D-Lux 4 is 24mm-60mm where the D-Lux 5 is 24mm-90mm (35mm lens equivalent)-The D-Lux 5 can save to SDXC cardsImages on the Leica tend to be bias toward green as compared to Canon cameras. Easily corrected in Pshop (and about the only thing I usually correct, or crop)BTW, the Panasonic Lumix line (LX4, LX5) are the SAME inside, same camera, same lens, compared to the D-Lux 4 and D-Lux 5. Only the firmware in the Leica is different (and with the Leica you also get Adobe's Lightroom software so YMMV).One blog said that the Leica holds a better resale but I see the D-LUX4 sells used for $200 less than new, where the Panasonic Lx4 sells also $200 less than when new.It does a very good job shooting indoors over most and in low light exceeds.Things I would improve:- improve speed to save BOTH JPEG and RAW files (I had both a Class 6 and Class 10 SDHC card and it was slow to write)-Why do I need a bulky leather case that says "I have a LEICA in here";  just give me a wrist strap.-a wheel-lock just like the old SLRs had... Lift to turn...I would rate it 5 stars if it had a locking settings dial. </p>

 <p> I was looking for a compact camera that would fit in my jacket pocket and would take good quality pictures and have RAW capability. I currently have Canon T2 DSLR and a Canon Powershot SD700 but neither camera was suitable for all situations.I've owned the DLUX5 for about 4 weeks and there's zero buyer's remorse. The fast lens and functional freedom for me has resulted in some amazing photos, and hopefully after I understand more about the camera things will continue to improve.A couple of things worth considering  for potential buyers:Firstly, If you really need a viewfinder the solution for this particular camera is a bit expensive and secondly, the Lumix LX5 is the identical camera which sells for considerable less.For those that take the plunge and aren't already familiar with it's operation I'd recommend buying The Photographers Guide to the D-LUX 5 which is available in hardcover from Amazon or can be downloaded to an Kindle or IPad(via ITunes). The advantage of the book is that some features of the camera aren't explained in the manual. </p>

 <p> The Leica is an excellent point and shoot camera.It is expensive, and hence it is not for everyone!However, it offers a very fine quality and versatile zoom lens, which I believe is unsurpassed amongst current point and shoot cameras.The bright f2- 3.3 lens, with a 24mm (equivalent)wide angle is ideal for travel photographs in a broad range of situations.From my perspective, there are four critical characteristics of the lens which are of great value:1. The brightness of the lens,which is much superior to other p&s; cameras, at each end of the zoom range. By the way, the digital zoom reaches to 15x;2. The lack of distortion at wide angle focal lengths- this is a particularly good feature;3. The very wide 24mm wide angle- very helpful for a travel camera; and4. The very high quality of the lens- it is noticeable!The quality of the lens, and the ability to capture pictures in a broad range of situations was a critical consideration for me in deciding to buy the Leica. With previous point and shoot cameras (most recently a Canon SD950IS), I have found the most limiting factor for travel photography has been the limitations imposed by the optics. The Leica broadens the picture taking capability significantly, but you do need to take into account that the better lens does make it a slightly larger camera. I am happy to accept this in return for the enhanced versatility afforded by the higher quality optics.Other features I liked are:1. The flash- much better than the Canon (which had a tendency to allow red eye, even in "minimization" mode); and2. The ability to easily select from a broad range of aspect ratios (16:9, 4:3, 2:1 and 1:1) using a switch on the side of the lens.The quality of construction of the camera is impressive- it feels good to use, with precise controls.The cost may seem to be high. But, if you take a large number of pictures, I suggest you take into account the "per picture" cost as well as the value of getting good pics!! I took 14,000 pictures with my Canon over the last 3 years. By the end of that time, I suspect it was wearing out! I suspect I will take just as many with the Leica!If you appreciate a nice compact camera which takes good pictures, I believe you are unlikely to be disappointed with the Leica.By the way, to get an idea of the camera's capabilities, take a look at the sample pics I have uploaded and included in the product page. </p>

 <p> I purchased this camera a few weeks ago to try it out after hearing much about it.  Quite frankly I'm not sure what the hoopla is all about -- other than it has a red dot on it.  First of all I AM a photogapher.  I shoot with a Nikon D700, d300, a bevy of Nikon glass, as well as medium format Mamiya film and digital.  So yes, I do know what I'm talking about and this is not a casual review.The Leica is an incredible piece of metal.  I love the heft, and the feel of it.  The lens is superb at F2.0.  Love it.  I LOVED the 1:1 ratio which gave me square images -- one of the reasons I still shoot 2/14 film on occasion.  The video option was also awesome. I shot several movies in B&W; which was so neat and also in the 1:1 ratio  I loved it.  They were crystal clear in HD.My problem, and this could only be my problem, not yours was the image quality.  I shot a total of 263 images with the little gem and was extremely disappointed in the image quality. I shot mostly at ISO 80 which is the lowest;  I also chose an aperture between the F2, and F4.5 or 5.6 depending on the light.  I used a tripod for many of the shots but I just couldn't get over the smudging of the noise reduction.  Oh, I shot in both jpeg and raw format, which is how I shoot my D700, and D300 100% of the time.Anyway I shot and I shot away.  I had several designers I work with look at prints I made (11 x 14) and at 13 x 19 and they noticed the noise and/or the smudging.  Since I shoot for stock, working with several on line sites, as well as "real" agencies I submitted a batch of images to them all.  Each and every image was rejected from three online sites, and my agents due to "overall lack of focus and detail due to excessive noise reduction"  (which smudged the images).  Even when viewing them on screen in Lightroom at 100% they were awful.  I did submit the out of camera jpegs, as well as jpegs that I processed from the raw files in LR3.  Neither was accepted by anyone.  Since that is pretty much my bread and butter I decided to return the camera.  At $799.00 it's way overpriced (IMHO) as a piece of equipment that I can carry wherever for "the shot" when I don't have my dSLR's with me.  I believe the Panasonc Lumix, which is essentially the same camera without the red dot, is $300.00 less.  Even at the Panasonic's $399 or $499 price point it's still way overpriced due to the lack of resolution/sharpness even at the lowest ISO of 80.  I don't get it.  I played with every option in the menu's trying to get it to shoot correctly; shot the highest quality jpegs, and simultaneous raw file to no avail.  At this point I'm 99.9% certain it wasn't me causing this.If I were an amateur, and just wanted to capture atypical "I was here" shots, and videos I might be tempted. It is a gorgeous camera. But my being so nit picky about noise, grain, and image quality I just could not bring myself to keep this camera.On a side note Amazon and J&R; Music World were fabulous to deal with. Shipping was fast, return processing was fast as well and I was given my full credit as of last night. </p>

 <p> This is a fantastic camera. full manual control and shutter lag is reasonable for a compact camera.i have been able to get great shallow DOF at 24mm f/2.0 AND at 90mm f/3.3 and the pictures are extremely sharp - like a true leica.I bought this camera to take with me on my overseas trip to NY at the end of the year, in place of my D90 with 24-70 2.8 and 35 1.8G and have been really impressed with the capabilities of the camera in terms of image quality. build quality is also fabulous, as is the retro-chic styling of the camera.to be fair, i do not like that minimum aperture is limited to f/8.0 and the manual settings wheel is a little stiff, and a little small, making quickly setting manual aperture and shutter speeds a little slow. i also don't like that i had to shell out an extra $300 for an EVF, and the EVF resolution is quite low (but that is a different product, so i should make that review elsewhere). manual focus is strange - it is done by using the manual settings dial and a small picture-in-picture window appears on screen and you can see what is in focus in more detail. it is really hard to do and SLOW, but i cannot see why you would ever need it - AF is quite fast and accurate, no need for AF assist lamp.my camera is permanently set to dynamic black and white film; shots taken with this setting look AMAZING.if you do buy this camera, you will not be disappointed, it takes FANTASTIC shots - all of my friends with their D7000, D700, 5DII etc are all very impressed with that i have been able to do with this little one, and one friend has placed an order for one himself as well. The shots have that leica feel to them, if your skills are good enough to capture them, which cannot be replicated by anything from nikon/canon... something warm and yet dark at the same time? something special.in short, a gorgeous compact LEICA camera with brilliant image quality, full manual control and that leica feel which we all want to harvest in our shots. fabulous. </p>

 <p> I bought this with the EVF1 Viewfinder. This camera makes clear & sharp images and I like the RAW + Fine Jpeg setting. Working with the RAW files in Photoshop CS5 helps. I had a Canon EOS 5d Mark II and that was a great camera but I just got tired of carrying that theft and the extra lenses. With this Leica D-Lux 5 I like the easily changeable aspect ratios, especially the 16:9 & the various COLOR options... B&W; Smooth and B&W; Dynamic are rendering some interesting effects.The EVF1 is good but not great. The diopter offers some adjustment but the image through it is a little grainy. It's best suited for bright days outside, when the LCD screen is a little hard to see.I definitely recommend this camera. I recommend the EVF1, but only with limited expectations. </p>

 <p> Many folks on the Panasonic and Leica internet fora have discussed the prices of the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX5 and the Leica D-LUX 5. The discussion usually centers on noting that the two cameras are essentially identical. No question about it; both cameras share the same electronics and lens. So why buy the Leica?First, you're getting a longer warranty--two years for the D-LUX 5.Second, the Leica camera comes with a registration code for Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3, an excellent post-processing, DAM and workflow program that alone has sold for $299 at the highest price (though recently on sale for a substantial reduction). The LUMIX comes with SilkyPix Developer Studio SE, a program that I find to be a little difficult to warm up to, though it does a credible job.Third, and this is the best part for me: The D-LUX 5 is a Leica. It has a shape and build and finish that to me are elegant, minimalist and simply beautiful...more so than the Panasonic version. I own the LX5W and the LUMIX is a beautiful camera in white. But the D-LUX 5--a gift I bought for my wife--strikes me as being the better overall bargain and just a superb piece of craftsmanship. And yes, I do like the "red dot".Some will note that the Panasonic LUMIX has a grip for your right hand and the Leica does not. A very high quality third-party grip is available for the Leica (Google Richard Franiec) at a very modest price and I highly recommend it.In the end, what appears to be an unjustified higher price seems to me to be a well-justified expense. After all, remember what the auctioneer said: "The more you pay for it, the more it's worth"! </p>

 <p> Opinions on the D-LUX 5 </p>


<h2> review.date </h2>
  04-30-2011  
<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> I deleted my 1st review since I now have two D Lux 5's for comparison.  Each camera was slightly different from the other.  The disparities were two and this is when both cameras were set to factory settings.  The LCD display was brighter on one camera and the flash was also more powerful on this camera (camera 1).  The flash output can be adjusted and the LCD display has three settings, but camera 1's LCD display is brighter no matter what the setting. When the flash is set to zero on both cameras the output difference is significant. Batteries were swapped between cameras but the results remained the same.The red color issue is common to both cameras and cannot be corrected using either the auto white balance or manually setting the white balence to the correct Kelvin setting for the lighting condition.  The red color is not correct even if a white sheet of paper is used to set the K1 or K2 white balance.  I also changed the auto white balance manually and moved it to the more green setting.  This improves the red imbalance slightly but also overstates the green so no winner here.I photographed a ceramic sugar bowl I made years ago when my wife and I took our kids out for a arts play day (yes, my sugar bowl is really bad so I emblazed the word Help! on the lid). The predominant colors are yellow, green and rusty red.  The D lux 5 sees if differently with a brighter chartruse red that over powers the yellows and turns some of them to red.  The sad thing here is my Samsung Rugby II phone gets the picture color right.For a $800.00 camera this is simply not acceptable.  I don't want a camera that adds more brightness or color than I actually see.  I can understand if this was just one camera with a problem, but for two cameras to have the same problems and to also not match each other in flash settings or display brightness??  To bad, I really wanted the D Lux 5 to shine.  No recommendation here, just disappointment. I'm considering sending my new camera to Leica assuming they won't send me a refurb.  I'll update my review if this happens.I also don't understand all the rave reviews here. I cannot give a rave review to a camera no matter what cost I try justify. If it can't get the color right then it's not worth even $200.00 to me. Buyers...try testing the accuracy of the red colors. Two out of two cameras having the same problem is not a coincidence. Just to add....I am not a novice regarding photography. I have been taking photo's since I was 18 and always enjoyed quality photography gear going back to my Navy days with a Yashica SLR.  I've owned professional Nikons, Canons, Contax G2 and many more over the past 46 years. My color perception is perfect and has been tested by the US Navy and NASA.Follow up January 2012: I decided to send the D Lux 5 to Leica USA for a check-up. I really did not expect that they would find anything wrong with this camera as I had two samples of the D Lux 5 that shared the same problems, color and white balance. When I received the camera back from Leica I let it collect dust for weeks as I was busy shooting with another camera I recently purchased. There were a few items I needed to shoot in the macro mode so I unwrapped the "repaired" D lux 5 and set the camera up with my preferred settings using the auto white balance and then took a few macro shots. I was surprised at the quality of the photo's. The color was absolutely spot on and the subject was perfectly focused.  After trying many different modes I'm really pleased with this camera. Turns out you can get two bad eggs in a row. If I would not had these problems I would have given the D lux 5 a five star rating. </p>

 <p> I am a semi-professional photographer. Get paid occasionally, but It is at the very least a full-time hobby. And I also am finishing a B.A. in Photography. I bought this specifically as a "toss in the glovebox" camera to always have with me when I was not around any of my camera gear, and to take location scouting for various projects. Overall it is an excellent camera, with surprisingly easy controls (I'm not a gear nut so this is the only "enthusiast compact" i've ever had, but from what I can tell it is pretty awesome).I paid just over $500 on eBay for it. The $799 price tag is pretty steep for any camera of this type, and since all the other reviews say that the Panasonic camera this is a rebrand of has the same image quality/controls, then I'd just buy that, unless you can find a detail on the Leica version. Having the Leica version is nice because it inspires more confidence when I meet with someone who is paying me money to take pictures and sees me whip out a point 'n' shoot at a location.... more so than the generic looking, generic named panasonic. I also found a non-leica leather case on eBay that is an absolute MUST for this camera. Felt lined, two-piece, it looks incredible for about $50 shipped.The photo quality is impressive, especially from RAW (I have never seen a reason to shoot jpeg out of any camera... why cheat yourself out of editing headroom). I've done some serious  "damn it i framed way too wide" cropping, I mean like taken the middle third or quarter of the image, and the images are still sharp enough to use at least in web page form, large file size. Don't get too hung up on megapixels. 12 is more than enough for most things. I print up to 24-36" on the long side, and I've made 12mp look great even at poster size. So don't talk yourself into spending an extra grand on a camera with 16-18-20+ megapixels just because you get buyer's fever. My 18mp Canon EOS 7D makes moderately sharper prints at those massive sizes, but I have printed an image from my D-Lux 5 almost that size, and I doubt anyone but me could tell they were from different cameras, and then only because they were deep focus landscapes where everything was in focus. It really doesn't matter what resolution your photo is if it has thin DOF and most of the photo is blurry anyway.The little aperture/shutter speed adjust dial by your thumb is small, but works great considering it is almost invisible. in Aperture Priority just rotate the dial to adjust aperture just like an SLR (ditto with shutter speed in S-mode). Press the little dial in (like a button), and you have quick access to exposure comp. ISO and white balance functions are quick access.The rear LCD looks pretty good, but these days all of them look pretty good. Not worth mentioning more.Focusing is about as fast as any newer point-n-shoot, which is about average I guess. It is disappointing if you are used to DSLR optical autofocus. Contrast detect AF just plain sucks, and even when camera manufacturers try to improve on it, they can only make is suck slightly less. That's just the rule of the game at today's current tech level. The F/2 lens gives pretty good moderately shallow DOF considering the size of the sensor, with decent bokeh. Some of the best you will see without seeking gear that is designed for good bokeh and short DOF (I.e. full frame sensor camera, LEICA R glass, etc)Besides the high retail price, the SINGLE issue i have with this camera, is that if I turn it on with the lens cap on, It just keeps asking to remove the cap. It doesn't look like you can just go into playback mode to quick browse through the images. You have to take the cap off, which I think is a waste of time. Why not have a simple menu item to change this, because I can't be the only one who turns their camera on to look at the pictures frequently (or to show an image to someone else). It is a pet peeve, but I judge my gear pretty harshly if it interrupts the pace I work at (especially if i pay over $500 for a damn tiny camera only to have it bug me to remove the lens cap when I don't even want to take a picture)So I gave it FOUR out of FIVE stars for a combination of the high price, and for the lens cap annoyance. Other than that, i LOVE this camera. I find myself always taking it out of the case and handling it when i'm at rest and I have the camera with me. </p>

 <p> I have had my D-Lux 5 for just a few days now, and I am delighted with my choice.  It's all that I expected and more.  Build quality is superb (as expected), picture quality is excellent, and there's even more flexibility and features than I had imagined.  Definitely a winner!UPDATE:  After living with the D-Lux 5 for quite a while, and comparing its results with other cameras I own and use, I am less enthusiastic.  I have found that the Lumix DL5 (almost identical in most respects) gives me better results for a lower price.  I would now rate the Leica at 4 stars. </p>

 <p> I bought this camera about 2 months ago... and i'm just lovin it more with time. Great Leica lens with unmatched picture quality from any of it's close competitors (even to quite similar one's like the Panny LX5). The D-Lux 5 comes packed with Manual controls and plenty of pre-configured shooting modes (portraits, babies, landscapes day/night...). I read it somewhere in the reviews that the menu configuration is some how cheap and not up to the level- which I certainly don't agree with for two reasons: 1- it's simple and intuitive and you get used to it in few days of operation. 2- I see it more as a German type oriented software with no complication in design; after all the Leica appears vintage and the menu style should complement the looks. Size and weight are important features of the D-lux 5 to consider, if you're willing to carry it with you on travels.I am not a professional photographer, but I did compare it with my friend's Panny LX5 and to Canon's 550D dSLR. I tried shooting starry sky mode (moon and stars) which I consider challenging because of "low light" situation and the picture exposure and saturation was superior to the shots taken by the other 2 cams. Now, I am quite positive that the Leica lens with the internal processor are far superior together than most, if not any other similar product. And yes it's a bit more pricey but if you can afford it you should get it!On another note,the major downside (in my personal opinion)is that Leica didn't release much gears and accessories for the product although its Panasonic sibling has (i.e. wide angle/macro lenses). These lenses can only maximize the utility and enjoyment of the D-Lux 5. However, you can use the Panny lenses as they fit both cams.I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a high-end product characterized with superior picture quality and portability! </p>

 <p> I'm very happy with this camera.The only up side to having my D-Lux 3 stolen this past summer was that the D-Lux 5 was soon to be released. I use a camera for my work - which is mostly point-and-shoot locations stuff - but I also want the ability to take beautiful pictures when I have the time.This camera gives me what I need.I love the simplified menu, the rear dial, the hot shoe for my viewfinder and flash, but most of all I love the quality of the pictures I can get whether it's a quick snap-shot or a nicely composed portrait.It's not a pro camera but it's a great camera for someone (like me) who carries a camera with them at all times looking for that great image.Warranty is great and Light Room is a nice addition. As for concerns over the price difference between this and the Panasonic version c'mon, you spend that much for premium cable every month. </p>

 <p> Then it would be almost as good as my iPhone. The image quality is about the same. Not sure what you all are raving about but this is the nicest Panasonic camera on Amazon. </p>

 <p> Would be nice if this camera had a phone built in </p>
