<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Sweet version of the Annie Oakley story </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> "Annie Oakley"(RKO, 1935)--------------------------------This is a fun, sweet version of the Annie Oakley fable, with a scrumptious young Barbara Stanwyck in the starring role. She's all a-twinkle as a simple country gal love-smitten for her fellow sharpshooter, Toby Walker (a fictional stand-in for the Wild West show performer Francis E. Butler, who married Oakley in real life...)  Played here by a dashing Preston Foster, the "Walker" character is both heroic and tragic -- he appears full of bluster and ego, but we soon learn it's all for show: he teaches Annie the ropes of showbiz, and they put on an act for the press, pretending to have a fearsome rivalry when in fact they are in love. Fate tears them apart; love brings them back together, but only after a 1930s-style romantic melodrama, with a little light comedy.  Some of the film's trappings don't age well -- particularly the stereotyped depictions of African-Americans and to a lesser degree, the Native Americans in the Buffalo Bill show -- but the film is basically nice light entertainment.  And if you, like many of us, totally adore Stanwyck as an actress, this is a perfect film to see her in her full, youthful dewy-eyed bloom.  Recommended!  (Axton) </p>

 <p> THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS MOVIE COLLECTION WAS THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH MOVIES. OR I JUST WATCHED THEM TOO FAST. I LOVED THEM. THE PICTURE QUALITY WAS EXCELENT AS WAS THE SOUND. NOW I WANT MORE OF BARBARA. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Great collecton of films mainly focusing on Stanwyck after 1945 </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This collecton honors Barbara Stanwyck's 100th birthday with six titles not previously on DVD and under the control of Warner Home Video. Her screen persona was generally that of a tough-as-nails woman of the world, sometimes with nefarious motives, and this collection tends to give you a broader view of her talents showing fine performances in some well-known as well as lesser known films. All of these films are in the post-code era, and this is probably because Warner Home Video has plans for her pre-codes in their Forbidden Hollywood series. For example, WB has already announced that they have plans for Stanwyck's classic pre-code "Night Nurse" to be put on DVD. At any rate, here are the films and extras in this set:Annie Oakley (1935)The oldest film in the collection, great dramatic license is taken with Oakley's real life story. Stanwyck does a good job of portraying Oakley in this film, still making use of the tough reputation she had in parts in the pre-code era and translating it into a time when less could get past the censors. There's quite a bit of comedy in this western, and George Stevens does a good job of directing all involved.Special Features:Main Street Follies, vintage 1935 short starring Hal Le RoyInto Your Dance, vintage 1935 cartoonSubtitles in English and FrenchMy Reputation (1946)Next we jump ahead ten years with Stanwyck playing a woman who is grieving over the death of her husband.  She not only has the timeless problem of being a single mother raising two teenage sons, she must also deal with the issue of her reputation - as dictated by society at that time and by her mother and friends specifically. She gets involved with an Army officer (George Brent) who is the love them and leave them type, and as a result has trouble from everyone she knows. Stanwyck is great as a woman who has to learn to go it alone and stand up for herself for the first time. Brent is less convincing as a bit of a cad - he usually plays such stand-up guys and even played opposite Rin-Tin-Tin early in his career! At any rate, it's a good display of Stanwyck's talents in a different and vulnerable kind of role for her. Not previously on VHS or DVD.Special Features:Jan Savitt and Band, vintage Warner Bros. musical shortDaffy Doodles, vintage Warner Bros. cartoonAudio Only Bonuses: Vintage Radio Versions - Lux Radio Theater adaptation with Barbara Stanwyck (4/47) and Screen Guild Theater adaptation with Alexis Smith (7/47)Theatrical trailerSubtitles: English, French & Spanish (Feature film only)East Side, West Side (1949)This is a movie along the lines of a film noir and has Stanwyck playing a Manhattan woman who is devoted to her philandering husband (James Mason) who claims he loves her in spite of his weakness for serial affairs. One of his past flames, Ava Gardner, is back in town to try to take Mason away from Stanwyck permanently. This film also reunites Stanwyck with Van Heflin who both have great chemistry together. Great performances, a good plot, and an overall enjoyable film.Special Features:Counterfeit Cat, vintage MGM Tex Avery cartoonStuff for Stuff, vintage MGM short subjectOriginal theatrical trailerSubtitles: English and FrenchTo Please a Lady (1950)This film pairs Clark Gable with Stanwyck. Gable plays a renegade racing driver whose driving tactics during a race cause the death of another driver. Stanwyck plays a no-nonsense newspaper reporter out to expose Gable's professional tactics and end his career. This might actually be more interesting to car racing fans than to Stanwyck fans because of the great footage of racing and behind the scenes footage of the sport as it existed in 1950. Stanwyck does the best she can with a somewhat thin script, and it is above average entertainment, but it is probably the weakest entry in the set.Jeopardy (1953)This film is a thriller that is rather hard to categorize - it is almost avante-garde in nature. It starts out calmly enough - the Stilwin family is vacationing on an isolated stretch of beach. However, while rescuing their son, Doug Stilwin (Barry Sullivan) gets his leg caught and is stuck in the water. He is fine now - at low tide. High tide will be another matter. His wife (Barbara Stanwyck) goes for help and instead picks up an escaped killer. He proposes an interesting trade to her in exchange for his help. This is a great suspenseful movie and I'm surprised it is not better known and not shown more on TV. Meeker is very good as the criminal. His onscreen persona is an interesting cross between Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando and he has good chemistry with Stanwyck in this one. Not previously on VHS or DVD.To Please a Lady and Jeopardy are a double feature and have the following extras:To Please A Lady original theatrical trailerJeopardy original theatrical trailerAudio Only Bonus: Jeopardy 1954 Lux Radio Theater Broadcast with StanwyckSubtitles: English, French & Spanish (feature film only)Executive Suite (1954)Probably the best known of the six films in this set and probably the most awaited as far as DVD releases go. The funny thing is, Stanwyck isn't really the star in this movie - William Holden is. That's not to say Stanwyck fans won't get their money's worth though, particularly in her showdown scene with Holden and in the last scene where she outperforms everyone just by sitting in a chair and observing. This film is about the details of a power struggle when the founder of a large corporation suddenly dies. It basically boils down to two factions - the innovators and the bean counters. It's how these two groups dance around each other in their maneuvers for power that will hold your interest. The film is still relevant because big business is still about these two groups today. It is a common story of business - someone starts a company out of their love for building a superior product and somewhere along the way - often after the founder's death or retirement - the bean counters take over and regard only profits without remembering that the superior product is where those profits come from. Outstanding entertainment.Special Features:Feature commentary by Oscar-winning director Oliver StoneOut for Fun, vintage MGM Pete Smith ShortBilly Boy, vintage MGM Tex Avery CartoonOriginal theatrical trailerSubtitles: English & Spanish (feature film only)My biggest disappointment in this set is a lack of biographical material on Stanwyck's career, which was a long and illustrious one. It does look like WB gave Executive Suite good treatment with the feature commentary, though. </p>

 <p> This is a very likeable movie about the fantastic sharpshooter, Annie Oakley.  It doesn't deal much with her early life, but rather opens with the first shooting match against the world famous "Walker", who in real life was Butler.  We are treated to some delightful Wild West rodeo scenes.  And just overall the movie has a very likeable quality.  The love story is partially true and partially made up.  However, overall the basic facts are pretty accurate.  Barbara Stanwyck is a very natural choice for the lead role.  And the Chief who portrays Chief Sitting Bull is very charming as well.  This movie is suitable for family viewing and watch out, it will make you want to try out your marksmanship skills before the end! </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Not very accurate, but a nice Stanwyck vehicle </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Barbara Stanwyck hadn't yet settled into her "tough broad" persona when she made this movie (she was only 28), but it was her first venture into something that might be called a Western, a genre of which she went on to appear in many examples, being a great admirer of the pioneers.  Ironically she was (according to one historian) terrified of guns!  For all that she makes a believable sharpshooter.  In 1885, Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show is the newest and greatest thing around, and Bill's (Moroni Olsen) partner Jeff Hogarth (Melvyn Douglas) has just signed on a brash Bowery rifleman, Toby Walker (Preston Foster), who's never been west of St. Louis and has rather a scornful attitude toward "those hairy-pants rubes."  In rural Ohio, young Annie, who for the last five years has supported her widowed mother and two siblings by her wizardry at bringing down game, sees a poster featuring Walker and is immediately smitten.  When Hogarth and Cincinnati hotelier James MacIvor (Andy Clyde) make a bet pitting Walker against the shooter who's been supplying Mac's kitchens with head-shot quail, neither one knows that she's a girl.  But she soon dazzles the assembled multitude with her marksmanship, and even after she deliberately throws the match, Hogarth knows she's a natural for the show.  Toby soon takes an interest in polishing up her act, and she becomes a great success, also striking up a real attachment with him, and even attracting the attention of Chief Sitting Bull (Chief Thunder Bird).  Then the supposed "rivalry" between the two shooters seems to turn serious when Annie's hand is injured and Walker is blamed for it and fired from the show, though even a triumphal tour of Europe can't put him out of Annie's mind.This old-fashioned biopic is only partly accurate (readThe Secret Annie Oakleyfor a better fictional treatment), but the young Stanwyck is really rather charming, and the show sequences are especially good.  A note of humor is added by Sitting Bull's various encounters with civilization (especially the scenes in which he spots Toby in the audience and tracks him down through the New York streets so he can take his "Little Sure-Shot" to her beloved). </p>

 <p> I was really glad to see this finally come out on DVD, but I wish it would be available separately (although you usually can't go wrong with a Barbara Stanwyck movie.)  The transfer is pretty darn good, too, for a film this old.Stanwyck's portrayal of Annie Oakley made this film.  Tough-as-nails, Barbara also had a soft side she could show, and she does both here. She was a versatile actress who could play any role.Preston Foster's character, "Toby Walker," meanwhile, undergoes one of the fastest transformations I've ever seen on film, from arrogant pig to very likable good guy in no time at all.I've seen movie twice now and enjoyed it very much both times. It's a fast-moving film that entertains. </p>

 <p> Barbara Stanwyck does a fine job portraying the backwoods country girl, Annie Oakley, who became famous as one of the greatest rifle shots in history.  It does a entertaining job of following her into show business with Buffalo Bill's Wild West show.  Toss in a few famous figures and a little romance and the movie is a nice little entertaining film to watch. </p>

 <p> Annie Oakley (1860-1926) was the first female superstar. She came to national attention when she joined Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show in 1885, and for the next 40 years she made headlines around the world. This 1935 black and white film is the first movie to dramatize her life. A young Barbara Stanwyck (1907-90) stars as Annie. Stanwyck made more than 80 films and was nominated 4 times for an Oscar ("Stella Dallas", "Ball of Fire", "Double Indemnity", "Sorry Wrong Number"). She won 3 Emmys ("The Barbara Stanwyck Show", "Big Valley"). AFI lists her as # 11 among the "Top 100 Greatest Screen Legends" and her character in "Double Indemnity" achieved # 8 as "100 Greatest Screen Villains". But here in 1935 she is remarkable sweet and tender in a romantic comedy that works.Annie would be played by Ethel Merman (1946, 1966), Betty Hutton (1950), Mary Martin (1957), Geraldine Chaplin (1976), Reba McIntire (1996), Bernadette Peters (1999), and Susan Lucci (2000). Cute Gail Davis played her on TV in the "Annie Oakley" series (1954-6). My favorite is Gail Davis, but there's nothing wrong with Stanwyck's portrayal here.Preston Foster (1900-70) plays Annie's love interest and is modeled after her real life husband who was also a sharpshooter.  Foster appeared in over 100 films, and is best known for playing in the "Northwest Mounted Police" (1940).Beefy Moroni Olsen (1889-1954) plays Buffalo Bill. He made his film debut as Porthos in "The Three Musketeers" (1935) and gave many memorable performances in the 30s and 40s in films like "Mary of Scotland" (1936) and "Santa Fe Trail" (1940).Melvyn Douglas (1901-81) plays "the other man". Douglas was a great actor, nominated 3 times for an Oscar with 2 wins  - "Being There" (1979) and "Hud" (1963). He won an Emmy for a 1967 episode of CBS Playhouse and was nominated for a 1965 performance of "Inherit the Wind". I remember him best in "I Never Sang for My Father" (1970).Short and squat Dick Elliott (1886-1961) plays Ned Buntline. Elliott appeared in 200+ films between 1933 and 1958. He's best remembered as Mayor Pike from "The Andy Griffith Show".Chief Thunderbird (1866-1946) plays Sitting Bull. Thunderbird made a dozen plus films between 1930 and 1944, usually playing a chief.George Stevens (1904-1975) directs. He was nominated for an Oscar 5 times and won twice ("Giant" and "A Place in the Sun").  16 of his films generated 69 Oscar nominations and 15 wins. Some of his memorable films include "Shane" (1953), "I Remember Mama" (1948), "Woman of the Year" (1942), and "Alice Adams" (1935).1935 was a good year for films."Mutiny on the Bounty" and "The Informer" were box office and Oscar winners. Other top 10 grossing films included Gable and Harlow in "China Seas",  Flynn and de Havilland in "Captain Blood", Shirley Temple in "The Littlest Rebel" and "Curly Top", and Greta Garbo in "Anna Karenina". Other notable films released that year included "Alice Adams" with Hepburn, "The 39 Steps", "The Bride of Frankenstein", "David Copperfield", "A Tale of Two Cities", "Les Miserables", "Top Hat", and "A Night at the Opera". In Germany, Leni Riefenstahl released "Triumph of the Will".The NY Times called it "a gaudy and pungent motion picture, smacking healthily of that obscure commodity known as tanbark" and "superior entertainment." They praised the cast - "Stanwyck is splendid in the title role; this is her most striking performance in a long time. Preston Foster plays persuasively...and Moroni Olsen is excellently bluff as Buffalo Bill. Chief Thunderbird, though, is the star of the picture."The acting is good but what really sets this film apart are the marvelous scenes of Buffalo Bill's show, with cowboys and Indians, settlers, horse riders, rope tricks, and the sharpshooting. We also get to look behind the scenes of the show, which is even more interesting.Bottom line - a good romantic comedy about life in a wild west show at the turn of the 20th century. </p>

 <p> So good to see these films.  I bought this package for the film There's Always Tomorrow: 1956.  A film that shows the angst of the man who is not appreciated by his busy wife and oblivious children, but taken for granted.  Plenty of films about women, wives in that predicament. But I've never seen a film that shows the man's feelings.  Joan Bennett (femme fatale in previous decade) plays against type as the wife, and Barbara Stanwyck is the woman who finds a passionate, illicit  love life with this husband and father.  The husband gets to express how he feels and what he can't have, as the forgotten man.  The bonus is the other films: Internes (sic) Can't Take Money, 1937 ( my favorite decade for films) All I desire 1953, The Bride Wore Boots, 1942, The Lady Gambles, 1949, The Great Mans' Lady, 1942.  Barbara sure was a busy actress. </p>

She demonstrated the ability to play just about every role imaginable and this set is a nice cross section - even 'Executive Suite' where she does not have a leading role, but is an integral part of the film.This collection is a must for any Stanwyck fan.

 <p> It's a shame that Miss Stanwyck finally gets a box set released (celebrating her 100th birthday), and most of the films are lackluster, or not the smashes that her ealier stuff was. When we are now seeing Tyrone Power having a 2nd box set released of all his 30's films (by Fox), it's a downright SHAME that we only have this one set showcasing the #11 All Time Female Movie Star, as determined by AFI.  The difficulty is that she freelanced with all the studios, making it harder to get everything released and cross-licensing would be involved to have an extensive set. I hope that by the end of 2008 we'll see more of her ealier work on dvd. Or even Sony/Columbia needs to step up w/all of her Capra films.  What a bummer, but i'll keep hoping! </p>

 <p> This 1935 film, starring Barbara Stanwick as Annie Oakley, has been remastered and restored, so that the print is as good as new and the soundtrack is clear. It is also the first feature film about the life of Annie Oakley, though not the last. It is also Barbara Stanwick's first western.The film presents a somewhat fictionalized version of Annie Oakley's life. It focuses on her start in the Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show as a sharp shooter and her romantic interest in the show's other sharpshooter, played by the very handsome Preston Foster. With a bit of romance and comedy, this is a well acted, entertaining black and white film.  Modern day sensibilities may be affronted, however, by stereotypic depictions of African-Americans aive Americans, which were reflective of the era in which the film was made. </p>

 <p> Barbara Stanwyck Signature Collection DVD Review </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> In honor of the 100th birthday celebration of silver screen legend Barbara Stanwyck, Warner Home Video finally releases six classic films, previously unavailable on DVD, remastered and complete with special features galore.The prestigious "Signature Collection" series boasts excellent packaging and ample special features, but this time around the selections of films aren't quite as spectacular as some of their previous choices. Several of Stanwyck's better films may be wrapped up in rights issues, and this feels lacking due to the absence of more noticeable titles.Stanwyck was destined for fame ever since landing her first movie role in a Frank Capra-directed feature and then in Baby Face for Warner Bros. which notoriously forced the creation of the production code. During her 37 years, she received four Academy Award nominations, an honorary Oscar in 1982 and the American film Institute's Life Achievement award in 1987.One of the stronger films of the collection, Annie Oakley sees George Stevens direct, Preston Foster as Toby Walker and Barbara Stanwyck as the title sharpshooter. Years before Irving Berlin's hit Broadway musical, Stanwyck shaped the historical figure into a memorable bit of cinema. Despite being largely inaccurate to the real-life Oakley, this western comedy is still remarkably entertaining and carries a carefree lightheartedness as only ever-present in such silver screen fun. A 1935 vintage short and a cartoon accompany the feature.East Side, West Side has a great cast including James Mason, Ava Gardener, Van Heflin and Cyd Charisse. Stanwyck plays a loyal housewife who has difficulty hanging on to her husband after he is seduced by Gardener, whose performance almost outdoes the leading lady. A great dramatic tale this 1949 classic features its original theatrical trailer plus a companion short subject and a Tex Avery cartoon.Perhaps the most revered and critically acclaimed film of the lot, Executive Suite reunites Stanwyck and William Holden in a captivating boardroom drama. Directed by legendary Robert Wise, this Ernest Lehman adapted film, based on the best-selling novel by Cameron Hawley featured an impressive MGM cast including Frederic March, Walter Pidgeon, June Allyson and Nina Foch, who earned an Oscar nomination for her role. A Venice film Festival special jury prize winner, this powerful drama features a full-length commentary track by Oliver Stone, its original theatrical trailer and a vintage cartoon and short subject.Barbara Stanwyck plays Jessica Drummond, a wealthy suburban housewife, in My Reputation. Grieving over the loss of her husband who died in battle, she must raise her two adolescent sons alone, resulting in further empathy from the audience. Jessica meets an army officer on leave and hopes to find love again, despite the interference and meddling of her social circle friends. Not one of her more memorable roles, My Reputation features a musical short, cartoon and audio tracks of radio theater adaptations with Stanwyck and Alexis Smith.The final disc of the set is a double feature combining Stanwyck's To Please a Lady and Jeopardy. In To Please a Lady, Clark Gable joins the fun as a renegade racecar driver whose questionable tactics result in the death of another driver. Stanwyck is the no-nonsense reporter out to end his career - except that the two fall in love, expectedly complicating matters. Shot at the site of the Indianapolis 500, this largely forgettable film has more lasting power for auto racing enthusiasts. Jeopardy features director John Sturges keeping viewers on the edge of their seats as Stanwyck and Barry Sullivan search for their missing son on the Mexican coast. With plenty of twists and turns, this Hitchcockian thriller features the original theatrical trailer and Stanwyck's 1954 Lux Radio theater broadcast.Barbara Stanwyck is undoubtedly one of the greatest actresses of the silver screen, and this set gives a decent sampling of her undeniable talent, but her absolute best works are either part of other company's collections, still currently unavailable, or curiously absent.- Mike Massie </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> "Annie Oakley" (1935, dir.: George Stevens) is an important milestone in Stanwycks career, seeing her in a western for the first time. It is a fine comedy with a good Barbara Stanwyck who may ride and shoot better than most men - based on the story of the real Anny Oakley, the first woman to star in the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show. It's not as funny as any of the upcoming screwball comedies, neither is Stanwycks performance as complex and sophisticated as in later dramas, but it's quite good entertaining. </p>
