 <p> I found the quality of the bag to be great, it had what I wanted, more space, more pockets and the fabric and zips and the pads are amazingly comfortable. Great buy and the deliver was amazingly quick. </p>

 <p> This is the best backpack that I have ever had. It is very tough and durable, yet not heavy. The pads at the back of the bag make it very comfortable while you wear the bag. It has some awesome features such as shock absorbant flaps (the loops that you put your arms through), a very useful center pocket where I keep my keys, ipod, phone etc.. It has a pocket for the laptop and a clip that keeps the laptop securely in place. It provides me with everything that I need in a backpack. </p>

 <p> Whenever I travel and I don't have any luggages, this is wha I use. Enough space for computer, camers, accessories and some clothes. Really good for carry on. No matter the weight fits very good on your back and you cannot fill the weight. </p>

 <p> I got this bag (very quickly, I might add) because I needed something to keep my Dell E1505 safe and secure.  As others have mentioned, the 15.4" widescreen laptop does just barely fit (you've gotta stretch the bag the tiniest amount to get the zipper around the upper edges).  At first I was worried, until I realized that there's space beneath the laptop carrier and the bottom of the bag.  That to me is a huge bonus, because it means that there's cushioning between the laptop and the ground if the bag is set down.  The padding is very, very nicely done, and since the laptop is actually on the wall of the pocket away from the "back" of the bag (ie, it's spaced from the part of the backpack that is against your back) you could add even more cushioning between the laptop and your back if you feel you need it (though with all the padding it comes with, I rather doubt you'd need to).My only complaint is the "open" pocket towards the front of the bag.  Just behind the first set of pockets (and there are sooo many pockets!!) is a sort of open area.  Other people have commented on how much they like this.  Personally, I'm worried that if I'm out int he rain with this bag, that pocket will collect water, which would then seep into the rest of the bag (not that the bag claims to be waterproof by any means).  I just don't see the need for it, but perhaps in time I'll find a use.Great bag for the money, well worth the price.In case it matters, the compartment for your mp3/CD player is lined in red.  It's the only portion of the bag which has red lining that I've found.  I thought that was kind of odd, thought I'd mention it. </p>

 <p> Ruggedly built, well-padded and with rather logical pockets. Someone put a bit of thought into this one, as opposed to the other ones I have seen where they figure more zippers and pockets are better (but that isn't always true, is it?)  Anyway, the silver-gray one is a lot less pricey than the red or blue ones, and once you get it in person you will wonder why you wanted the red one more - the silver-gray is sharp and much less gaudy than the red or blue.  My 15.4" Toshiba wide-screen fits snugly and I wouldn't try to fit any larger computer than that; it is snug enough so the computer won't move but not so much that you have to jockey the zipper around to clear it.  The compartments are useful and accessible when needed, with well-sized pockets and spots for mp3, phone, calculator, whatever. </p>

 <p> This is my second maxxum. I sold with my 1 week of use laptop, a friend fall in love with the laptop and the backpack. I can recomend enough this or every swissgear backpack, me and some partners have at least 1 model of swissgear, i'm a university professor so i must to move a little every day. Also you can put a wekeend clothes and your laptop in the same pack. And if you want a smaller computer back pack jus tight the belts around and will be just like a student pack. The multiple inside and outside pockets are awsome.Don't like just a laptop backpack it's a multitask backpack that also use to carry your laptop in a safely way (the latop puts suspend in a pocket, away from the floor). </p>

 <p> Got this to carry computer and other items between home and work and on plane trips. Computer protection and airport quick access is excellent. Room for other items is very generous. Quality and workmanship and back padding and computer padding is first rate. The chest straps are high, close to the neck - if I used them, they would be a deficit, but I don't find I need them. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Review from a Connoisseur  of Laptop Backpacks </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This is a good backpack, with some important things for people to know.  First of all and perhaps most important to people with 15.4" laptops, this backpack fits my average-sized 14.1" backpack snugly.  I would not want to try to cram anything more into the laptop sleeve than one of that size.  Sure, it may be possible to put a 15.4" one in there, but that defeats one of the reasons for a good laptop backpack -- the convenience of getting it in and out again.Appearance-wise, I find it to be pleasing.  The gray is lighter than the one in the picture.  The only thing I don't like about the appearance is that it tends to be a bit on the ... how do I say ... "very young cool" side -- overstated.  I would not choose this to bring a laptop into a corporate job for example.  It would look unprofessional in many corporate or formal settings.In addition to the laptop section not being sized very well, two other areas aren't.  Only small water bottles would fit into the side mesh pockets.  It seems designed for 12 oz cans of pop -- that's now narrow the opening is.  There is a nice pocket quick-access pocket on the top for items such as a MP3 player.  I find these kinds of pockets very useful for things such as a digital camera or even quick storage for things like pens.  Inside the quick-access pocket is a little pouch for an MP3 player.  When I put my 80g iPod in it, 2/3rds of it is still sticking out.  There would have been room for them to go up to an inch deeper.  I would be more likely to use this for extra batteries for a digital camera.  So there are 3 areas in which the sizes of the pockets are wrong.  Not something one would expect from what one usually expects from "Swiss" design.On the plus side, there are many pockets and areas in which to organize items.  They key would be keeping them all straight, but it's certainly much better to have more than fewer, and these extra pockets are sized very well.  The area for books is very large yet when books aren't in that compartment, the laptop seems to naturally compact, so that's an advantage from an appearance perspective.There is a book-sized compartment in the front of the laptop that is open on top.  A few other laptops have this, but the advantage of this one is that the sides of it are mesh and not just wide open, so it's a great quick-access area.  I love that feature.  THIS is the area where I would put a water bottle.  I can even fit my 14.1" backpack in there if I am going a short distance (like from one room to another) and know I will have the laptop vertically.The laptop compartment itself is very well padded, and there are "airflow" pads that keep the laptop away from the back so that air can flow through.The carry handle on the top seems very well reinforced.This is one of the better laptop backpacks out there.  I am docking it a star because in my opinion it's not for 15.4" laptops, and the water bottle areas (important for many, including myself) don't fit water bottles -- only cans of pop or something that size.  The price is right too, a great value.Update:  A reviewer for another color of this backpack said that she had two and that there was a difference in how the laptop area was made, and that is probably why there is a discrepancy between people saying this fits or doesn't fit a 15.4" laptop.  There is no way that mine would be able to fit a 15.4" laptop like the Dell 1505 / 6400. </p>

 <p> It's very good notebook backpack, the design and the pockets are exactly what i want it on my laptop backpack. But i see a litle problem with the size of the notebook pocket: i bought with this a toshiba satellite A135 15.4In. and match just exactly but you have to pull a little bit the swiper to close it. but still work and the swiper close very well. </p>

 <p> I waited a few months to write this review because I wanted to see how it held up. I have lugged a 6 lb laptop and probably 15 lbs. of textbooks a day for the last three months. The bag still looks new. Also, where the laptop goes is awesome! It really balances out the bag.UPDATE: July 11, 2011I just gotta say... this bag is STILL going strong! I can't believe I've had it so long!!! </p>

 <p> This is a sturdy backpack that will easily accomodate your 15.4" laptop. Pockets are plentiful and well made. Zippers are sturdy. Lots of storage and great padding. This will be our family's third Maxxum.The grey color is actually silver so the picture above doesn't accurately reflect how flashy the color is. So if you don't mind looking like one of the extras from an early eighties "Funkytown" video, it's a great choice. </p>

 <p> This bag is really strong and has a lot of cushion for laptops. But it's very heavy and big I wouldn't like to carry it around without my laptop. It occupies a lot of space even if there is no laptop inside. </p>
