 <p> Read in full on bus ride into work. Really has opened my eyes to new opportunities. Its a very personal story about how the author became a tutor and how you can do so to. I liked to book and the only disappointment was that I was looking for more. I suppose that's a good thing really. It kept my attention and I like her writing style. Would like a part 2 if there is one on some of the methods that were talked about. Well worth the money and will be on the look out for some more books by Victoria </p>

 <p> There is little in this book. However, I did find one useful advice on pricing. It is useful advice for parents to not simply focus on price when looking for a tutor. </p>

 <p> As a retired teacher, I've often thought about starting a tutoring business. I'm so grateful I found Victoria's book. Some of the details I found informative include: the ways of branding yourself so you can stand out from your competition, the formula to use for determining your price point and how to set up an online class. She also includes some excellent resources to help with online lessons and a tutor plan. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to start a successful tutoring business. </p>

 <p> I always thought that home tutoring would be difficult, but it isn't... well, it is, but this gem of a book makes earning a living tutoring from home child's play. The author takes you through her journey into the industry and then highlights many of the problems you may face and then offers up some great solutions to those problems.If you are considering a change of direction, or want to take up a career as a tutor then this book is a great place to start. </p>

 <p> Until I read this book, I had no idea that private tutoring was such big business (an estimated $5 billion globally). As far as home-based, freelance businesses go, this must be one of the most underhyped and less well-known. Even the author admits to have entered it "by accident" (word of mouth spreads when you're a terrific teacher). The author shares her knowledge and secrets (I particularly liked how she deals with potential clients who claim that they can't pay her asking price and want to bid her down; her answer to them can be applied to any similar business transaction) and not only covers how to choose subjects to tutor in but also the growing world of online tutoring which dispenses with having to confine your business to the local geography and the need for travel to conduct a face-to-face tutoring session. There's a lot to think about here in this compact guide. </p>

 <p> This book is a good, short read with some valuable tips. I would caution the reader to have a currency convertor neaby as this book mostly references the British pound. A bit of old english is also found throughout the book but neither this nor the currency thing takes away from its organizational flow. Finally, some of the advice found in here is also useful in starting a small specialty business in general. </p>

 <p> I'm always interested in learning about new business venture ideas. I've often thought tutoring would be a good option for me because I love teaching others new skills. Victoria Olubi has written an book on the topic that is packed with essential information. With Become A Private Tutor you'll earn everything from who makes a good tutor to what rates to charge. The best part is the plan worksheet at the end that allows you to move forward right away in planning your business. </p>

 <p> I would like to start the review by saying for anyone slightly interested in tutoring, this book is a must have. All aspects of tutoring people are covered in here from A-Z. What I really found helpful was how to market a tutoring business since I know I provide a great service, but unless I get the clients it doesn't matter. Another thing I found helpful was the workbook that enabled me to figure out which demographic I want to work with.The eBook itself was very easy to navigate through with links in the table of contents so anyone can go straight to the topic of preference. At the same time, it is formatted correctly with no visible spelling or grammar mistakes. </p>
