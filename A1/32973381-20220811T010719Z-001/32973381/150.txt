 <p> ...all part of the package that comes with a premium-priced portable Bluetooth speaker.The market is crowded with portable Bluetooth speakers. Many will deliver acceptable sound for most users, and even ardent audiophiles understand the limitations of physics as personal portable music relies on both a lossy format (.mp3) additionally impacted by the compression of Bluetooth audio streaming, all delivered to a small piece of hardware. But if you want to part with a few more dollars and up your overall wireless portable music experience, the features and sound quality of this speaker go a long way towards justifying its position at the higher end of speakers working in the same domain.Starting with what matters most: the sound. The SR20 offers the best sound I've heard from a wireless speaker...period. Whether acoustic, amplified, orchestral...whatever, the dual amps inside this speaker (which are no doubt responsible for driving its weight to more than 4.5 pounds) provide clear separation of frequencies (one drives bass, the other drives mid and high range frequencies). The speaker also contains two pieces of enhancement technology. The questionably named "Roar" button increases both volume and spatial/presence effects in a pleasing way (and the the expense of battery life). Also available is  "Terra Bass" function, which provides specialized bass treatment at lower volume levels (old timers will remember "loudness" buttons on systems from the dark ages).Bluetooth pairing was effortless with both an Android phone and an iPod Nano. The SR20 will pair with two devices simultaneously. Pause the content on one, start the content on the other and it instantly switches programming sources.This speaker is a also a digital music player via a microSD card. While it did not like the default file system directly imported from my Windows machine, once I reloaded the files outside of directory structure, it immediately recognized and played them. If you have a microSD card, this device also doubles as a voice recorder (saving files to the card in .wav files) for both spoken voice and phone calls. If your phone is the source of your music, it automatically pauses music and you can take your call via the speaker (assuming you want to share).Additional features include a bedtime mode (auto shutoff after 15 or 30 minutes) and an "alert" function that will intermittently increase the sound level, presumably to keep you from nodding off at your desk. It also has what might be the oddest function ever...a built in siren.Creative deserves extra credit for including outstanding user documentation. Both the quick start guide and more detailed user guides are nicely illustrated, well organized and understandably written.You can also integrate this speaker to be an output device from both Mac and PC computers via the included USB port. If your laptop has the sound quality of most laptops...the goodness of this idea is obvious.Keeping it one step from perfection was the puzzling decision to place many of the function buttons on the rear panel of the speaker. This is not an issue when you are controlling content from a connected device, but is rather annoying when playing from the SD card and you decide the time has come to skip forward or back. Overall, this is a minor gripe for a speaker that delivers major performance.Note: this item provided for review purposes. </p>

 <p> The Blaster's latest was sent to me as a 'for review' unit. Of course, they never hinted that a positive review as expected in return.The point of the attached imperfect video (sorry, had to take off for our vacation so I could only afford one take) should, I hope, help those interested decide which of the leading 'big sound' portable speakers they'd prefer, the 'competition' beingBose SoundLink Bluetooth Speaker III. Speaking for myself, while both are 'good', I found the Blaster's sound a lot more organic, so to speak. It's louder and more powerful too even on this recording, made with its 'roar' enhancement off.I hope the first part of the video puts to rest the charge advanced by some professional reviewer that the Roar bass is weak. It's not. But I'm not going to say words. Just listen and decide.Now, for what the video's image and sound don't show and still in a Blaster vs. Bose comparison mode, the Roar is smaller and lighter which is a good thing given that its sound is fuller and louder. It also lays down flat vs. Bose's stand up operating mode so the Blaster is more stable. The Blaster seems to be selling for a better price at the time I'm writing this.It also comes with lots of features, and I'm sure I'm going to miss some of them:- Long battery life: should last for about 8 hours, according to specs.- Charges either off its proprietary solution or, slowly, off a computer through the USB port.- Bluetooth: of course. The video was playing off a Bluetooth pairing with a Chromebook playing Pandora. It supports various pairing modes, including one that would allow TWO phones.- Phone support, no surprise there, with most functions implemented through tapping one button.- NFC (Near Field Communication): if your phone has it, you can play stuff off your phone by simply placing it near the Blaster.- Voice recorder: yes, it does that. The built-in mic will capture your voice and record it to a MicroSD card.- MicroSD playback: allows random play (my favorite) or sequential with the ability to skip to the next song or folder/album- Panic alarm: don't know who will ever think of pushing the panic alarm button on the Blaster rather than screaming 'Help' in a panic situation but... well... it's there.- Charger mode: believe it or not, you can use the Blaster to charge your phone through a USB portLike I said, I suspect I might have missed a feature or 2 but, in the end, what really counts in an external speaker is sound quality, portability, ease of operation and price and on all of the above Blaster's Roar is outstanding.Oh, of course, I forgot to mention the Roar button. It's what you use if you want to expand the sound to 'fill the room'. It works and it does seem to spread the sound around.P.S. My review mentions an attached video. I am attaching one but my experience with Amazon is that it sometimes takes them a day or 2 to post the video part so, please check later if the video is not there when you are reading this. </p>

 <p> Imagine having a speaker that can be connected via Bluetooth or NFC, via USB to a desktop PC or laptop, play music files from micro SD cards and even use it to answer calls and record conversations. How about allowing all your friends to share the Bluetooth connectivity.Those are just some a few of the great features. The Creative Blaster Roar has a built-in rechargeable battery. This means you can take it anywhere with you. Take it to the beach, the pool or be the best DJ at your friend&#8217;s party. Need more loudness&#8230;activate the ROAR feature and raise the loudness bar by another level. Don&#8217;t forget about the bass for those that want to feel their music with the TERA Bass feature. Activate both the ROAR and TERA Bass and immerse yourself in rich deep sounding tones.There is an alarm/siren, sleep mode and the unit will even charge your smartphone. I keep wondering where the mini television is hidden. This machine is truly one-of-a &#8211;kind and incredible to say the least.The design itself was given special attention. It lies down instead of up so the sound can be distributed uniformly. This also allows the bass and mid-ranges to sit low to cause less vibration and more stability.Once you hear the speaker in action, you will truly realize how much creativity and ingenuity went into designing this speaker.Review sample. </p>

 <p> Wow...that's about all I have to say.  Having no prior experience with BT speakers before now, I had relatively low expectations despite the glowing reviews.As one of the few reviewers who has actually purchased the speaker and thus has a bit of skin in the game, I can say that I am wholly pleased with this bluetooth speaker.  The overall performance and fidelity is exceptional and exceeds my expectations.While it won't be replacing my floor standing wired speakers, I can see where a pair of these set up in stereo format would create a very pleasing system suitable for many uses.Though I purchased the unit primarily for porch and deck duty, it sounds great in the kitchen and library as well.Thus far I've enjoyed music from disparate artists such as Charles Mingus, Donald Fagen, Simply Red, Lyle Lovett and Red Garland among others. They all sound great.None of my devices feature NFC but thus far I have had no difficulty mating the "Roar" with an iPhone, iPad, Kindle HDX and a Chromebook.I won't use many of the features provided on the "Roar" but for pure music enjoyment alone it is worth the asking price, imho.Highly recommended from a reasonably critical and picky listener. </p>

 <p> I've been a long time Creative customer since back in the Sound Blaster sound card days.  I've tried out a lot of wireless Bluetooth speakers and this one is near the best. And it's the cheapest out of all the best that I've tried. And the features are in abundance and it really shows that Creative knows how to do things right. It's just a really nice design with a lot of features that are super useful.The one feature I love and stands out is something I've never seen before, being able to record phone calls. I'm somebody who often wants to record a phone call especially when I'm calling customer service with a problem or complaint. A: because part of me wants to have a record of what we talked about for my own review. B: part of me was uploaded to YouTube if they treat me like a piece of trash. But I've never seen this option on a Bluetooth speaker before and it's just such a great thing to have. And records to your microSD card so that you can remove it and import it into your computer. It simply does the really shows creative put a lot of thought into how we might want to use the speaker.Another feature I find compelling and again a very unique feature for wireless speakers, multiple devices at once. With low-end speakers it's really annoying to have to keep pairing your device when you want to take over command. Special my friends are over and were sharing tunes. What's nice about the Sound Blaster Roar is that you can have more than one user paired at the same time to the speaker. Again another thing that shows Creative with the real thought into what the users want.The sound of the Roar is spectacular maybe not as good as the Bose speaker system I've used before but still pretty good by comparison. Definitely a great speaker you want to take it to a party/cookout/beach. It really does put out a lot of sound for a small portable device. It's rather impressive to see what Creative has crammed into such a small device.  A feature I did not get to try out is being able to run two speakers at the same time. To me you want to have sound usually spread across the room and running two speakers in parallel definitely will help saturate the area.What is NFC? Near field communication (NFC) is a set of standards for smartphones and similar devices to establish radio communication with each other by touching them together or bringing them into proximity, usually no more than a few inches.  I don't have NFC on any of my devices so I couldn't test it but I can't wait to get one because pairing via Bluetooth can be a pain in the butt. I'll test it out hopefully when the new iPhone emerges in the fall. But if it works as described as I'm imagining it does I can see myself using it all the time.So in conclusion I love this speaker. And it under $150 at the time of writing this review I think it stacks up against more expensive units by Sony and Boise and it has features that many of them lack. And this is perfect for cookouts with friends or trips to the beach really any time you want to have access to some musical entertainment.Thanks for reading!PS I really think a standout feature of this is the ability to record phone conversations.  This is something I wanted to do for so long and this provides an easy way to get it done. </p>

 <p> Update 14 July 2014: they have a white paper at creative.com/roar/whitepaper.pdfI have no doubt this is where I will put my money. 5 stars! ROAR!!!It is pointless to write another thumbs up review like what the overwhelming majority have done.Thus, for those who would like to look at its cons and how the cons may affect some, here they are:1) No audio volume indicator. It will be good to have some form of LED or even display.2) Too many features can confuse or up the learning curve. Some people just want the features simple, just do it.3) MicroSD Card support is only up to 32GB. If you have higher capacity, it may not work. My tiny 1GB card works.4) MicroSD Card needs to be formatted to FAT/FAT32. If you by chance have a NTFS one, it may not work.5) MicroSD Card playback lacks controls. You can play, pause, skip to next song, skip to next folder (by pressing and hold the forward button), random/continous play and that's all.You cannot fast foward play a song and so on. And yes, the buttons at the back are for controlling the card playback, not bluetooth. And you cannot use Bluetooth to control the card playback.Since the buttons are at the back, you could accidentally press back when you wanted to press forward.6) MicroSD Card playback does not support gapless. I know Windows Media Player since day 1 has support for it, same for a certain fruit company's products. My LG phone cannot play gapless too. If you need lossless audio, I am only in luck with wav. My WMA lossless does not work. My mp3 or wma 320kbps works.7) MicroSD Card playback is based on date/time the file is copied. FIFO. You cannot create a playlist. If you think you want to get this as a full featured jukebox, you might be disappointed. If you don't understand what is FIFO just use bluetooth.8) Bluetooth range is ok, but not always satisfying your expectations. My experience is the range is less than my wireless keyboard/mouse. If you are in an area full of bluetooth and wifi signals, good luck. If you keep on thinking about why the price is half of the competitor and why it is made in China, you may start losing confidence.9) If you looking at voice recording at 16bit 48kHz, you may want to ask Creative tech support how it could be done.10) Microphone to answer phone call is really ok, just ok only. A tad soft. If you have Soundblaster Axx 200, you will know what is the benchmark.11) To optimally and efficiently charge the roar, you will need to use the supplied AC charger, not any generic 5V 1A.12) Micro USB port is not very strong, just like Nexus 7 (2012). Take care if you plug in and out using USB cable daily.13) The device is a little heavy compared to speakers like Soundblaster Axx 200. If you are neither strong nor careful, let me know the drop test result. I have yet to.14) It is a rectangular box like device that occupies a large footprint compared to speakers like Soundblaster Axx 200. If you prefer a tiny footprint, do not get the Roar. To achieve optimal audio results, you may have to try positioning it near a wall, at a corner of the room and so on.15) Since it can connect to the desktop/laptop, you might think it can allow you to enjoy SBX effects on your favorite cans. There is no audio jack out. For gamers, there is no scout mode. Finally, changing SBX effects is not available through Android/iOS app.16) If you connect it to AC power and up the volume, you may find it louder than without AC power.17) If you find it too bassy, you might want to send it back for a refund. I have 2 suggestions. If you just want good mids/highs, small footprint/lighter/more features, better mic, get Soundblaster Axx 200. If you want to set it to neutral, connect to desktop/laptop, download SBX software (SoundBlaster Control Panel) and tune it.18) If you think it can outperform your 5.1 system/expensive soundbar, you will find its lack of stereo separation a regret. Solution is buy another Roar with the mega stereo cable to link up for wider soundstage. Note that the mega stereo cable is not an ordinary jack. It is slightly modified.19) The 6000mAh battery is non-removable, not user replaceable unless you are prepared to do soldering. My old Nokia feature phone battery is still working fine. Try to avoid draining the battery to zero too often, this can help to lengthen battery lifespan.20) The 5V 1A output can hardly charge large tablets. If you think of buying this just as a powerbank, think twice. After struggling to fully charge my LG Optimus Pro G (3140mah), it can hardly roar. Meow it goes.21) Battery life is ok, just plain ok. Nowhere near Soundblaster Axx 200. When battery life is low, it cannot output loud enough. You may want to buy a huge capacity powerbank for this.22) It is mainly dark gray in color. No other colors available including the accessories.23) Like any bluetooth device, you may have a device that is not willing to pair with it or you like to hear sudden pause in your music/audio.24) Like my Soundblaster Axx 200, you may have a certain laptop/desktop that somehow refuse to interact well with the Roar even after reinstall, reset, change micro USB cable and so on. Oh yes, older USB cables may not work well.25) It is not waterproof. The large horizontal top increases the probability of water invading the drivers.26) My Efergy power monitoring socket finds it consume more power during charging than Soundblaster Axx 200. 2 amplifiers means more power needed. To be fair, it still consumes less power than most 2.1 systems.27) No built-in FM tuner. So many features and yet this is missing. It was the standard in all Creative mp3 players (once upon a time...).20) No frequency response given. Doesn't matter. Certain frequencies are inaudible to humans. Give me a frequency response curve with SNR, that's better. You have a new fan and wants to know its rpm. I prefer to personally experience the wind (coverage, distance, timer, remote control) and noise from it during a hot afternoon.29) Creative is trying to make a comeback. Well, compared to some other brand that can sell very well even with twice this price, this brand still has some way to go. In fact, the Roar that you are getting today is like Roar 1.1 (some features added recently). I will not rule out a Roar 2 coming within a year that functions as a full jukebox too.I will update once I encounter new flaws.Last updated on 11 Jul 2014 :) </p>

 <p> I've had my hands on a lot of speakers over the years. I've always wanted that high end sound but could never afford the kind of speaker that produced it. I've come close with some shelf speakers but nothing ever came close to that concert hall sound at an affordable price. Until now. Sound Blaster has thought about just about everything that makes the listening experience amazing and easy.Sound: What can I say. It is AMAZING! It has two speakers in the front for high frequency sound (highs), a high excursion driver on top for bass and mid range sound, and two passive radiators on each side to enhance bass levels and widen the soundstage. What all that means is that it is so full and rich that it sounds like it is coming from a speaker grouping that is hundreds of dollars and much bigger. The technology inside is incredible.There are features built-in that make the sound even better when you need it. On top of the Sound Blaster is a ROAR button. That adds a super boost to the sound levels. Perfect for when you need to increase intensity without turning the volume way up and making it distort. Then there is a tera bass button. This is great for adding a little extra thump to your sound. I've been streaming radio and music of all kinds. The sound carries nicely to fill a room (the farther away the better sometimes) and I can hear it clearly across the house.Features: There are two ways to charge this, via the wall plug and USB. It seems to last a long time on one charge which means that portability is great. It has multiple inputs for music/sound. There is an audio jack (and audio cable - provided), a micro SD card, USB input, and bluetooth. It also will reconnect via NFC (near field communication) if you have already connected via bluetooth to your device. Just a tap from your phone to the corner of the speaker and it will auto connect.It has the ability to record as well. While I haven't tried this feature, it could be used to record a bedtime story for a child. This is great because it has a sleep function where it will slowly lower the volume for 15 or 30 minutes until it turns off.It has a built in alarm (not sure why but if you are camping or stuck somewhere and in need of a loud noise...) again, I haven't tried this out. I don't want to alarm the neighbors!Lots of features, amazing sound, compact size. And it comes with a carry case as well! This is well worth the investment.I was provided a unit for evaluation, testing and review. </p>

 <p> I'm a "get it out of the box and just plug and go" kind of guy and know that a lot of other people are also. Everything worked great (e.g., Bluetooth pairing) but I made the mistake of setting this speaker up on its side rather than as illustrated. Oddly, it still worked great especially on a hardwood table. But it is designed to sit horizontally. You've been warned!Sound quality: This speaker has some of the best dynamics I've heard from almost ANY speaker, with the only thing in question being its volume. Yes, it can still get hugely loud, but don't expect to have dance hall booming bass, especially in large rooms. That's not a drawback, in my book, rather it's a description of most portable speakers' capabilities. The most comparable speaker I've used prior to the Sound Blaster Roar would be theSony SRSX5which is similarly priced, but with a lot less features. If the specific features of the Sound Blaster Roar aren't needed, you might want to look into the SRSX5. Both can boom, but don't expect to use either in a club setting.Features: More than you'll likely ever need, but enough to have a ton of fun with. Some of the early reviews mention things that are no longer available (e.g., the mode that generates random sounds to keep you awake). Some features work better than others (ask in the comments and I can go in depth on individual features). I really like the ability to use this as a boombox by inserting a micro-SD card with your personalized playlist. Like other units with this feature, you don't have a lot of control, mostly just skipping forward or backwards. But, just make different playlists for different chips and you have your updated version of the 70's era cassette tape boom boxes.The ability to record incoming cell calls is VERY cool if you have that need and have found how difficult it can be to record cell calls. Just insert a chip, and when an incoming call comes in press the record button and you're set (all legal issues for your state on recording conversations are on you). Recording voice from the built-in microphone is just as easy. The microphone picked up my voice easily, as well as ambient noise from the kitchen about 20 feet away.Super fun unit with lots of bells and whistles; sound (if you don't need huge volume) is top of the line. 5 out of 5 stars.Sample received for review. </p>

 <p> The Creative Sound Blaster Roar puts out impressive audio for something so small, and not just impressive in volume, but in quality and in user customization, as well.There are two 1.5 inch high frequency drivers facing forward and a 2.5 in. midrange/bass driver directed upwards with bass ports on each end for a very deep and wide soundstage for a one-piece stereo speaker.  There are two dedicated amplifiers to support the very accurate and even sound reproduction.  There is no distortion even at higher volumes.However, the sound can be easily customized.  If a bass emphasis is desired, there are two buttons to adjust bass and the effect of overall intensity.  The TERA bass button increases bass dynamically at lower to moderate volumes and in rooms with poor acoustics.  The ROAR button boosts overall loudness and creates a more open sound and is very enjoyable even at close range.  These functions can be activated separately or simultaneously.Further customization is supported by the Sound Blaster Control Panel software when connected by USB cable to a computer.  The software provides nine preset profiles for music, films, and gaming, and these profile settings can be calibrated to taste.  It's a complete sound control panel but in software form.Bluetooth 4.0 with AptX and AAC codecs connects painlessly as "SB Roar SR20A" and will also support NFC connections.  Wired connections can be made to a computer either with the included USB cable or to any audio device with a 3.5 mm jack with an included audio cable.  Another option is using a microSD card to play MP3, WAV, and WMA files.  There is a built-in microphone that works well for calling and teleconferencing.  Other fun features include random loud sounds mode, bedtime mode, siren, and voice recorder.The large-capacity 6,000 mAh lithium-ion battery provides seven to eight hours of listening at normal volumes over Bluetooth and there is a 1 A USB port for charging small electronic devices, such as a paired smartphone.It ships in a nice frustration-free box that can be used for storage and includes a user guide.  It has a one year warranty.  Accessories available include aproprietary cablefor pairing and amesh carrying bagwith a shoulder strap and hand loop for portable use.It is difficult to compare the Sound Blaster Roar to other portable speakers because it is a big step up in audio quality and features from anything I have seen in its price range, making it an excellent choice for daily use as a primary personal speaker, especially where space is limited, as well as for portable use.  It is very handsome sitting on my desk and looks and feels much more expensive than it is.Creative provided a Sound Blaster Roar for evaluation and review. </p>

 <p> The Sound Blaster Roar is one of the most perfectly designed portable Bluetooth speaker system with so many extras, it tough to know where to begin. Creative has included so many cool extra functions I realized that I'll never have to have another portable stereo Bluetooth speaker again.These are some of the features that just blew me away.It pairs quickly with the push of a button.The sound is perfect. Absolutely. When I did maximize my phones volume and the Sound Blaster Roar, there was a bit of distortion, but I find this to be a good feature. It gives you the limit of its sound capability - and it is high. There are five drivers powered by two completely separate amplifiers! The bass is very strong and distinct with a built-in subwoofer. The bass comes out the sides and top, the mid-range shouts from the top along with some treble and the highs/treble comes out through two stereo speakers in the front. There is the &#34;ROAR&#34; button which is a booster. Your highs really become pronounced and the bass is slightly louder. The increase in clarity is what really stood out. It's almost overkill.It also works as a speakerphone, which is not unusual but the sound is perfect.There is a miscroSD card slot to store music and it can play MP3, WAV and WMA files. You can probably actually store more music on the card than on your Bluetooth device (32 GB). You can plug this into your PC directly and connect it over the USB and work it as a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). You can play music and charge it at the same time, saving battery power.There is a USB port that will charge a Smartphone, but this drains battery power, unless your unit is plugged into a power source. Easy enough!There is a siren/alarm that is activated by switching the speaker to the &#34;ARM&#34; control. This is part of the overkill, but someone will love this.There is a microphone if you want to record conversations or music/podcasts. To be honest, the sound recording quality of music is not that great, but calls come through great.The &#34;Roar&#34; is like a brick in size (2.2&#34; X 7.9&#34; X 4.5&#34;) and has a high-tech design of black and silver grills with easy to see and use buttons. It weighs about 2.5 pounds but there is a carrying pouch that wraps tightly around it so you don't have to remove it to enjoy sound/music (not included).The functions buttons are all on the top including, Power, Bluetooth/Call Answer/End, Volume Up/Down, and the powerful Roar mode. There is also a three-LED battery indicator light (small green lights) and lights for the Bluetooth and Roar mode.Around the back of the unit gives you a power port for a 3.5mm AUX input (adapter included). This is where the USB port exists for charging and the built-in 6,000mAh battery. This gives you up to eight hours of music, but if you play the Sound Blaster loudly, you will use the power up more quickly. Also, 6,000mAh alone will charge an average Smartphone about 2.5-3 times, so plug it in while charging your smartphone. There is also a small Play/Pause and Forward/Back buttons for songs along with a Record button and a microphone mute for sound recording. Did I mention the Loud Sounds switch, the Alarm arming switch or the Alarm button? It really is a welcome assortment of overkill.If you are going to spend the money for the Sound Blaster Roar, you will get your money's worth. The amount of functions and the audio performance are so well designed and constructed, I don't think anything else is out there that comes close. I am really impressed with this device. It's about time a company designed and produced a great multi-function Bluetooth speaker system that is actually affordable and worth every penny!Product supplied for a fair and honest review. </p>

 <p> The names Creative Labs and Sound Blaster are legendary among computer enthusiasts because they brought sound and especially music to computers. Early personal computers had no sound other than what was provided by a quarter-sized speaker only capable of making strange beeps and clicks people associated with old computers.The Sound Blaster quickly became the standard for adding high quality sound to the PC, first with an internal card and later using the USB connection. Sound Blaster is still THE name in PC audio cards with their high-end X-Fi Titanium product that they say can create three dimensional (3D) sound so accurate that gamers can locate their opponents by sound before they can even be seen.And now there is the Creative Sound Blaster Roar SR20A which redefines the simple Bluetooth speaker with five drivers including a built-in subwoofer. Power well beyond its modest size, the quality sound that sends music pumping out in seemingly every direction, filling surprisingly large areas with screaming highs and thumping bass, the speaker also has a number of well-executed, unexpected capabilities.I first heard about this speaker when a friend returned from the Consumer Electronic Show (CES) in Vegas last January. He said there was always a large crowd gathered around the Creative Labs booth where the new Roar was being demonstrated. He was impressed by what he saw and heard, but even after his slightly embarrassing gushing, I had no idea of all of the speaker's functions. After finally having one in my hands, and here is the list of everything it can do.Wireless speakerI use the Bluetooth 3.0 connection to play tunes from my iPod, tablet and laptop. The Bluetooth is seriously enhanced on the Roar, with 3 different Link Security (LS) modes controlled by a switch on the back,: connect two devices at once (LS mode 2, the default) and play one at a time, restrict to previously pared devices only (LS mode 1), or allow any device to grab control from the current device (LS OFF mode).It also supports near field communication (NFC) so you can connect by tapping the music player on the Roar. For conventional Bluetooth pairing, press the large tactile silicon button closest to the middle of the top of the unit (the multi-function button) and hold until the normally yellow light turns white and begins to blink. A voice says "Pairing mode, waiting for a device to connect."The other buttons on the top are plus and minus to control volume, the Roar button, and the power button. The Bluetooth is very powerful, connecting instantly to my iPod from 15 feet away and staying connected even when I took the iPod into another room. Bluetooth modes supported are: A2DP (Wireless Stereo Bluetooth), AVRCP (Bluetooth Remote Control), and HFP (Hands Free Profile) for phone use - see below.Hands-free phoneWhen the phone rings while connected to the speaker using Bluetooth, pressing the multi-function button will answer the call, with the caller's voice clearly heard on the speaker. The Roar's built-in microphone is sensitive enough to conduct a phone conversation while several feet away. Pressing the record button during the call will create an audio file copy of the call in the Voice folder of the MicroSD card. Holding the multi-function button down for two seconds or more when the phone rings, causes the call to be ignored.Electric guitar practice amplifierPlug the guitar into the AUX IN port and play through the Roar. I have only been able to do this before with other speakers by first connecting the guitar to another device (the iRig from IK Multimedia) and then to an iPod, and then to the speaker. Plugging directly into the Roar I can be playing in seconds without worrying about the daisy chain of devices hanging out of my guitar. The sound was excellent and plenty loud to work as a practice amp at home or on the road.Portable file storageConnected the Roar to a PC through the USB connection, and copied files to the MicroSD card inserted in the Roar. MicroSD class 4 and above cards are supported with capacities up to 32 gigabytes (GB) when formatted as FAT16/32 drives.Portable music playerUsing the MicroSD card created above, the Roar is a portable music player, using the controls on the back to skip forward or backward, play the WMA, WAV, and MP3 music song files randomly, or repeating them depending on the switch setting.Battery ChargerI charged my iPod and phone to full strength using the built-in 6,000 mAh (milliamp hours) battery through the DC OUT USB connection on the back of the Roar. One of the three battery strength lights on the Roar went out after the charging was complete, indicating that about 30% of the battery power had been used.Sleep or stay-awake aidPlayed music all day, switching between Bluetooth and MicroSD, then went to sleep with the Roar gradually reducing the volume and turning itself off. I also tried the stay awake feature that plays loud voices to startle you awake, which was annoying, but effective.Alarm SirenSwitching the alarm switch from Off to Arm and pressing the Alarm button starts a loud undulating siren. Not quite as loud as a true home alarm siren, it is still plenty ear-splitting. Slide the switch back to off to stop it. If you got lost in the forest, this would help rescuers find you quickly.Computer Audio SystemConnected the Roar with USB to a Windows PC with no speakers or audio drivers, and loaded the SoundBlaster control panel software from the website. The SoundBlaster control panel includes the SBX Pro Studio which enables the creation of sound templates that can be loaded on the Roar to tailor the sound to different sources and environments.There are 9 pre-made templates that will probably suit most needs without creating new templates. Templates are loaded to the Roar by clicking or touching them, it is as simple as that. My favorite for both music and video viewing is the Stadium Surround that uses special effects to trick your ears into hearing spacious surround sound that I find really enhances the experience.The other 8 provided templates are SBX Default, Warm Sound, Smart Volume, Dynamic Boost, Night Sound, Clear Dialog, Clear Comms, and Cinematic Action. Without the Roar, sometimes it is difficult, even with the volume cranked all the way up, to hear dialog and music from videos playing on my laptop. With it, there is enough headroom to blow the roof off.Sound EnhancementsPressing the Roar button acts as a loudness enhancer when maximum power is desired, such as in noisy environments. Using this feature seemed to significantly boost the bass and vocal range of the speaker. The manufacturer also recommends plugging in the power adapter which also provides extra volume compared to battery mode operation.There is also a "Tera Bass" mode that, if desired, boosts the bass levels at lower volumes. It is activated by pressing the Alarm button on the back of the unit while the music is playing. While the bass did seem slightly over emphasized using this feature, I liked it, though that is purely subjective, dependent upon the user and type of music being played.AccessoriesA Mega Stereo Cable is available, allowing two Roar speakers to be used together, with the Master left speaker controlling the right speaker as a slave. And, a mesh carrying case permits the speaker to be easily transported and the mesh panels permit it to be played without removing the case or muffling the sound.The Roar has joined my cell phone, iPod, and PC as essential technical devices used throughout the day. The quality, seemingly endless features and reasonable price make this device beyond impressive. Opportunities are continually presenting themselves to put it to use to improve the experience of whatever activity is occupying my time. There is no going back.Review unit provided by Creative without obligation. </p>

 <p> I am not an acoustical expert nor a musician or a DJ. But I know what sounds good to my ears. And this speaker sounds fantastic! I've listened to popular, R&B and jazz and all of them sounded great! The highs were crisp and the lows were clear. The other features worked great too. When using my phone text messages and phone calls worked flawlessly. I've yet to use all of the features since I've only had the product a few days but I expect them to work great as well. I usually wait a few months before reviewing a product but with this being new I thought I would write one to give those on the fence an objective opinion. If you purchase this you won't be disappointed. But if anything changes I'll follow up this review. </p>

 <p> [Please read this review for full details and watch the updated video for an illustration of the various audio modes]After having owned and listened to more portable Bluetooth speakers than I can count, it's hard to put a finger on what sounds "good" vs. what sounds "impressive". I have speakers all over my house so I never have to carry one with me, and I'm trying to learn which ones sound best in which rooms and for which types of music. I own a specialty speaker all-in-one that is not in the size/price category of Bose, Jawbone, Creative or any of the ones that can fit on the palm of your hand that I keep it in my den and for an all-in-one unit the sound it produces is just magical. It's 20x larger than the Roar and 3x the price but the Roar sounds amazingly good in direct comparison. The size of the Roar, by the way, is only 2.2" x 7.9" x 4.5" and weighs just 2.5 lbs.Let's get the suspense out of the way ... the Sound Blaster Roar not only causes you to drop your jaw in disbelief, it is also very listenable over the long term with practically any music genre. Due to the driver arrangement, the width and depth of the soundstage when listening in a typical interior room and side-by-side with a Bose Wave radio is virtually identical. In fact I like it better than any of the other palm-size speakers I have tried, and yes that does include Bose. So much so that as of now this is the one that will travel with me to make boring hotel rooms come alive with music or videos played on my iPad sound more like I'm listening to them on my home surround system.There's no need to dwell how good this speaker sounds, the only way you will really know how it sounds is to listen to one live in-person using the music you like, at the volume you like, in the room you will use it the most. If it pleases you, it is the right choice for you. If you don't like the sound, it's time to return it and move on. There is simply no other way to know if this is the right choice for you.So, how about other things like how well it is constructed, controls, battery life, etc?Let's start with first impressions. There are certain products that are appropriately to referred to as "crafted" rather than manufactured, like a Bentley, a Rolex or a finely tailored suit. They stand out in their design from other products of their genre. That is the first impression of the Roar, it looks and feels much more expensive than it is. It is knock-dead beautiful. Most of the inputs/outputs, switches and levers on the Roar are gathered together at the back of the unit where they would not normally be seen.The controls are well-labeled however and very unlike Bose are not all monolithically and monochromatically lined up and hard to read. They are in fact class-leading in the ease in which a new user can quickly learn to operate the speaker without an instruction manual.But don't throw that instruction manual away just yet. While the basic controls are easy to figure out, some of the functions they perform are a little more obscure. Like being able to record sound from its built-in microphone to a micro SD card or performing as a high-quality speakerphone (whose audio can also be recorded). You can also set it to be able to accept sound from two different Bluetooth devices at once and instantly switch back and forth between them. Of course, you can't play both simultaneously. There's also the ability to set a sleep mode that gradually reduces the output volume as a user falls asleep.As you read the various reviews about the Roar you will see references to two very unusual functions (usually accompanied by a snicker). One is the Life Saver mode which was intended to play random odd sounds to help keep you awake. I say "was" because that feature has been replaced on the brand-new release model of the Roar, which is now the SR20A, with a new function called Link Security which has 3 modes. The first gives you a private Bluetooth connection so no one else has access to your Roar. The second allows you to share Bluetooth access only with your friends. And the third is a "free for all" mode where anyone can tune in and play jams on your Roar. This seems to be something teachers will appreciate ... they can let classmates share their input into one sound system or activate the private mode so only they have access.The other new feature of the new Roar SR20A (sold after July 4, 2014) is Terra Bass, which shares the siren button. The Terra Bass button intelligently boosts bass when audio levels are low in a way similar to the loudness switch on some stereo amplifiers. Terra Bass and the Roar button can be used independently or together. If you activate them at high volume levels the result is impressive but sounds over-processed in a way similar to the Bose Mini. Unlike with the Bose, however, with this speaker the effect can be turned off. Not to worry, the siren button is still there, and can be turned on/off with a slide switch. Educators/business trainers/meeting leaders will like the Roar as a portable and very loud device to amplify the output of video/data projectors. Because of the multi-input capability they can also run music during the break and even call the attendees back together using the loud siren button.The Roar breaks from the mold in terms of its overall design in that it is intended to lay flat like a cigar box. That has some intended yet unusual positive consequences one of which is with the subwoofer pressing the unit downward it does not have a tendency to "walk", in other words many of the other similar speakers, when playing at high volume, will creep backward. Yes, I've actually have one fall off of a table.The Roar has a total of five drivers and two amplifiers. A large central active excursion driver and its associated two passive radiators on each end powered by its own amplifier plus two 1.5-inch high-end drivers are powered by another amp. The speakers are aimed in three different directions to fill a room with sound creating a wide and realistic soundstage instead of creating specific sweet-spots. Sound quality, especially the bass frequencies, is very subjective. For that reason it's wise to be wary of reviews that over-dramatize the reviewer's personal impression of the sound of ANY speaker system as being "the best" or "weak bass" or terms like that. What applies to that particular listener may not, and probably will not, apply to you. The ONLY way to know if you will be able to live with the sound of a speaker is to audition it, either in a store, or preferable at home. If you buy from any reputable vendor they will allow you to return it if you hate the sound. For that reason I strongly recommend that you do not base your final judgment on any review, mine included, but only use them as a guideline.As far as the rest of what you should know - not only does the case look classy, it looks like it is relatively durable. It is constructed in subtle shades of dark gray with contrasting brightly chromed end and non-slip silicone textures including a silicone-padded surface to protect furniture and prevent slipping. The speaker as tested does get about 8 hours on a charge on its 6,000 mAh Li-ion battery.Creative is a reputable company and my dealings with them have been positive; it is possible to get through to real humans. They kindly provided an initial sample release unit for testing, but be assured all opinions are mine. At the price point this speaker, in my opinion, it could compete on an equal footing with brands like Bose, Klipsch and others and frankly I think it could compete with speakers priced at $299 equally well. Instead it is being sold for 25% less than the Bose Mini.I don't believe in comparing speakers by pointing a video camera at them. First off, the built-in microphones in 95% of home video cameras are very  low-fi. Maybe more important than that is that speakers "emit" sound in different ways. The Bose Mini for example emits the majority of its sound from the front, if you walk around to the back of the speaker the quality of the sound changes dramatically. The Roar, on the other hand, emits sound from the front, top and both endcaps. Pointing a camcorder at the speaker will only "hear" the part of the speaker the camera is pointed at which is nothing at all like what you will experience in a typical listening setting. That being said, the accompanying video is not intended to judge or compare the overall sound quality, but rather to give you the opportunity to hear the difference between the 4 audio modes while listening to the same audio track. For that comparison professional studio microphones were used.Here's a checklist of the features, some of which were not detailed here:1. Currently selling at Amazon for $149.992. Bi-Amplified design3. Roar for instant additional audio power4. Bluetooth with aptX and AAC music streaming5. Digital USB connectivity6. Analog mini plug connectivity7. Integrated WMA/MP3 player using microSD/micro SDHC card8. NFC technology9. Multipoint technology to permit simultaneously connecting two Bluetooth devices10. Capable of charging a smartphone as an emergency backup11. Bedtime mode gradually reduces volume as you fall asleep12. Built-in audio recorder13. High quality speakerphone with record capability14. Helpful subtle voice prompts (which can be turned off)15. Downloadable Sound Blaster control panel for PC/Mac with pre-defined audio profilesIn summary, portable Bluetooth speakers are one of the most popular consumer electronics accessories lately, and there are countless shapes and sizes, some from well-respected manufacturers and many from no-name companies. Some sound great and some sound terrible. Some have an impressive first impression but are not musically pleasant for long-term listening. One of the best known for the past year or so has been the Bose Mini which certainly ticks all the boxes when it comes to design, build quality and impressive sound in a small package. The Sound Blaster Roar is a worthwhile competitor that looks and sounds like it should cost more not less than the Bose. If I had both of them before me and only could keep one and it was agreed that they both sound great I wouldn't hesitate to choose the Roar for at least two reasons ... one, that it is not as directional, making it less picky as far as placement and more definitely suitable for outdoor use. And two, the Roar is just more versatile.[Added a week later] - wanted to share a cool use of the Link Security feature. We had the Roar set up at an outdoor barbecue where each person loaded the songs they wanted to hear using their smartphone. We were able to replicate the concept of those old-time juke boxes where people would insert their money and pick a song or two and then the juke box would play the songs in sequence for the night while you waited for your "favorite" to play. Our experience was very similar except as each song ended the next person had to try to "beat" the others by being the first to hit Play because Bluetooth can only play from one device at a time (but the Roar can be linked to the whole gang's phones).All things considered I believe Creative has scored a winner and earns a solid 5-star rating. </p>

 <p> Bluetooth speakers have improved a lot over the past couple of years, but I never thought I'd hear one that sounds this good, especially at this size and price range. This speaker has a solid, substantial look and feel. It has 5 drivers and a built-in subwoofer so it also sounds substantial and solid. The sound fills our kitchen/family room/dining area which is around 45' x 24' with bump outs for a dining area and lots of windows and doors, and 10 foot ceilings. Yeah, it's an acoustical nightmare. But the ROAR fills this Great Room with crisp, clear sound and amazing bass. People that walk into the room invariably ask where the sound is coming from and have a hard time believing this little device is ROARing out this amazing sound!I know that Creative has a solid reputation in the area of sound. My very first purchase of a computer add-on 2 weeks after buying my first computer was a Creative Sound Blaster sound card which I installed, with their instructions, having never seen the inside of a computer before. And it worked right away! So I became a loyal customer, installing several of their sound cards over the years. I'm glad they have reinvented the Sound Blaster in some of these new products.This speaker has a bi-amplified design meaning it has dual opposing sound radiators with five drivers. These disperse frequencies forward while the active bass unit disperses midrange sound upward for height while the side firing radiators deliver the bass that fills the room, even a large one like ours which is a real challenge for any speaker system let alone a single speaker such as this. Walking into this room you would never suspect such room filling sound could accomplished by this little device. This not only sounds great &#34;for its size&#34; but for any size. It sounds a whole lot larger than it actually is.Besides it's amazing sound the Sound Blaster Roar has a bunch of other great features. It has a high-quality microphone for clear voice pick up, making useful for speakerphone teleconferencing or just answering your smart phone. It has integrated MicroSD, WMA MP3 players meaning that you can play music directly from a microSD card without having to connect another device. (You can also connect a device with a cable with 3.5m connectors.) It has an integrated voice recorder, with one touch audio recording of voice calls of music directly to a microSD card. If you have an NFC enabled device you can connect it via Bluetooth. You can also connect two Bluetooth enabled devices at the same time. There are lots of link security modes so you can control how Bluetooth devices are able to connect the ROAR.It comes with a plug-in battery charger and provides about eight hours of continuous audio playback. You can also charge your smart phone with it. You can connect via USB to a PC or Mac computer. SoundBlaster Control Panel software is available for free download that will enable advanced audio processing. A lot of thought and engineering went into this speaker and it shows. Quite simply, the best Bluetooth speaker I have heard so far. Two thumbs up!I received a sample of this speaker from Creatve for testing and review. </p>

 <p> Disclosure: I received a free sample of this item to review by virtue of being a frequent Amazon reviewer. I rarely accept such invitations, but I did here because frankly, I wanted to know if this was a good bluetooth speaker. The verdict is: YES! The sound features crisp trebles and rich bass sound that comes together for a very pleasant listening experience. We rocked with this for several hours and still had 2 of 3 LEDs going, so the battery seems to be quite good, which is important since for me the whole point of a bluetooth speaker is portability.  My son has reported getting about 8 hours of service out of this speaker on one charge.  This is a terrific speaker for backyard barbecue parties and the like.This unit is beautifully made -- no one can fault the fit-and-finish here. You can play music directly from your computer through this speaker, from a MicroSD card (there is a slot for this) or do what I usually do and stream music from your iPhone or iPad. This little speaker does it all.For the price listed on Amazon this speaker is competitive for best of class. The sound is as good as my Bose Mini, and better than my Jambox. Creative is going to sell a zillion of these at these prices. RJB. </p>

 <p> My short review:If you have the money to spend on this speaker, don't walk, RUN to the order button and just buy it. This is easily the best sounding portable speaker I have ever heard, and if you pair them it is likely the sound from these two devices will trounce what most normal people usually listen to music on at home.I have heard several Bose options from the higher end BT speaker side, and countless BT speakers from the low end side from all sorts of vendors. This is the first time, in all my testing, that I can say that the price belies the tremendous capability of this speaker.Very highly recommended.Longer review:Creative Labs was the audio darling of the PC sound card world. Their cards were top of the class, providing advanced features and capability that PC gamers and audiophiles craved. Then Intel and others begin including audio components on their motherboards and chip sets, and Creative lost their way. The mighty fell.Thankfully, they have soldiered on, continuing to provide top of the line audio cards and audio capability to computer users, but at a lesser capacity than their heyday. Now they are focusing on other areas of audio, and this speaker is just one of the areas they spent a ton of research and development time/resources to make it sound nothing short of amazing. And they succeeded, hands down, making me realize how much I miss the old days of PC building...The sound from the Roar Portable Bluetooth Speaker is nothing short of amazing. I received a free sample from Creative for review purposes and wasn't overly excited by the idea of reviewing yet another Bluetooth Speaker. But then it arrived, I opened it and connected it to my computer and... my jaw was on the floor. I have never been this surprised by a BT speaker in my years of reviewing on Amazon.Opening the box, you don't get the "Apple Ecstasy" of a premium product opening. To me, that's not a huge deal, but the feeling of wow of unboxing could match the absolute feeling of WOW when you power it on and hear how amazing it sounds.There are a ton of ways to provide audio to the speaker, they include:Bluetooth (you can connect up to 2 devices at a time, though only one will play audio obviously)NFC (if you aren't aware, NFC is just an easier way to connect BT devices that support it)3.5mm inputMicroSD (up to 32 GB capacity only, higher capacity does NOT work, I tried)USB input to your computer as a USB sound card (this offers a ton of control for your audio if you choose this option)Added features:You can charge your phone w/ the built in battery via USBThere is an "alarm" feature for getting people's attentionBluetooth is using BT 3.0, instead of BT 4.0, but don't let that fool you, it still sounds amazing and supports A2DP (can also be used as a speaker phone).The audio out of this single speaker is nothing short of amazing. Highs are high. Lows are low. Mids are mid. It sounds exactly what you should expect from a high quality speaker.Part of why this sounds so amazing is that it utilizes two amplifiers. One amp is focused on lows and mids. The other is focused just on providing accurate highs. At max volume, there is no distortion. And the amount of bass from this, when it is sitting on a flat surface, is quite thumping. There are essentially 3 speakers in the box. Two are 1.5 mm and a single down firing 2.5 mm driver that is designed to pump out bass. The grills on the side are designed to throw the bass around, and filling a room with sound is an easy proposition.When using the Roar, be sure to place it on a flat surface with the power button facing UP. This will ensure audio plays back correctly in terms of audio quality. It CAN play in other configurations, but the problem there is that you really change the acoustics, and in the case or putting the power button facing down, the sound becomes harsh. Most people wouldn't do this, so I'm just mentioning it, just in case.I am, right now, placing an order for a second speaker to use this is true stereo mode. Just the quality from a single speaker is this good, I can only imagine how great it will sound with the stereo feature working.Features:SpeakerphoneVolume up/downPower on/offmic input for recording audio to MicroUSB (and a built in mic for speakerphone that can be used to record audio notes and record calls)LS1 and 2, plus the off switch just allow 1 or 2 devices to connect to the speaker, turning this off allows everyone to pair with itTerrabass (also works as the siren button) for more intelligent bass as you turn the volume down, similar to night or midnight mode on a stereo or surround receiverRoar mode turns on a loudness option. You lose audio fidelity with this setting, but in a party setting you won't notice and it will toss sound more fully and completely around the room....Playback time from the battery seems to be in the 6-8 hour range for me. If you connect your phone to charge, and if you are using Bluetooth for connectivity, expect lower battery life. If you are using this at maximum volume, expect the battery life to be lower.Overall:In the end, at the current Amazon price, this speaker's audio quality is impossible to match elsewhere for even $50 more. It is also packed with features. I can't wait for my second speaker to arrive to test this is stereo configuration.Very. Very. Highly recommended.(As stated, I received a free sample from Creative for review purposes, and now I'm purchasing a second)Pros:Great sound for the priceTons of connection and playback optionsLoudness (Roar) button helps fill a packed room with soundGreat build qualityCons:Battery life can take a beatingPlacement certainly helps to ensure proper audio responseWhen using the stereo option (2 Roar speakers together), you can only playback via BT/NFC, USB to a computer or MicroUSB (disappointing IMO, since I would love to connect this to my AUNE amp with this configuration)For those wondering what I listened to via this speaker (this is over BT and connected to my PC through my AUNE and a 3.5mm cable):Pink Floyd - Wish You Were HereHalo Combat Evolved AnniversaryHalo Combat EvolvedSeveral Mozart piecesDavid Bowie - Space Oddity/Earthling/Ziggy Star DustMoody Blues - Days of Future PastHikaru Utada - Various tracksGuns N Roses - Best ofDerek and the Dominoes (Eric Clapton)Lord of the Rings Complete Recordings (various tracks from the 3 sets)UrusenTrans Siberian Orchestra - Dreams of FirefliesCannibal Corpse - various tracksNapalm Death - various tracksEverything sounds great. I prefer my B&W; 683s through my receiver, but from my computer, this is more than good, it's great.EDIT 15/7/2014 - I have found that if you have a USB cable connected to your ROAR and you then use the stereo input, you may hear some buzzing interference. I solved this by simply unplugging the USB cable while using the speaker w/ stereo in.Also, I purchased a second ROAR to test the stereo capability. Unfortunately, the Mega Stereo Cable isn't available from Creative in the US yet. And you can't order from the Singapore site (which has it in stock). I tried a standard 3.5mm to 3.5mm stereo cable, it doesn't work. I tried a Beats audio cable (the Creative picture shows 3 connection points, so I thought maybe a mic cable would work). This didn't work either.EDIT- the Roar "Mega Stereo Cable" is now available and I have had the absolute pleasure of hearing 2 Roar speakers roaring in unison. The effect is nothing short of phenomenal. The inner audiophile inside of me is all sorts of tickled and amazed at just how great one speaker sounds, and how much BETTER it sounds with two. Don't get me wrong, you don't NEED 2 Roar speakers to get some fantastic music, but just know that you CAN connect 2 and get sound that will truly knock socks off and give true stereo sound.I am now anxiously awaiting Creative listing the Mega Stereo Cable on their website so I can order it. If the effect isn't awesome, I'm sending the second speaker back and will eat the cost of the Mega Stereo. I'll update my review once I have the ability to test this out.EDIT- I received the Roar Mega Stereo Cable today. I've been listening intently for quite some time and I have to say, just as I edited within the review proper, the sound is absolutely fantastic. Very, very impressive. I wish you could connect analog to the master speaker and have it play, but coming over the USB connection to my PC, and via BT on my phone, I don't hear any issues at all. If you have the means, two Roars are better than one, and one alone is still nothing short of phenomenal. </p>

 <p> The Creative Sound Blaster Roar has a powerful sound in a relatively small and easily transportable package. Recently I have had the opportunity to test and review many different Bluetooth speakers and there is definitely a wide range in both quality and sound performance. The Sound Blaster Roar is at the top of the list for performance. While I do not consider myself an "audiophile" I do love music and listen to music often. One of the problems I have encountered with many of the other units is a significant lack of bass. The Sound Blaster Roar delivers in the bass department and did not disappoint. Additionally, many units have a distorted sound at higher volumes but I did not encounter that with the Roar.Aspects about the Creative Sound Blaster Roar that I like include:+ Stylish+ Excellent build quality and durability+ Very detailed and specific user documentation+ Battery provides up to 8 hours of music before it needs to be recharged+ Small and light enough to easily transport (Comes with a carry case)+ I have not experienced any connectivity problems+ Sound is superb to include bass, treble, low, mid, and hi ranges. The sound is also very clean and distinct with no distortion even at a high volume.+ Set up and connectivity to the Bluetooth was very quick and easy (less than 1 minute)+ Provides a large, deep, and rich sound in a multidirectional manner so that your music fills the room+ Provides a lot of functionality such as: MicroSD card slot for your music, microphone to record conversations, can charge your Smartphone, bedtime mode that gradually fades volume,and moreOverall Assessment:Sound is a very individualized experience and depending on your expectations, hearing, likes/dislikes, environmental factors, room size, etc. your experience with this unit may be different. For me, I find the Creative Sound Blaster Roar exceptional. Actually this unit performs exceptional at any price point. I have used other Bluetooth speakers in this price range that do not come close to the sound and functionality of this speaker. You may ask, "Are there better speakers available?" and the answer is yes but those units will be much more expensive and generally larger. I am confident when I state that you will not find a better speaker at this price. I will be using this unit on a daily basis. While you may not need all the functionality that the Sound Blaster Roar provides you will be more than happy based on the sound alone. Highly recommended.Item provided for review purposes. </p>

 <p> Move over Bose, JBL and Klipsch! There's a new portable Bluetooth speaker and it's nothing short of amazing what this book-sized speaker sounds like. If you're on the fence this summer in deciding what to get, you need to go ahead and buy the Creative Sound Blaster Roar. It's the best speaker right now on the market. It's big enough to fill a room with sound but still portable enough to take with you to a friend's house, on vacation or business trip. It's looks awesome and sounds amazing. Five out of five stars!Why buy *this* portable Bluetooth speaker?This is what you need to consider when buying a portable speaker these days: Sound volume and fidelity, build materials and construction and (most importantly for your pocketbook) value and price.Here's why I own a Sound Blaster Roar:I set this up in my bedroom and streamed music from Google Play, and I had the Roar set up on my nightstand, behind me. I was immediately impressed with not only the VOLUME of sound, but the actually CLARITY and DEFINITION of what was being played. How can a book-sized speaker fill-up a room and sound so incredibly clear??!?If you're an audio nerd you'll know this is why this speaker is so amazing. If you want to cut though all the marketing hype with other speakers and want to buy the "best" portable speaker on the market today, the information below is what you need to compare to other speakers in this class:The Sound Blaster Roar is one of the only portable speakers that uses TWO SEPARATE AMPLIFIERS. One amp in the Sound Blaster Roar is dedicated for high-end frequencies (cymbal crashes, flute sounds and female vocals) and another amp is dedicated to the low-end frequencies (bass guitar, kick drum, thunder sounds.) This is why the ROAR sounds so great! Other battery-powered speakers use a passive system (with only one amp for both high and low end) while the Sound Blaster Roar uses and ACTIVE system that uses two separate amplifiers for some of the best sounding music you'll ever hear.Have you ever heard someone say "It's like listening to my music for the very first time?" Well, that's the best way to describe the quality of sounds I was hearing from this speaker. All the instruments and singers were separated in the songs and I could actually hear subtle nuances ( a singer taking a breath, a pick sliding over a guitar sting) I was so impressed that I quit working for a while just to enjoy what I was hearing!There is a "Roar" button that acts not only as a loudness button, but also increases the dynamic range of what is being played. It's nice to use when you are at a party or at a place that has a bit of ambient noise. The Roar button helps compensate for the external noise and does a great job without adding any hiss or muddiness to sound. Other speakers don't have this kind of technology, so this is just another great reason as to why I'm such a fan of this speaker.There's a lot of junk on the Amazon masquerading as "quality-built" portable speakers. Trust me, I've owned a few zonks. Have you ever picked up something and it just felt cheap and poorly made? The Sound Blaster Roar feels well-built and expensive to the touch. It has a tasteful matte-grey alloy for the speaker grill, with smoked-chrome accents around the side speakers. For sound control, there is a smooth, rubberized button area on the top and around the I/O ports in the back. The unit has a nice balanced heft to it, but it's not overly heavy or unwieldy to carry around. It really looks nice, and due to neutral coloring of the materials, it looks fine on any counter-top, nightstand, coffee table or executive's desk. It's very well-built.There are also some really cool "James Bond" features, which add functionality you just don't get with any other speaker. You might not use them all the time, but they might fall into a category of "glad to have it and not need it."James Bond Add-ons: It has very loud and attention-getting siren function,  it's also a cell phone charger, it has a built-in MP3 player, support for a Micro SD card, AUX IN (1/8) built-in microphone (for recording) and a Bluetooth feature that lets TWO people control the speaker at one time from two different Bluetooth devices. You can also hook this up (via USB) and use it as your computer's primary speaker system.Believe me when I say this (and I am very selective about quality) there is not a portable speaker on the market today that offers these same features for the price. However, the overwhelming deciding factor for ownership should be sound quality and fidelity, which this speaker delivers!  If you can put your hands on one and hear it, you'll see that this sounds better than other "premium" portable speakers out there for 3x the cost. If you are still undecided, look at the other 5 star reviews for this product.If you're on the fence and are looking at other audiophile-grade portable speakers, you just can't pass up the Sound Blaster Roar. I've owned other Creative products (including the AXX) and Creative just keeps raising the bar with products like the Sound Blaster Roar. It's their best speaker to date! </p>
