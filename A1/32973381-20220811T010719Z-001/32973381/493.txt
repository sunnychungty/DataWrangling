 <p> This book was very good.  I can relate to a lot of what Lakea went thru in this book.  The story line is consistent. It held my interest n this authors style of writing is very very good! Once I start a series got to finish it. Hoping part 2 is good. </p>

 <p> So I'll start off by say it's only so much a character should have to go through so this really should be the last one. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Make this the last one </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> The first two books were good.  However, number 3 was not realistic.  There were too many grammatical errors in all the books.  To be a success, make an effort to get a proofreader.  Just because this is urban fiction,  readers should not be shortchanged.T </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Unrealistic </p>

 <p> 4.5 Stars....from one bad incident to the next. Was this broken girl deserving of all that was happening to her or did she will it. Sometimes prays can clear our journey. Throughout her ordeal she was still able to come out on top with a little happiness. I say if your not death and you have life and breathing then there is still time for happiness and laughter. Lakia put her best effort out there and ended with lots of love I was truly happy for her. </p>

 <p> Never has a sequel held my attention this long. Thank you finally having a sequel closer to real life. Where the person has some points of peace and then goes through storms. I loved all 3. </p>

 <p> This was a plot that kept me interested from beginning to end.  Loved going through the highs and lows of Lakea.  After three books and all she has been through why can't she just be happy.  I really don't think a fourth book is called for, however if it is written it better be off the meter to end Lakea's happiness and keep me as a fan. </p>

 <p> Awesome </p>
