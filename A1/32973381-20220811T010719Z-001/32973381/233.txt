<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone is a film about need and seduction and the fear of being all-alone in the world. Legendary New York stage actress Karen Stone (the legendary Vivian Leigh) is unhappy with her latest performance, and is even more distraught when the play turns out to be a flop. She decides to retire from acting, telling everyone she needs a holiday to take care of her ailing husband.However, when he dies on board a jetliner on the way to Rome, she decides to stay in the City and book herself into a lavish rooftop apartment. She wonders the streets, drifting in a haze of expensive loneliness, wondering what to do with her life now that acting is over for her.  She soon falls in with the Contessa (Lotte Lenya), a female pimp, and a sharp procuress of handsome young men for forlorn wealthy old widows.The Contessa hooks her up with the young Paolo di Leo (Warren Beatty). The sexy Paolo thinks nothing of acquiring money out of rich, older women, and with the Contessa's encouragement, he wines and dines Karen. Karen, however, isn't your typical widow. At around fifty, she's is still very beautiful, although she worries about getting older, she's obviously enamored of Paolo and she's desperate for affection, but she's determined that Paolo's need for money will not triumph her need for love.They eventually become lovers. Karen showers gifts upon Paolo and they take a trip to Tangier. The Contessa becomes furious that Paolo isn't "cutting her fifty-fifty on the deal." Karen also doesn't heed the warnings of her friend, journalist Meg (Coral Browne) that she has "a disease" that can't be fulfilled. When Paolo begins to make the movies on younger starlet Barbara Bingham (Jill St. John), Karen begins to see Paolo for what he really is.Based in Tennessee Williams novella, Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone is full of his trademark themes of desperation and isolation of fearful people aching to connect. There's no doubt that Paolo is an attractive man, but he's also selfish, spoilt and petulant and he thinks nothing of two-timing Karen. Karen is an intelligent and intuitive woman, and she's well aware of Paolo's agenda, but it's as though she's observing life through a looking glass, and is ultimately seduced by the gigolo lifestyle.Director Jos? Quintero bathes the movie soft hews of gold and orange and he makes the most of Rome's stunning surrounds. Vivien Leigh remains a rather downcast presence - she's plays Karen with a fascinating mixture of neurosis and foreboding, she knows the relationship with Paolo will probably lead nowhere but she just can't help herself.When their romance starts to sour, she and her young and deceitful companion trade sharp words but there no extravagant theatrical exchanges. Likewise Beatty plays down the truculent Paolo - much has been made of his Italian accent, but I found it perfectly suitable, and he's totally convincing as a manipulative pretty-boy Italian gigolo.The Romance of Mrs. Stone was probably pretty sensational when it was released in 1961; and it's moral ambiguities - paying for sex and high-class prostitution, quite shocking to some. The film as aged well, although it dances around the more intimate aspects of the relationship - there's only one short love scene, which fades to black - the film certainly does a good job of highlighting the trials and tribulations of poor lonely women with bags of money who find themselves at a loss, living in exotic places and desiring to connect with someone.

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> Few words about the two movie adaptations of Tennessee's brilliant novella.The first one is the 1961 film with Vivien Leigh, Warren Beatty and Lotte Lenya, directed by Jos&eacute; Quintero and with screenplay by Gavin Lambert. The second is the 2003 made-for-television production starring Helen Mirren, Olivier Martinez and Anne Bancroft , directed by Robert Allan Ackerman and with screenplay by Martin Sherman. Neither movie does full justice to the literary original. But the former is much closer than the latter.The 1961 movie is visually rather badly dated. Most of it was shot in studio and, despite the lavish production, it's difficult to be taken in that it's Rome. But the screenplay is a fine adaptation, using most of the best lines in the novella, and Quintero is an excellent director (amazingly, this was his debut on the screen, having previously directed only on the stage). Of course any hints about Meg's lesbian inclinations or Paolo's bisexuality (one of his previous clients was a Baron) are eliminated completely, but neither are they central to the work. Few other "straight" sexual references are toned down but the character of the book is on the whole preserved.(So many people so wrongly think that Tennessee was concerned in his works with exploration of homosexuality, repressed or not. Not at all. It is confused sexuality that he finds most fascinating. And the confusion refers to both the direction and the intensity. But that's another story.)Although "A Streetcar Named Desire" remains my absolutely first choice, it is not hard to see why Tennessee Williams called this version of "The Roman Spring of Mrs Stone" "a poem" and his personal favourite of all movies based on his works.Vivien Leigh is splendid, conveying Karen's vulnerability, yet also her dignity, with marvellous restraint. Warren Beatty never was much of an actor, but in his twenties he looks totally gorgeous and that's the most important thing for the part; still, he puts on a passable Italian accent and brings off Paolo's childish ingenuity rather convincingly. Lotte Lenya is a very sneaky Contessa, apparently from German descent as her chilling "Wunderbar" in the end suggests.Unfortunately the chemistry between Warren and Vivien doesn't always work. That's the basic defect of the movie once you get past the artificiality of the studio sets and Vivien's slightly horrible wig. Otherwise this is a poignant film, cleverly directed and beautifully acted.The 2003 movie is visually spectacular. That's the best I can say about it. In every other aspect it is significantly inferior to the earlier one. The screenplay is much less successful, extending unnecessarily the part until the death of Karen's husband and omitting more from the original than the older version. There is a great deal of nudity and numerous sex scenes (the vigorous one in the car was especially glorious), but this doesn't prevent the movie from being a total disappointment. After that steamy adventure in the car comes the first of only two original additions in the screenplay worth mentioning:Karen: "Do you love me?"Paolo: "I am hungry."The universal fame of Helen Mirren is one of the great mysteries of modern times. She does a decent job here, and she looks pleasantly haggard (Vivien was accused of being too beautiful for the part), but her performance is nothing to rave about. If Warren Beatty never was much of an actor, Olivier Martinez is no actor at all; and if the chemistry between Vivien and Warren was insufficient, the one between Helen and Olivier is completely missing. Apparently the producers and the screenwriter thought that when they load the movie with nudity and sex, the chemistry would somehow materialize. Nope, doesn't work that way. Most of the scenes with Karen and Paolo are pathetic.After the visual side, the best in this movie are the supporting roles. Anne Bancroft is a scary Contessa that's not easily forgettable. Roger Allam plays Christopher, a dramatist who takes the role of Meg from the novella. The remarkable thing about this character is that he was clearly intended as a portrait of Tennessee Williams. The moustache, the voice, the laugh, the body language: everything is carefully imitated. It's a very clever touch, brilliantly executed. To him belongs the second memorable original line in the screenplay:"Beautiful boys are medicinal. Like penicillin, they should be taken twice a day until the course is finished, after which you should in theory recover."Karen Stone never fully recovered, though. </p>

 <p> Recommend this seemy tale, one of Vivien Leigh's final films and one of Warren Beatty's first.  She is haunting as an aging, widowed actress trying to regain a foothold on her life in Rome, and he is fine as a gigolo, with whom she becomes infatuated.  It also includes a wonderful performance by Lotte Lenya as his pimp, a dissolute old Countess.  This evocative story is not the most cheerful, but is certainly involving up to its somewhat mysterious ending.  I would add that it is very erotic without once getting even slightly explicit.  That says something. </p>

 <p> Rome after WWII was a bleak city with widespread destructions and rampant poverty.This story is about the loneliness and escapades of a newly widowed past-prime stage actressin Rome surrounded by a pack of unsavory characters including faded nobility, hangers-on,young upcoming 'stars' and gigolos.The film was based on Tennessee William's only novel and directed by Broadway stage directorJose Quintero (it shows by the film's stagy camera settings and sluggish camera movements).52 years after its first release, the film now looked a bit dated but Vivien Leigh remained a greatactress in her final film with fine support by the young and great-looking Warren Beatty.A worthwhile final film for Leigh's relatively short yet illustrious acting career. </p>

 <p> As a Gone With The Wind fan, I watched this movie primarily because Vivien Leigh was in it and I wanted to see how she was in her later years.  She does an excellent job of her role, she is of course an Oscar Winning Actress.  But her smoker's voice is a stark contrast to her light-hearted Scarlett O'Hara voice.  The film is based on a Tennessee Williams novel.  Which for those of us who hold the dissenting opinion of his works, that means the story is weird and obsessed with passion.  The movie features a young Warren Beatty, who does a convincing job of portraying a young Italian gigolo.  The main flaw of the film is his sudden outbursts without provocation.  It makes one wonder why Mrs. Stone (Viven Leigh) bothers to stay with such a moody and troublesome man.  The ending is almost European in style, in other words not a happy ending and not entirely clear.  I will say that the film does draw the viewer in and I found myself paying attention even though it is very slow moving.  It isn't the best film out there by any means, but it isn't the worst either. </p>

 <p> Vivien Leigh Carries A Lackluster Story </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> Taking on the role of Karen Stone was an act of considerable courage by Vivien Leigh; there were too many unfortunate parallels where life imitated art.  Mrs. Stone loses her husband of twenty years to a fatal heart attack, Ms. Leigh was divorced from her husband of twenty years Sir Laurence Olivier shortly before she began filming, which was his choice not hers.  Both were starting new lives alone, were approximately the same age in the late forties, and were worried about aging and losing their beauty, and as both were actresses, the scarcity of roles that were age appropriate.  That is where the resemblance ends however; Mrs. Stone inevitably gives in to despair, but not so Vivien Leigh who would gallantly challenge and valiantly fight the cruel fates of manic depression, aging and tuberculosis that would ultimately cause her untimely death at age fifty-three.Based on a Tennessee Williams novella, "The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone" is the story of a renowned middle-aged American actress Karen Stone (Leigh), who flees to Rome with her wealthy invalid husband (John Phillips) after a disastrous try as Shakespeare's young heroine Rosalind in "As You Like It".  En route, Mr. Stone succumbs to heart failure.  Bereft of both her husband and her career, Mrs. Stone decides to take an apartment and remain in Rome indefinitely.  At loose ends, she is increasingly aware she's beginning to "drift" without any direction, which alarms her.  This plus her status as a vulnerable rich widow, makes her prey for an unsavory Contessa  (Lotte Lenya) who is nothing more than a female pimp that dangles vain pretty boy Paulo DiLeo (Warren Beatty) in Mrs. Stone's path.  At first resistant, Mrs. Stone's loneliness and susceptibility lead her to be drawn into their web, despite warnings from her astute, caring best friend Meg Bishop (Coral Browne).The biggest flaw in this movie is the casting of Vivien Leigh.  Aged forty-seven when filming, Ms. Leigh is still so breathtaking beautiful and magnetic that there is no way she would ever need the services of a gigolo.  Except for Audrey Hepburn no actress moved with such poise and grace in every movement, she is the embodiment of Lord Bryon's poem "She Walks in Beauty Like the Night."  Exquisitely gowned by her favorite Parisian courtier, the celebrated Pierre Balmain, immaculately coifed and made up, impeccably well bred and intelligent, she is any man's dream mature woman, you'd never do better!  With the added inducements of wealth and celebrity, men of all ages would be beating a path to her door!Now, just to contradict myself, the film's biggest asset is Vivien Leigh!  She is such a consummate actress that she makes you believe that despite all the above advantages, Mrs. Stone is possessed by the twin demons of loneliness and insecurity. These linked to the double shock of losing both her husband and career almost simultaneously cause her to act irrationally and recklessly.  In repose her face is eloquent in expressing emotion, the eyes haunted with a private grief.  She makes the viewer empathize and care for her, and this is what makes the film ultimately succeed.This was Warren Beatty's second film and not much of a stretch for him playing a spoiled, petulant, indolent young man who will always love his own reflection in the mirror more than any woman.  However, as written Paulo has about the depth of a birdbath, so there's not much he can do with the role.  With her wide jack o' lantern grin, and flaming hennaed hair, Lotte Lenya is chillingly corrupt and decadent as the barracuda of a Contessa who makes her living off a stable of young boys parceled out to a moneyed clientele of both sexes.  She deservedly received an Academy Award Nomination for Best Supporting Actress.  Coral Browne as Meg Bishop, Karen's true best friend is wonderful, cultivated, elegant and statuesque, full of forthright common sense trying to save Karen from her darker instincts.  Another parallel, Ms. Leigh and Ms. Browne were very close friends in real life, Ms. Browne allegedly one of the friends that visited Ms. Leigh the day she died.  The cast is rounded out by two smaller but key roles, Jill St. John as the bubble headed, nubile American starlet Barbara Bingham and Jeremy Spenser as a dark, sinister homeless young man who is stalking the hapless Mrs. Stone.  Also look for in cameos both quite young, Cleo Laine as a singer in a nightclub, and Jean Marsh of "Upstairs, Downstairs" fame as one of Paolo's conquests.Acclaimed New York theatre director Jose Quintero directed this his one and only film; as an initial effort, he does quite well.  The screenplay is expertly adapted by Gavin Lambert and provides several memorable scenes for the Misses Leigh, Lenya and Browne.  Kudos to production designer Roger Furse, the movie was filmed in London but you'd never know it by his sets, he evokes a Rome that is not the sunlit, joyous "Eternal City" of say "Roman Holiday", but one that is ominous and disquieting with a sense of inner decay.  Mrs. Stone's sumptuously appointed rooftop apartment perched in lofty splendor above the cascade of the Spanish Steps reflects the lady's breeding and good taste, but ultimately is not a safe haven for her.The extras in the DVD are the original theatrical trailer and a short featurette entitled "Mrs. Stone: Looking for Love in All the Dark Corners" that is moderately interesting and features Jill St. John and Tennessee Williams biographer Donald Spoto.Supposedly this  was Tennessee Williams favorite film adaption of his works; he considered it almost a poem, and Vivien Leigh as Mrs. Stone one of his truest film heroines.  Since his other memorable film heroines included Blanche Du Bois, Maggie the Cat, Catharine Holly and Alexandra del Lago, this is high praise indeed.Although Ms. Leigh illuminates Mrs. Stone with her artistry, it's regrettable that she played so many ill-fated or unhappy characters in her few film appearances.  On the stage she was a sparkling comedienne as in "The Skin of Our Teeth", "The School for Scandal", and "Look After Lulu".  Another film released the same year as "Roman Spring..." was a charming romantic comedy called "The Pleasure of His Company" where Lilli Palmer played an enchanting, witty, sophisticated mature woman who more than holds her own with former husband Fred Astaire and current husband Gary Merrill to a happy conclusion.  This would have been a welcome change of pace and Vivien Leigh's star would have shone that much brighter if she could have played this role in addition to poor Mrs. Stone. </p>

 <p> She doesn't have to pay or go begging for attention.  That inside deliciousness means she has and will always have the world at her feet which means casting her in yet another post war film depicting the Ancient Italians as predatory, parasitic and useless people hints that the story is not what it appears on the surface.  In any case, this movie along with Light in the Piazza would have warned off or encouraged American audiences that for some inexplicable reason, the American dollar goes far in Italy and with Italians and makes the Italy's deep and wealthy culture less intimidating to American travelers.She's so pretty with her pointy smile and her newly smokey voice and her pretty precise enunciation.  It's very satisfying to see Vivien Leigh in color.Lotte Lenya is naturally creepy in this film.  I would think she wouldn't have had access to Americans because there is something of a constant rage running through her. </p>

 <p> I searched everywhere for this movie, before I contacted Amazon.com and found it, because to my mind, it exactly captures Tennessee Williams' story. Vivien Leigh is fabulous as Mrs. Stone. She has exactly the right degree of world weariness and vulnerability, and of course even towards the the end of her career when this picture was made, she embodies my idea of glamour.Warren Beatty is the ideal gigolo. His Italian accent may not be perfect, but I don't believe that anyone could have done it better. He looks just right, and of course he turned out in later life to be a great womaniser, so this role is almost type casting.All in all it is a wonderful addition to my movie collection. </p>

 <p> Get it too see Vivien Leigh in her fragile second to last film roll (it was "art imitating life"). She was fascinating in everything she did.Warren Beatty's "preformance" is excruiatingly "high school play" - way out of his league with Leigh, Lotte Lenya (an over the top, scenery-chewing interpretation), and Coral Browne. Beatty's accent is "Eye-Talian" rather than Italian, his continental "flair", that of a soda-jerk (it's right up there in miscasting idiocy with John Wayne's, Genghis Kahn (THE CONQUEROR) but embarrassing instead of hilarious {Wayne}.I have a sentimental soft-spot for this film, but in reality it really isn't a success the SHOWTIME adaptation ( with the great Helen Mirren) is very close to the original short story. In 1961 the moronic censors would not allow a Williams adaptation to be filmed without major alterations (A Streetcar Named Desire - Sweet Bird of Youth - Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, were all but ruined had it not been for some very clever screenwriters).The DVD transfer is good - with the Trailer and a short infomative documentary about it's making.If you can afford both versions, by all means get both, otherwise SHOWTIME made the definitive "ROMAN SPRING". </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> This film is worth seeing because of the talents involved. Vivien Leigh continues her fictional autobiography on film, Scarlett in desperation became Blanche but found a rich husband who dies and she ends as the despondent Mrs. Stone, which somewhat mirrored Leigh's own troubled life, at least in trajectory. Leigh's mental problems and nymphomania bleed through brief moments in the performance and make it uncomfortable if real. Warren Beatty is physically blessed for the role of gigilo supreme (his own personal qualities bleed through as well) but his inability to play an Italian is so obvious  the part should have been rewritten into Paul the American ex-pat. Lotte Lenya in her first screen role since Pabst's "Threepenny" in the early 30s is perfection as the Countess pimp. Her relationship with her pet is the most powerful in the film. She's worth having it for alone. Williams script is flawed by the pervasive Death Wish theme, there is no where to go with the story, it becomes a very intimate flat scandalous tabloid story (very much kin to "The Misfits"). Quintero, one of the great theater talents (personally responsible for the revival of Eugene O'Neill from oblivion), does not know how to shape a film and in particular the end, which should have power, hardly registers. When such great talents work together, it is worth seeing even if only to see where even they went wrong. If the others had worked with the focus and force of Lenya, this film would have been something much greater than it is. </p>

Tennessee Williams is my favorite author so I love everything that he does and this was no exception.  There is another version with Helen Mirren that is good too but Vivien will always have that aura about her that we all so loved.

 <p> In most movies of this period dealing with prostitution, it is always a man buying a girl. However, strangely for 1961, the roles are reversed. Vivien Leigh is the lonely middle-aged rich widow spending money on gigolo Warren Beatty, not knowing until the end that he never really loved her. Famous line, "I'm drifting." Ironically, Vivien Leigh was drifting. She was just divorced from Sir. Laurence Oliver and was facing a life without him. Warren Beatty gives a credible perfomance as the gigolo. Jill St. John looks so beautiful, and according to the interview on this dvd, Vivien Leigh was jealous of her. Vivien never did talk to Jill St. John during filming of the movie. She only nodded. The was Tennessee William's only novel and according to interview, he based the Vivien Leigh character off himself, Williams was a homosexual. I gave the movie a 3 rating because it is slow . Also, compared to William's other plays, this doesn't have much of a plot. However, the acting is fabulous. The setting is in beautiful Rome, Italy with many beautiful scenes. The colors are vibrant and beautiful. This was Ms. Leigh's last major role. She died 6 years later. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone is a magnificent failure of a film: it addresses the themes of fear, self-loathing and the decay of age more sensitively than any other Hollywood film which springs to mind, but ultimately feels a bit cramped and over-done at times. Based on a Tennesee Williams novel, it tells the story of Karen Stone, an aging actress known for her light, comedic performances, who, after a failed turn in Shakespeare's As You Like It begins to fret that her career is over. She makes the decision to set off for Rome with her husband, who dies on the plane taking them there. She meets up with a handsome young money-hungry gigolo, played by an out-of-his-league Warren Beattie, whose terrible faux-Italian accent threatens to turn this film into camp. It contains one of Vivien Leigh's darkest and most autobiographical turns as the miserable Mrs. Stone, who shacks up with Beattie to try to bring some meaning to her life. She is as beautiful and sensitive here as she ever was. Two excellent performances by Lotte Lenya and Coral Browne help to bolster the film's quality. Lotte Lenya's lends a superb performance as the witch-like Contessa whose stable of handsome boys entertain the bored, wealthy American expatriates, both male and female. The always-engaging Coral Browne is brilliant as Karen's close friend, Meg, who attempts to help her and pull her out of the downward spiral of decay in which she is so clearly headed. A bonus featurette on the DVD discusses the troubled making of the film, it is particularly poignant in its discussions of the insecurities that Williams, Leigh and Beattie faced at the time of the film's creation. </p>

 <p> This is a very slow paced story with really nowhere to go. The acting was quite atrocious, including Vivien Leigh's. Her performance was simply laughable and unconvincing, especially her reactions to Warren Beatty when he was being an ass to her. Beatty was definitely miscast, since his Italian accent was very bad, and he wasn't good looking enough to play an irresistible gigolo. Come on, why would rich American women lust after a scrawny, beady-eyed, fat lipped Beatty? The ending will just piss the hell out you after having spend so much time suffering through this mess. </p>

 <p> A very real side of Roman life is shown in this film ~ love for sale. In the train station or on the beaches of Ostia, the ragazzi barter with male or female for cash. Young men parade themselves in hopes of bedding old, wealthy, foreign woman. Vivien Leigh is haunting in Williams' treatise on withering beauty, aging and diminishing chances for love. While Beatty's looks fit the part of a gigolo, he is unbelievable as an Italian, an unfortunate miscast. Leigh's abandonment brings the film to a chilling conclusion. </p>

 <p> Today was my very first time watching this. didn't have a desire or anything to see it but today, I happened to catch it on TCM(bless you TCM)and I was intrigued. For one, I believe if they did this same movie today(and I see a later version with Helen Mirren),I feel that the ending would be different.For one, you have this lady(Vivien Leigh)whose comeback was a flop and closes the show and leaves town with her husband who lovingly indulges her. Sadly, on the trip to Rome, he dies enroute. Sad,lonely,bereft, she goes about town dealing with her sorrow. But, there are those who come along and surely funk things up if you get my drift. Along comes this woman, a countessa(Lotte Lenya)who in actuality is a unadulterated "pimp" straight up. My guess is she is impoverished and she provides companionship to lonely American expatriates with an upfront fee of 50% to keep her in the lifestyle she is accustomed to, and she goes around town with her charges hoping to palm them off to lonely and well paid Americans and others who can afford to pay for the company of such people. Of course, Stone(Leigh)rejects it, but with time and some persuasion from Beatty(Paolo, with some coaching from Lenya),she does. What bothers me with this is not so much that she took a lover, but that she is ridiculed by the very people she helps and provides for, as well as others. I will admit that up until the latter part of the last century, older women were ridiculed for having younger men in their lives. Today, Mrs Stone could be like Meryl Streep, do a string of great film roles, glorify and mellow in her maturity and on the fact that she still got the juice. In this film, although the need to be with someone is most definitely a need, and  a requirement in order to live and thrive,it is pushed aside in her case and I find it sad. Stone(Leigh)in the film stated on the fact of being desired or not at all. I found her statement quite telling and revealing. Her other statement on having three or four years to enjoy life then move on was quite as omnious. Interesting tale but I wouldn't call it her roman spring, but winter tale.. just my take.As far as the roles, Leigh, Beatty and Lenya were great. sadly, this was one of the last films of Vivien Leigh, who seems to possess a fragile spirit borne in life to her roles with the exception of Gone With The Wind. </p>
