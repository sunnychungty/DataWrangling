 <p> Frank wrote about Positive Thinking in a manner that encompassed all aspects of life.  There is the stressful work like, financial burdens, weight/health issues, he covered it all.  Yes, a lot of it was common sense, but it focused on how to directly apply it to your life with Mantras.  Those are important, that self talk to bring you out of negativity.  Yes, Highly recommend this book and keep on your shelf for continued reading and encouragement.  I know I am going too. </p>

 <p> Positive Thinking ~ Discover the Magic of Positive Thinking by Author Frank MullaniWhat a wonderful motivational book! It is definitely one that I can relate too as I am an inspirational/self-help author myself and I found the tips in this book on positive thinking most helpful.Author Frank Mullani goes to great lengths to stress the power of the subconscious mind and the importance of retraining it to have positive thoughts and end goals. He believes it is necessary to learn new habits in order to bring a more positive approach into the conscious mind. We have all been negatively affected to varying degrees by our past and are constantly influenced by this negative frame of reference. In order to bring about the desired change, it is a good habit to get past our possible negative self-image. In doing so, we must dig deeper than the surface/conscious level to bring about true and lasting positive changes in our lives.This gifted author provides numerous suggestions and tips on how best to conquer and overcome these past negative influences in order to have a full and rewarding life based on positive thoughts and experiences. He touts the benefits of meditation, visualization, and setting positive goals. I like his idea of initially taking small steps in order to achieve our goals and then going from there to achieve even bigger ones. He states that good ideas come to mind long before the dream is realized. There are many thought provoking ideas in this easy-to-read handbook. Good stuff!Inspirational Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores AyotteGrowing Up & Liking It </p>

 <p> Positive Thinking is the best way to start your day right. Sometimes I keep on thinking negatively I mean not 100% but more than half of it, but after reading this book my mindset will surely think always in a positive way. One of the things that I really liked about this book was that the author had a good balance between emotions and our faith. Great content and I will most likely read this book again so I can keep the tips to fresh in my mind. </p>

 <p> Positive Thinking is how I start my day. It's hard not to think negative thoughts but with the help of this great book I am focussing more on positive thinking all day long.There is a nice synergy between positivism and faith, and although I am not religious I found this to be helpful. I am finding that it is having an effect on my life so will keep it up and refer back to the book often.Nice share - thanks! </p>
