 <p> I was sent an advance copy of "Bionicle 2" from Amazon before it was released to the public; now I have to admit that movies based on toys and video games like this and the Anime genre are not really my cup of tea, but I watched this with an open mind.Having never seen the first Bionicle movie (again, these aren't my forte), the storyline of "Bionicle 2" pretty much went over my head, but the animation and effects are excellent. It's really astounding what animators can do with today's computer technology.This movie is very low on scary images and there is no violence, so it's safe for kids to watch by themselves. </p>

 <p> My review for this film is basically the same as my first (so read that one for a review of this one) except for one thing, the story is much better, it's darker, it's funner, and some non-bionicle fans might find it kinda sorta interesting.6/10 stars </p>

 <p> This film remains me of that classic Groucho Marx joke in which he points out that a document is so simple even a four year old could understand it.  Then, he quickly follows that up with "Quick, find me a four year old.  I can't make heads or tails out of this."And so, it's the same way with Bionicle 2.  Adults will have no clue with on earth is going on in this weird direct-to-DVD CGI animated film.  Kids, on the other hand, especially if they are big fans of LEGOs or transformers or such, will enjoy it immensely and will have an intuitive understanding of the plot.  It apparently involves a pre-historical mythology about the land of these little living machine things.  They are protected by bigger machine heroes (first one, then six) who must save them from an even bigger evil, chuckling machine-thing with bat wings.  The plot borrows heavily from Star Wars (especially Attack of the Clones) and Ecco the Dolphin (that cool water-tunnel effect) and a handful of countless Japanese anime.  There's nothing really original here, and the movie even takes a shortcut by NOT showing us much of the six quests performed by our heroes (presumably, these stories can be found in some comic books, sold separately, naturally).However, the CGI animation is quite good, and the movie sounds really great.  If you have a strong home theater system, this film will rock!  Just be sure to have your kid handy to explain the story to you.  This film is based on the LEGOs toys and is in English, but it might as well be in Japanese unless you have a kid around to "translate" for you.video: 5/5 awesome, crystal clearaudio: 5/5 excellent sound qualitystory: 3/5, no replay value for adults, plenty for kidsextras: 2/5 mostly promo junk, nothing truly worthwhileBottom line: Kids will love it, and parents might as well get it for them as a holiday present. </p>

 <p> I watched the first movie on a whim, and was impressed with it, although its plot was somewhat thin and prdictable in places, but this movie overcame those drawbacks.  It is a very dark story, with plenty of humor to take the edge off.  Many other shows and movies have tried to tell a similar story, but none of them have told it as well, while leaving at least two threads to be picked up in a third movie.I had no interest in collecting or following the Bionicle Toys before I saw the movie, and I still dont, but dont tell the Lego marketing department the movie isnt selling me toys, because I really want to see a thrid movie. </p>

 <p> Bioncle 2 is a classic adventure movie for kids. It has elements of the storylines such as Lord of the Rings and Star Wars.The story in Bioncle 2 is an old story: Good vs evil and finding the power within yourself to win. I, however, feel that the story is told well. The writers create a neat universe and use an easy to understand but someowhat advanced vocabulary. I was pleased to see words like archivist brought into a movie that appears to be guaged around 7-12. There is even a little bit of slapstick humor.Of additional note, the movie does address "The Great Spirt" quite often and I think those who are interested in having movies of a religious nature might find it interesting to watch this movie with their children and discuss the themes: good vs evil, finding yourself, faith and altruism.The graphics, music and sound effects are well used. There is cartoon violence but not much different from what would be found in Harry Potter and/or Power Rangers. I do think very young children might find the last 15 minutes a bit scary. I would advise if there were scared by Jurassic Park to be careful with having them view this movie, especially alone.The family could sit down and watch this movie together. While it is predictable for adults, I think it is short enough for ages about 7-12 (or mature 6 year old) to enjoy it like they would afternoon cartoons. </p>

 <p> OK, Bionicle fans, skip this review, since this is for people who wonder whether this is really as good as these Bionicle fans say.Well, my sad answer is: It's NOT. It IS, however, FAR better than the previous (hideous) film--although there was really nowhere to go but up.Pros: There are actually a couple of characters I LIKED in this movie, and some scenes DO actually WORK (a major improvement over the last movie).Cons: The REST of the characters and scenes either make no sense or are just annoying. And "The Great Spirit" is so fake-o-politically-correctly-pseudo-religious that it isn't even funny.  It's just CHEESY!A lot of things didn't make any sense whatsoever. Like, the "Sea of Protodermis". What was that!? Nobody bothers to explain that it ISN'T just water that they're sailing and swimming through.  I was only able to discover that Protodermis is their building material and was being researched and refined, because I looked on and in the box and was FINALLY able to infer what it was.  But you should be able to understand a movie ON IT'S OWN!!!  WITHOUT having to read and study and research.Not even the fight scenes worked.  Why on earth would you have to turn visible to fire a disk launcher?  And when did Vakama combine the other disks? On his coffee break!? And what were they carrying their extra items in ANYway? And the Toa powers were SO unbalanced. ONE Toa (the most annoying one, to boot) gets not only two mask powers, but he gets THE BEST ONES!  FLYING AND SHAPESHIFTING!? How is that fair? All Vakama gets is invisibility! Even the names are a bit shaky.  I mean, come on--Onewa vs. Onua?! And the names "VAkama" and "NOkama" are too similar!The only scenes that DID work were:The one where Vakama and Nokama were talking in the back of that storage-vehicle-thing, and--The other ones with Nokama actually sort of worked, too. Mostly.These scenes were an improvement, but not enough to save the REST of the movie.And everyone keeps saying how great the animation is!  That bugs me.  A LOT.  The animation is--well, I won't go so far as to say "hideous', since the kikanalo were actually sort of animated well, and the backgrounds were pretty cool.  But the moving, living characters?  The sheer horror...... I don't know, maybe they were TRYING to make them move like the toys.  Since THAT'S what they were like.  EVEN STANDING STILL, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!!  If their aim was to make them like people, then they failed miserably.  They're akward and toy-like and just not fun to look at. I could go on for hours with all the problems they had.In short, if you love Bionicle and know everything about it, this movie's for you.  You might even understand some of it.For the average viewer, you might want to skip it. Although it IS better than the first one. </p>

 <p> I was rather impressed with the first Bionicle movie "Mask of light," the animation was awesome and the plot was well-done in my opinion. That said, Bionicle II: Legends of Metru Nui was far from a disappointment. The beginning will be a bit confusing at first if you're thinking its the sequel to "Mask of Light." Legends of Metru Nui is more a prequel than a sequel; it explains some of the things that were left unexplained (if any) in the first movie and the plot is just as good as the first one only with a little more depth to it.Basically, there's something amiss going on in Metru Nui that has to do the Metorian the smaller versions of the bionicle, and new creatures called Vahki fighters who aren't evil nor good. Six Metorian are chosen to become mighty Toa in order to figure out the strange happenings goin on in Metru Nui and the disappearance of a great Toa-fighter.The action and animations in the movie are well done although the running animations are strange: they appear to hop when they run. Some of the scenes were downright hilarious to watch and the music was just as good, there wasn't a childish hint to it at all. Many people compare Bionicle with anime and if anything Bionicle is far from being an anime-styled movie, it certainly doesn't have to be from Japan to be a good movie last time I remember (take for example; The lord of the rings and dare I say it, Star Wars).The extras are worth looking twice at, there are trailers and sneak peaks for future Bionicle projects and the making of the second movie. Lastly, the voice acting was great: voices for the characters were humorous and melodramatic in all the right places, there wasn't a moment of lack of talent anywhere. You can easily watch this movie without spoiling the first one since it is a prequel, though I recommend you watch the first one for a better grasp on what they talk about in this movie. 5 stars! </p>

 <p> I had my secretary's son (he's 10), watch this film and then he sent me a written review via e-mail.  He gave it an A+.  The graphics are "awesome" and it made him feel as though he was playing a game with "advanced graphics on my PS2 (Playstation 2)."  It's a film that you will want to watch over and over again...plenty of action "right around the corner."  "As soon as something happens, something really unexpected happens next."  It's a movie that will keep you guessing and thinking.  Buy it!  You, and the youngsters in the family, will be thoroughly entertained. </p>

 <p> These come in a series; however, they can be watched and enjoyed in any order.  The only problem is buying the action figures other than online since this is an older series of dvds.  However, the figures can be found with some searching online. </p>

 <p> Needless to say that this movies is made for a very young audience -- for approx. the 6-year olds or so. There's lots of fantasy in it and it's obvious that the creative team has put a lot of effort and hard work into the making of this 75-minute flick -- that's why we find it tough as we're sure they've done their very best.But before someone spends their hard-earned dollar on this, it's worth it to look at it objectively. For our part we think that the background graphics/animation is not of the best quality and even vague at times, although there are scenes that are nicely done; then the script doesn't stand out at all as much of the storyline is cliche regarding this type of genre.At times some of the characters remind us of a cheap imitation of the first star wars movie, and it seems as if the execution of the whole concept is just missing something. We're just glad that the violence is toned down and that this flick has a PG rating. We're certain that the creators had apparently the best of intentions, but when it comes right down to it I wouldn't waste my money or time on this film and I wouldn't let my kids watch this movie -- there are better films out there.Some kids may be motivated to get involved in weird video games after watching this movie and it may also lead them to watch other films in this genre which may not be healthy for their little minds. </p>

 <p> After watching Bionicle - Mask of Light, I heard news of a second Bionicle movie coming out in 2004. This movie would be called Bionicle 2 - Legends of Metru Nui--and it would star the Toa Metru and show its viewers the world of Bionicle from a whole new perspective.I won't give any spoilers, but I can inform you that the movie is far superior to the first movie in every way.Storywise, the movie is very complex and satisfying. We start the movie off when we're introduced to Toa Lhikan: the last toa in his group. The movie shows how he is on a mission to deliver six stones to six matoran: Nokama, Onewa, Whenua, Matau, Nuju, and Vakama. Each of these matoran receive the stones and turn into toa themselves.It's at this point in the movie where the storyline begins to turn very chaotic and heart-wrenching. Almost immediately after being turned into a toa, Vakama begins to have nightmarish visions that he cannot quite understand. These visions rupture his mind when he is in danger of dying, wondering about Metru Nui's safety, and even when he experiences the whole climax of the movie.Just like in the first movie, Makuta serves as the main antagonist. However, he has an even more sinister plan for Metru Nui than what he had for Mata Nui in the first movie. We even get a much better feel for Makuta's personality than what we had seen from Mask of Light.For those of you who may not have realized it, Bionicle 2 - Legends of Metru Nui is a prequel to Bionicle - Mask of Light. It shows exactly HOW the first movie began and WHERE the matoran of Mata Nui came from.To finish this review, Bionicle 2 - Legends of Metru Nui is a fantastic movie; it takes everything that was great in the first movie and increases its greatness to the absolute limit. Even better visuals, better personality capturings, and a better storyline cause this to be a better piece than the original Bionicle movie. </p>
