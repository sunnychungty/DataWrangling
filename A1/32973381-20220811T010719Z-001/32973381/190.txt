 <p> Bruno Ganz is a great actor but he was miscast in this role.  It is way too obvious that he does not speak in this movie, perhaps because he does not speak Greek.  This considerably diminished his acting to the point of being unconvincing.  The least they could have done is a better dubbing job.  The character he attempts to play is completely self-absorbed, with very little regard for anyone else who is still living and even reality in general.  He should have been a happy man who had a good life before becoming ill, especially when his life is compared to that of the trafficked children.  But he was very miserable.  He seems to have failed in all his relationships with everyone, except for the Albanian boy.  The relationship with the boy was not well-developed, however, and it is not clear why Alexandre rescued him.  It could be his last desperate attempt to somehow redeem himself, but even that is not consistent with the way he is otherwise.  His character is not the least bit appealing.  His ponderings seem vain and futile.  I felt nothing for him.  I could not even sympathize with his suffering due to illness - he was so unconvincing that it looked like he was pretending.  The boy did a good acting job, and the images of Greece from Alexandre's past were beautiful.  Still, I could not wait for this film to end.  I kept wondering what this film was really about.  After seeing the striking landscape of hanging human bodies at the Albanian border, I figured that it is an art film for specialized clientele which is supposed to be inscrutable to general audience.  To me it seemed to be too long, boring, contrived and pretentious to even give it one star. </p>

 <p> Of all of the 4 films American audiences are allowed to see by Theo Angelopoulos, this is one my favorite. Angelopoulos' films offer the same elements in everyone. He's a bold director when compared to American directors, then again, all foreign directors are bold compared to American ones, even our best like Martin Scorsese, Coppola, or Woody Allen. Angelopoulos' films have long takes. With long single camera shots. And to some, his films are flooded with portentous dialogue. And, I must admit I am usually in awe at the beginning moments of any Angelopoulos film. But, after a while, after I've taken in the subtle charm of the cinematography, the beautiful visuals, and his way of story telling, I can't help but sometimes grow impatient. And, while yes, that happened to me while watching this movie, it's a film that now, after a year or moreso, I think back of fondly. I remember the beautiful scenes by the sea. How beautifully Angelopoulos set up these scenes. He really is a master of imagery."Eternity and a Day" tells a rather simple but yet deep and poetic story of a man's dying days, and one day he spends with a small lost boy (Achileas Skevis). The man is Alexandre (Bruno Ganz). Alexandre does not want to die. As the song goes, he has a lot of livin' to do. He now reflects upon his past. Memories of his wife, his mother. He even visit's his daughter whom he has not seen in some time. He wants to rectify all the wrong that has happened in the past. And he gets a chance to when he meets this boy. Here I suppose Angelopoulos is playing with the elements of time. Past, present and future. The more time Alexandre spends with the boy, trying to get him back home, the more he is reminded of his past. Not to mention the fact that he is dying."Eternity and a Day" is a film that I'm sure not all will be pleased with. It's too subtle of a film. It takes it's time telling a story. It's moves slow, but it means to. I'm not saying these are faults, but, I know today's society has no time to watch these types of movies. American audiences like fast movies. Filmmakers like Angelopoulos may never find their audiences. But, despite everything, one could not hide the beauty the film has. The script written by Angelopoulos, Tonino Guerra, Petro Markaris, & Giorgio Silvagni has moments that are as tender as I've ever seen in any movie. The cinematograhy by Yorgos Arvanitis & Andreas Sinanos is wonderful as well."Eternity and a Day" won the Cannes Film Festival's Golden Palm, an award Angelopoulos is no stranger to. His "Suspended Step of the Stork" was nominated before as was "The Hunters". And "Ulysses' Gaze", if I remember right, won second place at the Cannes behind "Underground". "Day" is a movie all foreign film fans should see. You'll be impressed by the simple things the film has to offer. Also, will someone please release "The Suspended Step of the Stork" on video already! And the rest of Angelopoulos' films!Bottom-line:"Eternity and a Day" is admittedly a slow moving film and does take some patience to watch, but the film has startling imagery. It's subtle charms carry you under it's spell. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> The 1998 film by Greek director Theo Angelopoulos, Eternity And A Day (Mia Aioniotita Kai Mia Mera or ''' '''''''''' ''' ''' ''''), is not merely another film about a supposed poet wherein the art of poetry and the act of poesizing are never on display. Yes, it's true that, technically, neither are onscreen, but it is a superior film about a supposed poet wherein the art of poetry and the act of poesizing are never on display, for the film does capture the dead clich&eacute; of `a soul of a poet' as well as just about any I've ever seen. It does it with imagery, and Angelopoulos's patented long takes, but it does capture it, and exceedingly well. The film was not only directed by Angelopoulos, but he wrote the screenplay. That it won that year's Cannes Film Festival's coveted Palm D'Or shows that, sometimes, quality still counts.The tale subtly weaves the past, present, and future tenses of a dying man, the bearded poet Alexander (Bruno Ganz, best known for starring in Wim Wenders' Wings Of Desire, and the later Adolf Hitler biopic Downfall, as Hitler), as he muses on life a day before he is to enter a hospital for an unspecified `test.' In this manner, the film is in the fine tradition of films on dying men trying top come to grips with their lives, such as Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru, and Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries. Yet, where the former film achieves its aims by balancing out the life of the dying man with that of a young woman, then turns the film on its head by dealing with the legacy of the man after his death, and the latter film evokes dread by displaying the subconscious memories of its lead character, Eternity And A Day splits the difference, as Alexander, after leaving his seaside apartment in Thessaloniki, after learning he has a terminal illness and must enter a hospital the next day, muses on a neighbor across the way who mirrors his taste in music, befriends a young unnamed immigrant Albanian boy (Achilleas Skevis) who is being exploited and slips in and out of his and others' pasts by simply walking into them. Angelopoulos does not cut to the past. His characters' pasts are extensions of their presents.... Of course, the length of most of the takes, with the shortest being longer than most Hollywood shots, means most speed-addicted American viewers will be bored by the film. Yet, can there be a better recommendation for such a work? And, despite the long takes, the 126 minute long film feels far shorter, and this is because each scene leaves an immense intellectual and emotional impact. It was written by Angelopoulos, longtime Fellini screenwriter Tonino Guerra ,and Petros Markaris. The scoring by Eleni Karaindrou is pitch perfect, as it never overwhelms nor guides the viewer beyond what the scenes' immanent power holds.The acting by Ganz is wonderful, and a textbook display of full body acting. In the modern scenes he moves slowly and with a slump in his bearing, while when he enters the past, he has alacrity and grace. It is stated, in online descriptions of the film, that Ganz's lines were dubbed into Greek, but this presents little problem as there is not much dialogue, Alexander's facial hair partially covers his lips, and many of the speaking scenes are from a distance or the back. Again, the conveyance of his emotional and psychological states is predominantly by bodily acting. The same is not true for the boy, and Achilleas Skevis gives yet another terrific acting performance for a European child actor. His face has hints of the American Culkin acting clan, yet he is far more subtle and expressive, and when he jokes to Alexander that `buying words' on the docks may be expensive, there is an impishness to his glinting eyes that few American brat actors could capture....Eternity And A Day is another great film by a master of the art who has been sorely neglected in the United States. It asks of its two lead characters, Why am I always a stranger in exile?, and gives no clear answer, save to estrange the two of them from each other and themselves....Alexander's final estrangement is not as cheery, and comes as he enters his old home- the one his daughter has sold for demolition. He looks about, exits out the back door, and into the sunny past where Anna and other friends are singing. They stop, ask him to join them, then they all dance, and soon, there is only the poet and his wife in motion. Then, she slowly pulls away, and he claims his hearing is gone. He also cannot see her, it seems. He calls out and asks how long tomorrow will be, after he has told her he refuses to go into the hospital, as planned. She tells him tomorrow will last eternity and a day. The film ends with Alexander, back to us, mumbling in untranslated Greek (do we really need to know what he is saying at this point, anyway?) watching the waves on the ocean do what they do, for a long time. It is in moments like this that Angelopoulos reveals that, while he is the equal of the best filmmakers in the art's history, such as Fellini or Bergman, he has more seriousness than the former, and a more profound empathy than the latter. Where that ultimately places him on the scale of the cinematic pantheon is to be argued over, but not the fact that he belongs. He and this film are that great. </p>

 <p> This film doesn't need me as an advocate. It won the 1998 Palme d'Or and deservedly so. It is a beautiful, meditative, thought-provoking film. Like the Amazon editorial indicated, it is akin to Bergman's "Wild Strawberries," and Kurosawa's "Ikiru." Like them, at its centre is an old man, at the end of his life, looking back, trying to find some meaning to it all. Here is a man, who for all his life has been absorbed by two things, himself and his work. He coasts through life not really relating to those nearest and dearest to him. Now at the end of his life, he opens a letter from his long-dead wife; a letter which speaks of her love for him and recounts what for her was a very special day, but which for him, was just another day which slipped away without much thought. As he reads the letter, he relives that "perfect" day; one that meant so much to his wife but to which he himself was an almost absent participant. He tries to make amends for his life-long distancing and aloofness by trying to help a little Albanian runaway. But in the end, it is too little too late.In the word-game he plays with the Albanian child, the boy brings him three words which actually make up the central themes of the film. The first word, "Korfulamu," refers to the tender love between mother and child; the second, "Xenitis," refers to being in exile, being a stranger or an outsider; and the third word, "Argathini," means late in the night, or simply too late. He chants these words repeatedly at the end of the film. For these words encapsulate his life. And they encapsulate the themes of this haunting film. But Angelopulos makes clear it is not a pessimistic film. In the final scene before he enters the Hospital to die, he asks the memory of his wife, "How long does Tomorrow last?" and she replies, "An Eternity and a Day." In the end, you have the choice. However short your time, you can make even the slightest act, the most significant; even the briefest moment last forever.Sadly this film will not appeal to most Americans. Like the previous reviewer has put it so succinctly, most will see it as "excruciatingly slow" and "boring". I also liked the way another reviewer described how its briefest shots are "longer than the longest shots in most Hollywood movies". It is languid. It is not meant to be hurried through. It is an "art-film" and if anything, it is visual poetry. It does require some maturity and will appeal to those who have reached a stage where they can look back and ponder. Give it the chance and you will be rewarded.Alas, New Yorker Video continues its tradition of shoddy DVD transfers. The print is exceedingly dark. The picture is extremely soft, at points blurry. Nicks, scratches and dirt specks abound. The film is presented in its original 1.66:1 widescreen, letterboxed into a 4:3 frame. It has not been enhanced for widescreen TV. We are given the original Greek 2.0 Dolby Surround track. Sound is serviceable. Optional English subtitles are provided. The Extras are surprisingly very good. The highlight is a 22-minute introduction by Andrew Horton, Professor of Film Studies at the University of Oklahoma. He talks of the film in relation to Homer's Odyssey, Angelopulos' visual style, postmodernism and Angelopulos' standing in the history of Cinema. There is a 10-minute "Analysis of a shot," made for French TV, in which Angelopulos himself talks about his shooting style. This is in French with optional English subtitles. Finally there is a collection of Greek poetry from Solomos, Seferis and Cavafy, all in English translations. Solomos is the poet featured in the fantasy sequences and whose poem, the film's protagonist spent his whole life trying to complete. There is also an 8-page foldout featuring an informative interview with Angelopulos. However, the film itself deserves a much better transfer. Hopefully Criterion can release it someday, suitably restored, so it can stand alongside their lovely restorations of the Bergman and Kurosawa classics to which it has been compared. </p>

 <p> Hey, how come I'm the only one to review this film so far?  The subtitles failed at the end.  It didn't matter because I think the director had no idea how to end the film.  It was a big muddle with lots of wonderful scenery.  The pace was often excruciatingly slow with slow long pans to nothing special.  It was kind of like film students made this film.  The poet with the stovepipe hat who came back from Italy to fight the ottoman empire was too too boring.  But Greece was just lovely.  Is there really a fence around Albania?  Why were those people hanging on the fence?  Was the point of the story that the guy spent too much time on the job?  The daughter sure turned out to be a stinker. </p>

 <p> The basic plot of ETERNITY AND A DAY is straightforward enough - an aging writer Alexandre (Bruno Ganz) meets a young illegal Albainian immigrant (Achileas Skevis) and takes his home.  As he does so, the writer reflects on his own life; his past; his relationship with his mother and his wife; and what he has achieved in his life.  Yet Theodoros Angeloploulos' film is at heart a meditation on the act of writing: when we set down words on the page, do they actually record our experiences, or can they only provide an approximation of what we are feeling at any particular moment?  Alexandre is perpetually tormented by this thought - although successful in his chosen career, he believes that he has been a failure, simply because of the notion that words can only allude to experience, not record it.  The child, in his innocence, believes that words can be found, or bought; but however much one pays for that word (in terms of buying a book, for instance, or when a writer receives royalties for what they have done), those words are still inadequate.  They are both allusive - in the sense that their relationships to actions and things are contingent upon circumstances - and elusive (in the sense that such relationships are only approximate).  With such uncertainties in his mind, Alexandre comes to understand that there is no &#34;final&#34; distinction between &#34;life&#34; and &#34;death&#34; (after all, they are only words); he has to experience both as a continuum, without the support of anyone.  Visually speaking, the film is full of stylistic ironies: Angelopoloulos' camera is perpetually tracking forwards; we see cars in the traffic-choked streets driving off to somewhere, or traveling on the freeway; while the characters are seen crossing the frame from left to right.  All suggest some kind of forward movement, a desire to go from one place to another.  However such movements are not &#34;progressive&#34; at all, but rather suggest a desire not reflect on life's futility (as Alexandre discovers through his words).  In a sense such movements are an evasion rather than an engagement with existence.  The same also goes for the &#34;narrative&#34; of the film: Angelopoloulos shows that it is not particularly significant: what matters more is for viewers to reflect on the mise-en-scene within individual frames; to listen to the words, focus on the actors' expressions and body movements, and understand Alexandre's state of mind.  A long and complex film, ETERNITY AND A DAY befits repeated viewings. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> All of us, who are deeply familiarized about the existential issues of Theo Angelopoulos, know about his films demand from the viewer an absolute concentration, every frame is by itself a symbol, of mythic or poetic nature. The point to remark is the profound attachment of this emblematic Greek artist of the camera for his native land as well as the use of the midst as visual metaphor that allows him to make a fabulous set-up  process that ties images in flash-backs or flawless narrative ellipsis surrounded of a pristine nostalgia and perpetual homesickness by the recent past.The film deals with the golden days of a recognized but now old writer, extremely sick, who lives in the most absolute loneliness. His dreams, hopes, broken illusions, the breakthrough with his most intimate ones and his obsession to finish an unfinished poem of the late years of the XIX century reach a boiling point - as it were - when he accidentally meets a homeless child, an Albany's refugee and can check by himself the awful business around this insane situation. But he becomes aware that, despite of the fact this boy illuminates the last stage of his life, he has no time to take care about him. Nevertheless, among these lonely people a beautiful relationship will arise and finally will bring him back major vitality and hopes to face the life. Bruno Ganz, with his vivid performance  once more proves us why he is one of the best actors throughout the world.The superb close ups, traveling and sumptuous camera work witness why - to my view - Angelopoulos is among the top five directors in the world at the same level of Shohei Imamura, Istvan Szabo, Zang Yhimou, Francois Ozon, Mike van Diem, Pedro Almodovar or Roman Polanski, among other giants of the actual cinema.This is a coddled and mostly admired director in Cannes, and this film deserved for him the coveted golden palm in 1998. </p>

 <p> There are so many wonderful slow-paced movies out there, why waste your time on this one. An old man has no friends other than his dead wife. On what he thinks is his last day on the planet, he mopes about, reminiscing. Even the injection of a troubled boy takes too long to have much effect on Mr. Morosity.I know the Greek history, and cinematography. The long takes are indeed interesting, and the only interesting thing about this movie other than Ganz's fine acting. The transfer, BTW, is execrable.The extra film of the academic explaining the symbolic and literary antecedents was amusing and annoying: the former for its silly professorialisms; the latter for forcing ill-fitting and ultimately unnecessary parallels with Homer's Odyssey on the story.One other element of merit, however: glimpses of the desperate refugee underclass and undercurrent of human trafficking.If you like slow, predictable downers and deserted, half-constructed buildings, this film is for you! </p>

 <p> The most Bergmanesque of Angolopoulos's films. Simpler and less epic than most of his work, with fewer of his trademark breathtaking images and grand themes. Yet this story of a dying writer spending his last day before entering the hospital -- never to leave -- has a deeply elegiac melancholy, and his attempts to find meaning by saving an Albanian street urchin are often moving, if occasionally sappy. The same is true of Bruno Ganz' (unfortunately dubbed) relationship with his wife and family, told mainly in flashback. Much is moving, some is hokey and forced. But Ageloupolus' use of images to make film a poetic medium is always worth watching, even when flawed.The Greek 'New Star' disc, only available a short while, was supervised by Angelopoulos, and is an improvement over the other available discs. </p>

 <p> A dying author spends his final days reminiscing on what he sees as a failed life. His time spent wandering the gloom of Thessoloniki is interspersed with flashbacks of his wife and their home near the sea. In his wanderings around the city he meets an Albanian refugee child and the two share a few moments of friendship before each goes on to his destiny.Seen by many as Anglopoulos' reward for the tantrum he threw when &quot;Ulysses Gaze&quot; lost to Kuristica's &quot;Underground&quot; a couple of years before, the Cannes critics finally decided to give the director the Palme d'or for this film. Angelopoulos was right to be upset, his very flawed masterpiece was a much better movie than &quot;Underground,&quot; and it is also a better movie than &quot;Eternity and a Day.&quot; &quot;Eternity and a Day&quot; is a smaller film where the filmmaker tones down many of his more eccentric quirks; it is easily the most &quot;accessible&quot; film he's yet made. But Angelopoulos is not an &quot;accessible&quot; filmmaker, as anyone who has had the particular and often grueling experience of sitting through &quot;Ulysses&quot; or &quot;The Travelling Players&quot; is well aware. Whether you loved or hated those films it was impossible not to come away from them feeling that they were uncompromised visions but &quot;Eternity&quot; feels, well, like a bit of a compromise. At times it almost leans towards the maudlin or even cutesy (and it's not just because of the kid, compare with &quot;Landscape in the Mist&quot; that had not one but two kids). That being said, the film is still frequently powerful and haunting in the manner of Angelopoulos' best works. It's just that unlike his best works, this one doesn't linger in the mind.The letterboxed transfer on the VHS tape is quite nice, aptly capturing the director's vision of Thessoloniki as a murky, mist-shrouded, rain-soaked city of despair (it aint really) and the protagonist's dreams of life with his wife among the open sea and sand. </p>

 <p> Mia Aioniotitia Kai Mia Mera (Eternity and a Day) (Theo Angelopoulos, 1998)Summarizing the main plot of Theo Angelopoulos' Eternity and a Day is quite simple: Alexandre (Der Untergang's Bruno Ganz), a dying author, has decided to take his own life. On the way out of the pharmacy where he has bought the painkillers he plans to do so with, he sees the attempted abduction of a young boy (Achileas Skevis in his only feature appearance; he is now a production assistant in the TV industry), who it turns out is from Albania. Alexandre decides to help the boy, who remains unnamed throughout the film, to get back to his own country, and the two go on an absurd, endlessly-frustrating journey that would not be out of place in a Bunuel film. Along the way, perhaps, Alexandre learns a few things about life, the universe, etc. All well and good.But that doesn't tell you a blessed thing about the movie, really, which is full of flashbacks and diversions, reflections on political relations between Greece, Albania, and Turkey, ridiculously overdone scenes that seem to loom out of the mist, and then recede again (every review I've read of the film--every single one--mentioned the wedding scene, so I'm going to mention it, and then move on), etc. There's a lot of meandering that goes on here, not just on Alexandre's journey, but in the structure of the film itself. This is not a bad thing, though there did seem to be a few times when Angelopoulos was in danger of losing the plot altogether; he wasn't quite as accomplished at the whole endless-diversion thing as is, say, Kiarostami in Certified Copy (the scene towards the end with the debate over the statue would have fit right in here), but he does it well enough that the film never stops being watchable.This shouldn't be a surprise. The movie was co-written by Tonino Guerra, responsible for such plotless, meandering spectacles as L'avvenutra, Amarcord, Nostalghia, and Everybody's Fine (yes, the Robert DeNiro flick, which was actually a remake of a 1990 film by one of the world's best directors, Giuseppe Tornatore). The journey is far more important than the destination where Guerra is concerned, which is not to take anything away from the striking (though ambiguous) destination here--about which I cannot say anything without being spoilerific, obviously, except to say that it is at the same time both vaguely unsatisfying and yet entirely right. It seems to me that such a thing would be incredibly difficult to pull off, if that is the effect one were going for, but it still leaves me, well, vaguely unsatisfied. But there is much to be enjoyed here, and it is often a thing of great beauty and subtle resonance, one which should be seen. It may not be Angelopoulos' best movie--did he ever top The Travelling Players? Magic eight-ball says "probably not"--but it is still well worth checking out. *** </p>

 <p> ETERNITY AND A DAY is a Greek film about a man named Alexandre, a well known writer (played by Bruno Ganz). We meet him as he is about to enter a hospital for the terminally ill. It will be his last day, at least as he knows life, and we see him go through a number of experiences. Two significant things happen that day. First is his visit to his daughter's home where he learns that she's sold his beloved house by the sea. He gives his daughter a letter by her mother which gives us insight into Alaxandre's character and see he was a writer first, husband, lover, and father second. The second significant occurrence involves a street child (Achileas Skevis). Alexandre saves him from kidnappers and sees a life he never knew existed.The film has a number of flashback scenes where the older Alexandre returns to his past. There are also some puzzling scenes as well. Still, as a whole it's an interesting film about a man's final days as he attempts to make sense of life. We also see some touching scenes between Alexandre and the boy. The director uses the Greek scenery to its advantage. The coastal scenes are beautiful and easily evoke the images of Alexandre's happier moments. Alexandre's home seems to be a place with little life, again rather appropriate. The scenes of where the lower classes of Greece, particularly the street children, most of whom who are exiles from Albania, has the grittiness and hopelessness of life on the streets.The film is a little over two hours, and while it's not a fast paced film, it is engrossing and keeps the viewer interested. The acting in the film, particularly that of Ganz who does cause us to feel sympathetic and the endearing but never cutesy performance of Skevis is superb. It's a fine work and one that if viewed more than once will likely yield more insights about what's important in life and what we might change if we could. </p>
