 <p> Unless I try them on by myself. There is not such a thing as absolute perfect for the price like this. But I assure u guys they are pretty good for the rice u pay=its a steal. They are not gummy/rubbery ...if they would be, the sound be like underwater=the low of sound waves absorption;) The bass very surprising (powerful for this size) but not clear ,cuz u must adjust equalizer 250hz slide down from &#34;0&#34; to -3 or -6db .Enjoy.PS. they'll fit normal ears just fine; for active or idle listening. </p>

 <p> Some older Gummy earphones had a cord that was, well gummy, and tangled easily.  These have very good sound.  I mainly listen to audio books, so do not need the highest quality.  I also go through 3 pair a year, so will not invest on something that will get damaged or lost.  These do not have the base range of my Sony MDR-E818LP Fontopia Ear-Buds, but still they are very good for my purpose.  I adjusted the iPhone equalizer to bass boost for music, and I am golden.  The color is easy to find if I drop them on a trail or the street.  Add the foam cushion covers and they are so comfortable!  Good buy for the money. </p>

 <p> These headphones are great. I bought these at Walmart for $10 the other day and I am loving it. They are great for the price and they work great. They are just ordinary headphones so don't expect anything special like amazing audio but the audio quality is decent, it's great for ten dollars. They hurt my ears after a little while but that's just me. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Best earbuds for under $50 ... and they actually cost less than $10 </p>

 <p> I now own 3 pairs of these. One is my main pair. One is in my car so I can always have a pair if I need to listen to music when I'm out. And one is my backup pair in case one of these breaks.I have listened to many different earbuds and over-the-ear headphones. There are two headphones/buds I own that sound slightly better than these, but cost at least 10 times more. IMO, there are no earbuds or headphones under the $50 price tag that sound better than these JVC Gumy HA-F150 buds. These Gumy earbuds absolutely tower over Apple earbuds and Skullcandy buds (FMJ and Ink'd) in sound quality. The Gumy earbuds provide a much richer and clear sound. They produce just the right amount of bass, unlike Apple bud's underpowered bass and Skullcandy FMJ's overpowered bass. And don't even get me started on the KOSS earbuds, which are not worthy to be on the same shelf as these far-superior JVC buds.Easily worth more than their price, these Gumy earbuds should be an easy choice for you. The only setback is that they have a 3-foot cord which is a bit shorter than most competitors.One thing I should note is that I add a foam earbud cover to these, which can be purchased very cheaply on ebay.  Remember years ago when apple and other brand earbuds used to have those black, thin, spongy, foam covers around the earbuds?  Most manufacturers stopped putting them on their buds, for some reason.  Well, as it turns out, those foam pads not only help the buds stay in place but also improve the sound quality.  It should be noted that these Gumy earbuds do not sound quite as good just naked.  The foam pads help create a better seal with your outer ear and actually change the acoustics.  The foam pads help make the sound a little richer and enhance the bass just a tad. </p>

 <p> this is my second set of the same brand/model headphones... I love them... To be honest I dont take good care of them. My first set lasted for a little more than a year.. They still work but the one speaker cracks slighly in songs with alot of bass... and thats from listening to them blasting for over a year. I still use my first set for when i goto the gym or doing stuff outside like yard work... I bought this set for when Im sitting around the house relaxing. The sound quality is excellent. Im 100% satisfied... and they come in cool colors. hahaha... Ive bought alot of headphones in the past and price shopped... come across alot of junky sounding ones. but these are actually great especially for the price. you wont be disappointed. </p>

 <p> I brought these for my husband because I was VERY pleased with my pair.  . he loves them but I find them a little uncomfortable because they are large without cushioning like mine so if you're purchasing for someone small these may not work . I was surprised of the high quality of them for the price . When wearing mine I can't hear a thing around me </p>

 <p> These are light weight and very comfortable. The sound quality is as good as Apple - maybe better! And at a much lower price. Sorry it may be discontinued. I would heartily recommend them to anyone interested in earpods. </p>

 <p> These are not red, they are pink. That is the only reason why they get a bad rating.I love gummy headphones. I think that this brand of JVC is the best value for a little bit of money. I usually replace them or lose them every six months to a year, but it is much better than putting $30-$40 into a pair of earbuds. </p>

 <p> These have been another good pair of gumies. Would buy again; much cheaper than going to wal-mart to purchase these buds. Would have been $ 10.00 instead of 6.00 </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I've had two other pairs of JVC Gumy headphones over the last 8 years and they are long lasting. I've destroyed other types of headphones easily. My last non-gumy headphone's literally busted and had the lone surviving earbud hanging by a wire. These earphones could last an eternity if I didn't lose them every 3 or 4 years. Great product! </p>
