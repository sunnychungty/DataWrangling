 <p> I did not like this version.  It reads nothing like the catholic bible I have.  The wording is different and I found it hard to follow.  Example instead of talking about Love it uses the word Charity. ( 1 Corinthians 13 ). There are other areas that are written different also.  I would like to have my money returned and the book removed from my kindle.  I do not recommend this version. </p>

 <p> Was easy to read and with my reader READING with me everything just seemed to come more to life for me. Revelation is a great book and I will be going through this Bible again. I am a Catholic newly confirmed and this is the first time I have read any Catholic Bible much less an electronic device. </p>

 <p> Love it! </p>

 <p> I bought this bible download on my Kindle for the voice readback. Looking up chapters is fine. The voice option unfortunatly constantly repeats the chapter and verse which is annoying. If you read it, it's fine. </p>

 <p> I don't know if it is the Kindle or the format of the Bible, but this really isn't very easy to use. </p>

 <p> See heading...  tried to look up passages from my daily scripture booklet and could not find them.  It stays on my Kindle but I'm not really using it too much anymore. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Not a complete edition </p>

 <p> I like this bible.  It's very easy to find the passage that I want to read even faster than if I were using a real book.  The only issue I think I might have is looking like I'm showing off my Android pad in church.  For that reason alone, I'm considering buying a paper book.  I will surely reference this version more often, since it's so easy to use, even when the lights are off. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Great bible and easy to search </p>
