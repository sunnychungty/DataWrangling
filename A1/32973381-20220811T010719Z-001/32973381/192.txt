 <p> At the end, this movie is just like the summer, you'll find that you hate to see it go away.  It's a movie about summer worth viewing all year round.It is about what every good summer vacation is about:  Everything and anything, but nothing specific.  Just seeking to have as much fun as possible.  Play, lust, love,... whatever.  Maybe one or two things that later seem a bit reckless?  Why not?  So throw yourself into this film with the same reckless abandon, and just let it take you wherever it takes you.  And don't worry, whatever these two guys do won't go on their permanent records!Everyone can find some connection to this flick, whatever their age or sexuality.  It's about a carefree time of life that seems almost too long while it lasts, and ever so fleeting and lost once it's gone away.  A time when we are content to simply see how things play out and live them without undue concern for the outcomes nor any serious consequences for missteps along the way.For teens, it's what every summer promises to be.  For those is their twenties, it's what summers used to be just a short time ago.  For everyone else, it's a salient recollection of what summers used to be, long ago.Other good movies in this genre:  "Come Undone"  which I've reviewed on Amazon, and that review cites yet another good title. </p>

 <p> The awkward sex and makeout scenes only add to the low-key appeal of this Spanish film with two young male leads who are far from photogenic. I was surprised by the frank treatment of adolescent discovery of sexuality. There's a great soundtrack, and some lovely scenes of the Spanish beach life that most Americans never see. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> This is another film that has been touted as the next "Beautiful Thing," but it was not the director's intention to make a love story like that.  Rather, this is a series of snapshots of a few days in the lives of two Spanish boys who are heading down different forks in the road.  Though clocked at 90 minutes the movie speeds by in seemingly half that time.Nico is coming to visit Dani at the coast while Dani's parents are away; he is intending to do the same thing he would do if he stayed home in Barcelona, went to Rome, or, for that matter, orbited in the Space Shuttle:  chase skirts.  Dani has begun to hear the tapping of a different drummer and has apparently had a lot of time to plan all the ways he wants to share his new interests with his long time pal.  Clearly these two have been very close.  Krammpack (mutual masturbation), the original title of the play, is not just something they've read about in magazines.The movie is a series of fast moving vignettes of the two boys and the two girls they meet and interact with.  They move from incident to incident quickly, not lingering long nor introspecting much about what has happened.  Though the age of the two is not clear (I've read as young as 15, as old as 17) it is made clear they are both virgins and minors (in much of Europe, 16 is the age of consent).There are some unsettling undertones as Dani experiments with sexuality, mas or menos, oblivious for some time to the fact Nico is increasingly uncomfortable with the moves he is putting on him.  There is a very unsettling, for me, date rape scene, involving the hoary old concoction Spanish Fly, not the modern date rape drug DHA.  The movie remains non-judgemental.  Director Cesc Gay keeps things from getting too heavy both by not lingering on any one incident and with musical punctuation and title cards reminscent of silent films that foreshadow upcoming scenes.  The music in the film is excellent.Nico is played by Jordi Villachi and he is a real charmer.  Though not blessed with extraordinary good looks, it is nevertheless easy to see why Dani and Elena and Berta are drawn to him.  Dani is a very handsome young man, played by Fernando Ramalla with an intensity that is at times eerie.  He is struggling with more difficult issues than Nico, of course, and has anticipated that he is facing almost certain frustration of his desires.When the two go their separate ways one evening Dani, in a lover's snit, tries tarting an older man, which is a cake walk for him, but the better angels of his nature prevail.The movie ends positively; the two's friendship survives the stresses.  Nobody is thrown into therapy nor denounced from the pulpit for their misdeeds.  Nico hasn't given up on chasing skirts and Dani has learned a lot about what he wants, as well as what he doesn't want.  The worst that Nico can bring himself to say of his friend is that he is selfish.I gave the movie four stars but if the system would have let me, I would have given it another 1/4 or 1/2 star, and if it continues to wear well with repeated viewing, as I think it will, I'll be upgrading my rating in a few months.  Nico and Dani is not "Romeo and Julian," nor is it even "Jaime and Ste," but it's a lot closer to them that it is to American Pie, and it's a very good movie. </p>

 <p> The movie Nico and Dani really transforms the age of clumsy ackwardness known as purberty into a gentle movie of developing characters. Nico and Dani being both sixteen start experimenting but as Nico is drawn closer to women, it is Dani who finds himself attracted more to men (Nico in particular). The story finds both Nico and Dani's friendship tested by conflicting and confusing emotions.Director Cesc Gay does a wonderful job of retaining the crudeness and roughness of the actors which only creates a greater sense of innocence, charm and ackwardness of this tender coming of age tale. Nico and Dani were cast perfectly as the two skinny, gangly young friends and the use of Spain, as the background, adds to a carefree time between the youngsters interacting lives. I think the movie will touch some memory in everyones life when they had that first crush, first kiss and first hormone explosion that caused many teenagers to be daring and fearless. </p>

 <p> The two leads are effective, but this is a teen film and not a good one.However, the relationship between the two leads is worth seeing because of the not so clear feelings that arise.  But the film does not delve into the questions it raises about how male teen sexuality is a confusing place even for those who know exactly where they stand on the gay/straight divide.RENT it and be prepared to sit through quite a bit of ... to get to the so-so stuff. </p>

 <p> Dani (Fernando Ramallo) and Nico (Jordi Vilches) are two teenage friends who spend one summer together in the seaside near Barcelona. They are skinny, a bit awkward and average in looks, a lot like a lot of sixteen or seventeen-year-old boys who are experimenting with sex with each other and with girls. It may be just a phase that Nico is going through but Dani figures out, and is comfortable with his feelings, that he would rather spend time with Nico than with anyone else. As he tells Nico on one occasion: "I would watch you all day long." The film is in no way exploitive and shouldn't offend the most conservative of viewers. The sex between the young men hardly exists; the small amount of nudity is tastefully done. The naturalism of the film is refreshing and totally believable.The two young men spend a lot of time on the beach in scenes that are beautifully filmed in this sweet coming-of-age film that will not disappoint you. </p>

 <p> I was never this lucky in my youth, so I don't speak from experience.  Still, I was pleasantly surprised by this film.  First, many say there's not enough work about gay youth and this fills that void, given the fear that some cultures have about teen sexuality, and specifically male-on-male action.  Many people say actions come before identfications.  There are adults who are far different from the children they were "playing doctor."  This movie shows what happens as boys who mess around start to have a sexual identity and that sometimes this leads to two divergent paths.  Many accounts say that boys fool around until somebody says something homophobic and the boys are faced with harsh reality.  Imagine if the couple in "Brokeback Mountain" were teens, rather  than adults.  Some of those same tensions and realities are present here.This work is realistic in that it features two pimply, fun-chasing, law-breaking teens.  However, in US cinema, actors who aren't cute rarely get parts.  It was shocking to see such average-looking persons in leading roles.I wish my own country could come up with works this daring and true-to-life. </p>

 <p> I loved this movie.  It is refreshingly NOT like American coming-of-age movies, which I avoid like the plague.  The underlying tension between Nico and Dani over a summer's visit is a constant theme, one that can certainly be familiar to gay people.  So much of the time, teenage gay movies either tend to be maudlin, mushy or just plain depressing.  This movie is none of those.  Another refreshing aspect of the film is that it doesn't try to tie all the loose ends up at the end of the film. I bought the movie and viewed it without reading all the reviews because wanted to view it fresh without preconceptions, and I won't detail it any more than this. It is light as a feather in many ways, which was what I was looking for.  I bought the DVD and recommend that any other buyer look at the interviews with Cesc Gay and the main cast members after seeing the movie.  Another point:  the movie I received was "unrated" but I have no idea why this would even be R-rated.  There was no gratuitous nudity, only a topless girl in one scene.  I think the censors must've gone overboard on this one.  Highly recommended. </p>

 <p> Real rating: 4.5 starsGreat movie! Nothing so amazing that you will walk away wanting to move to Spain, but still a must-see! Maybe the cinematography wasn't the most impressive in the history of the big screen: but who cares? How many of us really give a bother about the 'cinematography of a film' if we come out feeling happy?Nico and Dani (Kr&aacute;mpack) is a great "Coming to terms, yadda yadda yadda" movie that doesn't overdo it with anything. The angst, the sex, the resentment, etc is not overdone in any part.Had the director used gorgeous actors with rippling muscles, it too would have taken away from the film. The two characters portray with perfection: two young Spanish boys, not particularly attractive, quite awkward, and definitely not 'sexy' in the modaren-gay sense.Nico never falls for Dani, Dani doesn't try to kill himself or gets thrown out of home: sure many of us go through a lot of bother when we come out, but sometimes it IS this easy! It definitely gives a true portayal of the socially accepting attitude Spaniards have to gay men (All about my mother was a huge hit remember!).I got scared toward the end at the train station, I thought perhaps that the movie might take a Hollywood twist and Nico might grab Dani and kiss him! Thank goodness this is a European film, and he does not.Definitely get this movie. It is so worth the money to see it over and over again.Before I conclude I must mention the great supporting cast as I think noone has as yet: Marianne the Cook, Sonia the Teacher and of course Julian! (from My Mother Likes Women!). Every piece of this movie is tied together so well...can you tell I liked it?! :) </p>

 <p> This film is about what two 15/16 year old males do when left to their own devices.  This takes place in Spain and the twist is one of the boys begins to fall for the other. I could see an American version of this turning into American Pie 3 but not in this Spanish version.  All aspects of the film are handled in a sensitive and realistic way.  The natural awkwardness and shyness of the boys combined with their very childlike excitement of being on their own comes across as very natural.  The young actors did a great job.  This is a great buddy film and if you liked Wild reeds or Beautiful Thing you will like this film. </p>

 <p> Dani, who belongs to an affluent family somewhere on the southern coast of Spain, gets a summertime visit from his old friend Nico.  They hit on some girls at Nico's insistence without giving up their old pastime of krampack.  When Dani realizes that he is in love with Nico, he begins acting like an idiot: he grabs at Nico's privates when he is having sex with a girl, tells the girl that Nico is really a maricon, then pushes himself onto the local mature, sophisticated writer but runs out before they hit the bedroom.What I find insulting about this film is that the boys never say the "gay" word, but they express their hatred of "maricones" quite often. I don't mind the director trying to pretend that gay history and culture don't exist, but it is offensive to tell a story about same-sex love that simulataneously preaches hatred of gay people. </p>

 <p> I saw the movie on cable and then bought the dvd to show to my friends who do not speak english, only spanish.  After seeing it the second time I asked my self why?  It is a fun little movie, but once is enough.  I only bring it out when I have guests that do not speak english, only spanish, to show them that experimentation is part of growing up. </p>

 <p> This was a fun, simple flick about two teenage friends spending the summer together, doing what boys do. The film focuses on the decisions they make, their responses to hormones, the future, girls, drugs, each other...The acting is great, the characters likeable, and well-developed. If you enjoyed Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN then you should have no trouble getting into this one. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> If you had asked me what I had thought of the movie half way through, I would have said I was slightly uneasy with it as a whole. What I mean to say is that there are just a few parts that you might catch your mind rejecting as too frank. I found myself identifying completely with the characters on my screen, and yet at the same moment feeling uneasy for some reason...Luckily, I didn't stop half way through and the story worked itself out and developed into something to be remembered. As soon as the credits began to roll, I realized the reason I had an uneasy feeling was because the acting was so natural and real that I felt as if I was there, and since this is a coming of age story it brought back the same feelings I felt when I was going through the things I saw on screen.The story is well written as a whole and portrays every character as actual people, even those with a smaller role. Nothing is over dramatized, and nothing is boring. It's life, shown in a way you usually don't see on film and showing an important part of life.Another reviewer didn't see much in the cinematography, but I enjoyed it. Many times, the unique "set ups" and irony that you see when a play is performed on stage is lost when it is made for cinema, but the director did an excellent job of preserving it. Make sure and watch the "Special Features" after the film and you'll see what I mean. Not necessarily things you will consciously notice while watching the film, but they work to make the film what it is.Others have said it is homophobic, which is true to a point. But I -like most- don't look back on my experiences as an adolescent and think how reaffirming everyone was and how sure I was about everything that I did. Homophobia is a reality for many people in their life and this movie doesn't brush that under the carpet for atmosphere.If you've seen a lot of gay cinema, you will be pleased to know this is anything but the "same old thing" and I recommend it with 4 stars. If you're just exploring gay themed movies, you might should add this one to your wish list and check back after you've seen Beautiful Thing, The Priest, The Trip, etc. </p>
