 <p> This is just a great lot of fun! Sophie Marceau is the daughter of a Musketeer (Philippe Noiret) who has inherited much of his swashbuckling talent. The aged musketeers reassemble to thwart an assassination attempt, and all ends well. High production values and a bunch of great French actors. Not deeply thought provoking, but a dandy way to blow off an evening. </p>

 <p> Note: French with English subtitles.There's a conspiracy afoot in France that has inadvertantly spread from the Royal Court of the King into the surrounding countryside, bringing death and destruction to a distant convent. One of the residence of this religious community happens to be Eloise (Sophie Marceau), the daughter of the famous musketeer D'Artagan.After the murder of the Reverend Mother, Eloise leaves the convent, returning to Paris to find her Father (Philippe Noiret) in the hope of convincing him to use his fighting skills to bring the culprits to justice. As you might have guessed, this turns out to be a job that will require more than one musketeer. Soon D'Artagan and Eloise are joined by Porthos (Raoul Billerey), Aramis (Sami Frey) and Athos (Jean-Luc Bideau) and the battle is on.This was a boring movie. Instead of making an action / adventure film directors Travernier and Blossier opted for a comedy. What's worse, it wasn't funny. Watching four old men who could barely walk pretend to fight off large numbers of younger and faster foes was a real stretch of the imagination. It just didn't work at all. Too bad, because the production values were first rate.The only real energy in this production was generated by the charming Sophie Marceau. If not for her presence this film would have been impossible for me to finish. Thanks for being there Sophie. </p>

 <p> La Fille de D'Artagnan was a success in Europe but never got much of a release in the U.S. When the American DVD came out it had a new name, Revenge of the Musketeers. Too bad more people didn't see it. It's a great swashbuckling movie with lots of sword play, shrewd comedy, a clever story and fine acting.It's the mid-Seventeenth Century in France. Eloise D'Artagnan (Sophie Marceau) is a young woman being educated in a convent when it is attacked and the mother superior killed. She learns there is a plot afoot, vows revenge and sets off to Paris to find her father (Philippe Noiret) and to reunite him with Athos, Aramis and Porthos. The plot thickens as they find not only evil noblemen and a cruel lady in red but that the 16-year-old king himself is in danger.The humor and good nature of the film has a lot to do with the aging three musketeers and D'Artagnan. They've become middle aged, some a bit portly. They've all retired or resigned from the musketeers years ago. They find endless horseback riding and climbing walls no longer the easy action of their youth. Yet although they might get a bit tired sword fighting, they still are the best around...which they prove on ship decks, in castle hallways, and on Paris roofs.Sophie Marceau does a wonderful job as the passionate and funny Eloise. She has no desire to simply wear skirts and get married as her father wishes. She's devoted to the idea of justice and righting the wrongs that have been committed. She loves her father and is proud of his comrades. She also finds she often has to protect the poet who loves her. He may write wonderful verse, but he can't use a sword and can barely ride a horse. Marceau throws herself into the role. Eloise may not be the best sword fighter around (she has plans for lessons from her father), but she energetically skewers those who try to confront her. Marceau leaps onto tables and horses, and also manages to land on her bottom in the mud and the dirt. She's an actress who is not afraid to get dirty or look disheveled.This is an amusing movie with a lot of sword play. Marceau and Noiret are great. I liked it a lot. The DVD picture and audio are fine and the yellow subtitles are easy to read. </p>

 <p> The whole premise behind the 570 musketeer films that have been released thus far (Dec. 2003) is pretty flimsy, and the premise behind this one is among the flimsiest.BUT--for people who like to watch adventure-comedies in which beautiful women kick butt, this belongs on your shelf beside the CHARLIE'S ANGELS films.The chief advantage this film has over other members of this genre is that it stars the ever-adorable Sophie Marceau. We get to see her fence with evil-doers and have a tender moment or two with her aging father, the famous D'Artagnan. The script is better than average, and the film contains many other scenes that are enjoyable in various ways.In sum, if you happen to like musketeer films, this one is far better than the half dozen big-budget productions that have come out of Hollywood in the past few years. (Sorry, Leonardo. Yours stank, despite its high-powered cast.)Finally, in case you want to watch this with your grandparents, you should be aware that the heroine has a brief topless scene that might give somebody a heart attack. </p>

 <p> I've only ever seen Sophie Marceau in English-speaking roles before, and, while I thought she was a fine actress, it wasn't until I saw her in her native French milieu that I duly became impressed. REVENGE OF THE MUSKETEERS is a Sophie Marceau vehicle all the way; the scenes are never more delightful than when she graces the screen. I enjoyed her infectious enthusiasm as she threw herself fully into the role of the headstrong, adventurous Eloise D'Artagnan. Philippe Noiret was also noteworthy as the grizzled D'Artagnan, father of Eloise, now retired in disgrace from the ranks of the Musketeers. The rest of the cast was excellent, as well, with special mention going out to Sami Frey (Aramis), Gigi Proietti (Cardinal Mazarin), and Claude Rich (Duke of Crassac).The convent in which the young Eloise D'Artagnan is being fostered is assaulted by swordsmen led by a woman in red. The Mother Superior is murdered and, in the aftermath of the attack, Eloise finds a blooded document, which she believes is the key to uncovering a deadly plot. She goes to Paris in search of her famous father, D'Artagnan, whom she hadn't seen in years, and finds him happy to see her but disinclined to believe her tale. However, certain events occur which alter D'Artagnan's thinking, who then decides to involve his old comrades. When you add to that mix a lovestruck but combat-ignorant poet, a one-eyed spy, a duplicitous femme fatale, an ambitious duke, a conniving cardinal, a slave ring, and coffee, well, somewhere in there, there just HAS to be a conspiracy in the offing, right? Right. There is a conspiracy and it's that same old conspiracy again, namely, to assassinate the monarch of France. But, thanks to the not-quite-decrepit ex-Musketeers and the resolute Eloise - who is powered by a sense of honor and justice, even if she's a bit lacking in the finer points of fencing - the King of France is in good hands.A bit reminiscent of Richard Lester's THE THREE MUSKETEERS (1973), the lighthearted storyline proficiently toes the line between swashbuckling and comedy. The sword fights aren't that exemplary, but the film does have an out in that the main protagonists consist of a girl raw with the sword and four curmudgeonly, even arthritic, blades. But, what they lack in speed and dexterity, they make up for in enthusiasm and elderly flair. The comedy is superb and is nicely meshed within the story. I got a kick out of the fact that each of the opposing parties come upon innocuous messages (one a laundry list, the other a poem) that they think are in secret code and end up wasting much of the movie attempting to decode them. One of the verbal high points is when Aramis is apprised of yet another plot to kill the king; he remarks with an offended "But that's so dated!" Another is when, after Sophie has the frustrated villain, Crassac, at an impasse in their deadly swordfight, he asks her if her blade was longer than his. And then, of course, there's all those elderly jokes, as offered by the aged D'Artagnan and his cohorts.So, here's what we got: misunderstandings, behind-the-throne machinations, high adventure and swordplays, low and high-brow comedy, a father-daughter relationship, the return of classic Dumas characters, and the introduction of a lovely and fiery heroine - Eloise D'Artagnan. Which brings us full circle to Sophie Marceau. As I've said, this is her vehicle. She displays full commitment and brings beauty, unaffected charm, and unfettered zest to the table. Her Eloise doesn't mind getting muddy or physically exerting herself; she athletically jumps on and rides horses, leaps on tables, violently slings furniture, and recklessly brandishes a sword. The only thing she doesn't do is swing on chandeliers, though I have no doubt she would've done that with gusto, as well. </p>

 <p> There should be more than five stars to rate this movie. Philippe Noiret as usual is wonderful, including the beautiful Sophie Marceau of &quot;Brave Heart&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream.&quot; The great Charlotte Kady has the best role in the film which regrettably should have been longer. </p>

 <p> The spirit of Dumas is alive and well as D'Artagnan and his three legendary companions regroup and once again go forth in defense of the Crown in "Revenge of the Musketeers," directed by Bertrand Tavernier.  This time around, however, it's D'Artagnan's daughter, Eloise (Sophie Marceau), who sounds the alarm after witnessing a cold-blooded murder at the convent she has called home these many years, having been raised there while her father was off on one adventure after another in service to the King.  And it's the King for whom Eloise is concerned; in the wake of the murder, she has uncovered a conspiracy to assassinate the about-to-be-crowned Louis XIV during his coronation.  Her evidence is a cryptic message discovered among the personal effects of the recently deceased resident of the convent.  So throwing caution to the wind, Eloise takes to horseback, alone, to seek out her father and inform him of this threat to France and the King.  What she doesn't know is that D'Artagnan (Philippe Noiret) has recently withdrawn from the service of the King, and not by his own choosing.  It seems that the King-to-be is something of an upstart, the fact of which D'Artagnan conveyed to him personally-- in no uncertain terms-- after which the now former Musketeer retired to private life to give lessons in the art of swordsmanship.  All of which is about to change with the arrival of the daughter he hasn't seen for many years, and who to his knowledge is still safely ensconced in the convent.To successfully present yet another episode of "The Three Musketeers," it must have that certain sense of bold carelessness born of confidence and larger-than-life adventure, and Tavernier's film has it.  Though it takes a couple of scenes to find it's legs after an intense opening that makes you sit up and take notice, when it finally kicks in (which it does fairly quickly) it becomes a rousing adventure steeped in the tradition of it's predecessors.  And, as in the best of the "Musketeer" movies, it's laced with subtle humor and intrigue.  Tavernier sets a pace that is at times inconsistent, but he provides enough action and fun that it can be easily overlooked; it may threaten to stall occasionally, but never actually does.Philippe Noiret cuts a striking figure as the aging D'Artagnan, who though slowed somewhat by the years, is still one of the best swords around.  He successfully embodies that spirit and sense of "legend" that makes his D'Artagnan believable, and delivers it all with the confidence befitting his character.The highlight of the film, however, is the lovely Marceau, who as Eloise proves that she can cross swords with the best of them.  Her technique with a blade may be a bit awkward at times, but it gives credibility to the character; a young woman raised in a convent-- even the daughter of a famed Musketeer-- wouldn't necessarily be a master swordsman.  And Marceau gives a lively performance as Eloise, diving into the action with a reckless abandon that makes her endearing, as well as fun to watch.  She has a radiant screen presence that draws the eye to her, even in a crowded scene.  But what really puts this character across-- and again, the entire film, for that matter-- is that unabashed spirit of adventure, which Marceau manifests in Eloise.The supporting cast includes Claude Rich (Crassac), Sami Frey (Aramis), Jean-Luc Bideau (Athos), Raoul Billerey (Porthos), Charlotte Kady (Eglantine de Rochefort), Nils Tavernier (Quentin), Luigi Proietti (Mazarin) and Jean-Paul Roussillon (Planchet).  Proving that even Musketeers beyond their prime can be engaging, especially when combined with a spirited beauty like Marceau, "Revenge of the Musketeers" is a welcome cinematic chapter in the saga Dumas began so many years ago.  In the end, it's a satisfying experience that will transport you to another place and another time, when chivalry was alive and well, and right always triumphed over wrong. </p>

 <p> Marceau Carries The Day </p>

 <p> After a slow start, Revenge of the Musketeers (originally released in France as La Fille de D'Artagnan) picks up some dash and humor by the second half and leaves the viewer credibly entertained.  There are good performances from all the cast (except a fairly colorless love-interest for Marceau's Eloise), who seem to be enjoying themselves immensely.  The lovely Sophie Marceau gets to parade in a variety of flattering cavalier costumes and the villains are full of bravado and duplicity as befits these sort of romps.  Messieurs Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan may be twenty years older than in their heyday, but they still have plenty of fight in them, and when the headstrong daughter of D'Artagnan  unmasks a nasty conspiracy -- or IS it? -- they race into action once again for France and King Louis.The production is top-notch and Marceau's Eloise suitably steals the show, giving perhaps the best swordswoman display since Kim Cattrall's Justine in Richard Lester's "Return of the Musketeers", which this film most resembles. (Close runner-up: Catherine Zeta-Jones in "The Mask of Zorro.") The pace seems less than dynamic, perhaps due in part to the strange lack of a musical score to complement the action -- you'll appreciate just how much the soundtrack can add to a scene when you watch these au naturel  fights and duels.  But on the whole, this was better than I'd expected  and eminently watchable, with a fine spirit that even bursts out of the closing credits.  En garde, mes braves! A cheval! (Add an extra star if you truly love films of this genre.) </p>

 <p> Revenge of the Musketeers is an enjoyable movie to watch.  Typical swashbuckler.  The special treat is that this is one of the few movies I've ever found where Sophie Marceau does a nude scene!  The scene is very tasteful and very, very funny and so appropriate for the movie.  If you're a Three Musketeers fan at all, I think you'll enjoy this movie. </p>
