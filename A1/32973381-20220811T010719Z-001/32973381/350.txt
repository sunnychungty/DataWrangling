<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Two-faced authors, supporting government regulation only when it suits their arguments </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I can't judge the accuracy of the book with regard to China's military ambitions and the threat that they pose, but these guys definitely don't want to worry about small things such as about logical consistency. It is ironic that the authors, one of them an editor for the supposedly free market Washington Times, is all for the government protecting consumers from bad companies.  How many editorials has the Washington Times published lavishing praise on the FDA for protecting American consumers?  My guess is zero.  Yet, on page 134 of the book the authors rely on the FDA protecting consumers from Chinese companies.What about the book's complaints about China being able to sell Americans cheap things because of the lack of workplace protections?  Are we going to see the Washington Times running editorials soon praising the work that OSHA has done to protect American workers?Also what is the ethics deal at the Washington Times?  Is it normal journalistic practice for people who work for Brett Decker to write glowing reviews of their boss's book without mentioning that they are his employees?  Mastio and Robbins ought to be ridiculed in the media for posting such reviews without making it clear that they work for him.Given how absolutely horrible the economics is here, I am dubious about other points that they make. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Read this book. You will learn that we are at war with a super-power.We are at war with China and getting our clock cleaned.Read this book. It is the saddest, most painful book I've read in years. It is crammed full of information describing the malevolence and the aggressive intentions of China toward our country. You and I are in their crosshairs and we are buying them the bullets to shoot us.Much sadder and more painful is the mirror that the authors hold up to a USA that has no self-control. With tough love, Decker and Triplett show us ourselves. Our reflection, clear and contemptible, is of a USA that is facing extinction as a result of our devotion to a deformed capitalism characterized by amoral greed, our backward thinking on what constitutes the weapons that defend our nation, our dearth of patriotism to our fellow citizens and their jobs, and our Dodo bird stupidity.Read this book then connect the dots. See if you agree that the book's facts about the People's Republic of China indicate that, in important ways, they have already taken over our country. China has intimidated our leaders into silence. Much worse, as is the focus of this book, President Obama is, in practice, their ally against us.Our greed is their ammo in a clever weapon system. They are using our beloved "free trade" capitalism against us, recognizing it as the romantic seduction fantasy it has always been.Another of China's weapon systems, as this book amply documents, are armies of professional government hackers that have already successfully tested their ability to take down the networks and information systems that are the heart of our government, financial, and commercial systems. Any second China decides to amuse themselves, they can thrust our entire society into a catatonic state. We would suddenly be starving masses, without organization, or even awareness of each other. Face it, they don't need us, just the land. We would die quickly of exposure or disease. Backward-looking people like us should remember that disease has always been war's most deadly weapon.Read this book and weep.We have fallen deeply in love with an amoral and unpatriotic capitalism at the same time we have fallen out of love with ourselves and with our God.It is said that generals always fight the last war, especially if they have won it. Our deluded idea of what constitutes contemporary weapons of war amounts to belief in a Maginot Line. I have seen the enemy's face. He is in Walmart buying a weapon for his enemy to use against him. It is a vanity mirror made in China. The face in the mirror is mine.The last line in the book reads; "America's future is in our hands." OK. Is it too late for a 180 degree turn? </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This election year is full of hot button issues, but not necessarily the most serious issues.  The politicians seek issues that will move public opinion in their favor.  There are some issues with very complex and difficult answers that they avoid talking about because talking about complex issues always leaves you vulnerable to a demagogue who is willing to pound on you with simplistic bumper sticker statements.China is a complex issue, but more complex than it really needs to be.  And complicated further by the obeisant attitude of President Obama and his administration to all things China.  This terrific book by Decker and Triplett take us through the serious issues facing America in regards to China.The authors take us through Obama's weakness towards China, explain how the new China really works, who makes up the Ruling Class and how their supposedly embracing Capitalism is really organized Cronyism with family and friends of the in-crowd getting most of the spoils.We also get a look on the way China is using the money we send them to rapidly build their armed forces and what that can mean to us as China extends its influence and projects power with their more powerful military onto Korea, Taiwan, against Japan, and other nations surrounding China.  And why we will be incapable of doing much about it.While all nations spy on each other, China is actively stealing not only state secrets, but commercial secrets, patents, and research.  The author's also warn of an "electronic Pearl Harbor" if China attacks our defense department's computer systems in order to render us impotent in the face of their military action somewhere in the world.  Think Taiwan.If you think the economics are bad for the U.S. compared to China now, imagine what will happen if Obama gets re-elected and we pile on another five or six trillion in debt.  Add to that China's rapid growth rate (if they can sustain it) and the weakening of the U.S. dollar because of our printing far too many of them and you end up with a China that is too strong for us to challenge.  We cannot assume we will always be the strongest nation.  We have to work for that status.  Obama is actively seeking us being a peer nation in the world.China is also using our own system against us.  They are hiring lobbyists, public opinion consultants, and other agents to influence out Federal and State politicians to influence policy, laws, and regulations in their favor.  They are also reaching into our Universities to influence their policies and what they teach about China to our students.Opinion makers and "thought leaders" (a term I despise) on the Left love to peddle the Post-America world.  It need not be that way despite their fondest hopes.  We can win back our future.  But each of us needs to get educated and wise up.  Then we need to fight back against these efforts including putting in place better politicians and ensuring that our private corporations aren't selling us out for their own benefit.Please read this book.Reviewed by Craig Mattes, Saline, MI </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Persuasive on the Chinese Threat but Not on Obama's Role </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I found Decker and Triplett's "Bowing to Beijing" to be a very informative book on the growing dangers that China poses to the U.S. Unfortunately, the book shows an unnecessary bias at times. However, in spite of this, Decker and Triplett are ultimately persuasive in portraying the dangers of China. In fact, they succeeded in making me revise my understanding of China in an important way, which I'll describe below. They are much less successful in portraying how President Obama has helps hasten Chinese domination.Decker and Triplett are at their best when they objectively chronicle the ways in which China is a threat to the U.S. On this most important issue, they are very persuasive as they catalog only a partial list of ways in which China threatens the U.S. One of the best sections of the book is the first one, which deals with the "New China" Myth. The "New China" Myth is that China is gradually emerging as a more modern and progressive society. According to this myth, if the U.S. keeps trading with China and making them rich, eventually we'll convince them of the virtues of a free capitalist society.This is the one major area where the book made me revise my beliefs about China. I remember teaching high school economics and government years ago, and I taught that China was on a collision course with itself. The new freedom of Chinese capitalism couldn't co-exist forever with the old Chinese oppressive Communism. I cautiously predicted that the taste of capitalism would eventually cause the Chinese to gradually become capitalistic - either that or ruthlessly regress to a more purely Communist state. But after reading "Bowing to Beijing," I now believe that China can continue to do what it's currently doing: allow a crony capitalism which benefits a lot of people to some degree but mostly aggrandizes the power of a relatively few elite families.The facts are that China still does not have a great deal of religious freedom or freedom of the press. Property rights exist primarily to enrich the elites, and the right to life is not valued much in Communist China. The key to understanding why capitalism as we know it in the U.S. will not be likely to transform China for the better is that the economy is tightly controlled by a hereditary oligarchy called "the Princelings." This group of 200-300 descendants of the original Communist Party members are the primary beneficiaries of economic wealth and political power.Other useful information in "Bowing to Beijing" includes a discussion of the growing Chinese militarization. This includes not only a growing military expenditure but also a smuggling axis of arms of which China is a part. Just as unsettling is the way in which China is virtually declaring war on the U.S. through stealing and spying. In the last 3 years more than 60 Americans have been prosecuted for spying for China. Also, China has been attacking computer systems in the U.S., as well as stealing a lot of American technology.The chapter on how the U.S. has become economically dependent on China is well known material, but I'm still glad they included it. A final chapter on how many American political leaders are unduly influenced by Chinese money and power was newer material to me and among some of the most disturbing in the entire book.There are 2 things that keep the book from being a 5-star book. I would like to give it three and a half stars, but I'll round it up to four. First, there are some places where the authors unnecessarily seem biased against President Obama. I don't mind if they sharply criticize him, but some of the attitude towards him seems gratuitous in a book of this nature. More substantially, I find part of the major premise of the book - that Obama is hastening America's demise and Chinese domination - to be relatively lacking in substance. If the book were portrayed a book speaking generally of China's growing threat it would have been more satisfying. As it is, there are a few pages here and there where details are given about how Obama or his administration are either ignoring the Chinese threat or purposely obscuring it. But there is not nearly enough of this information, given that one of the premises of the book is precisely that Obama is actively facilitating the Chinese threat. If that's the claim of the book, then more evidence should be concluded.In summary, the book is a good overview of the Chinese threat but fails to establish Obama's role in this as much as it should have. </p>

 <p> A very readable MUST READ on America's #1 problem! </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Bowing to Beijing is a stunning indictment of the Obama administration's failed foreign policy backed by the frightening details of an America caught in a geopolitical death spiral carefully engineered by the Chinese Communist Party. Brett M. Decker and William C. Triplett, II have chosen to pull no punches as they line up the specifics of China's unyielding attack on America's economy, values, and military position and point them straight at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.While the details themselves are extremely engaging - the amazing stories of Chinese shenanigans via its puppet state in North Korea alone are worth the price alone - the power of this book is it the way it boldly ties all these tales of communist misbehavior into a package that leaves no doubt as to their purpose: total destruction of American power and values.Bowing to Beijing is an extremely partisan book to be sure. If you're a red blooded Republican or Tea Party member you will bask in the light of each explosive page. If you're a open minded liberal, and perhaps once a fan of Mr. Obama's flowery rhetoric and charismatic podium personality you will certainly be quickly offended, but if you dare to read on and are willing to accept damning facts for what they are, you will be shaken to your core. You will also find that there is plenty of blame to go around for communist apologists both sides of the aisle.I read every major book on China and frankly some of them are a long, hard slog to get through (are you listening Mr. Kissinger?). Bowing to Beijing is sharp, tight, readable book that could and should shake the political arena in 2012, where China policy will be the biggest issue. When you are done, pass this book along or buy two copies and mail one to Washington or your state capital. Chalk one up for the "blue team!"-Greg Autry, coauthor ofDeath by China: Confronting the Dragon - A Global Call to Action </p>

 <p> I just love these books. Whose brilliant idea was it to have Ted nugent write a glowing review. Hint: he's a rock musician. Most of them are real dummies. My antipathy towards nugent goes beyond that: while I was terrified of being drafted, as was ted, I simply did nothing to lessen my chances of being drafted. Ted, on the other hand, crapped in his pants to appear mentally unbalanced and it fooled the draft board. Oh, he's a big, rough, tough, gun slinging baddy now, but where was he when America needed him? </p>

 <p> To this commenter, it has always been apparent, that the Obama agenda has been to weaken and diminish America.  His entire background and upbringing, has been antiAmerican.  His father was a card carrying communist, and his mother, also.  His mentor, Franklin Marshall Davis, another hater of anything American.  How can one so young and impressionable, not be swayed into a world of Marxism,Communism, and Socialism.?  Why has he sealed all his school,medical, and personal records.?  No other President in history, has been as secretive.  Please, Mr.President, what are you hiding, and why.? </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I'm a strong conservative, but I also insist on basing opinions on facts. 'Bowing to Beijing' (BTB) doesn't even come close to succeeding. It's prize photo is one of President Obama slightly genuflecting to President Hu, displaying appropriate courtesy (given Asian traditions) to a head of state - especially one who has such enormous economic power and holds so much of our government debt. Unfortunately, the authors forgot to balance this with even a brief summary of how Obama had publicly criticized the Chinese while in Beijing - in my opinion, an incredible show of bad manners. (The most recent Pew Poll shows Chinese satisfaction with their government and economy far, far greater than Americans with their own.) Continuing, the authors go on to condemn Obama for hosting a State dinner for Hu because of Mao's atrocities - so we should also hold Reagan, Bush I and II responsible for slavery in America, the slaughter of hundreds of thousands in the Philippines, etc.?Unfortunately, there's more - much, much more. BTB is concerned that China's growing economy is being used to 'arm an increasingly ferocious military,' but fails to mention that China's military expenditures, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of GDP, are far less than ours, that the U.S. creates considerable provocation vs. China (eg. flying spy planes just off its shore-line, sailing the 7th Fleet in the South China Sea, stationing forces in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and now Australia), and that China recognizes it has become increasingly vulnerable to sea-based interruptions of its merchandise exports and energy imports. More embarrassing yet - China has developed and deployed relatively cheap supersonic cruise missiles and ICBMs widely regarded as capable of destroying our aircraft carriers, etc. - applied asymmetric warfare! And who started two major wars in the last decade - it wasn't China!Obama also purportedly commits nationalistic blasphemy by not defending our status as 'God's special people.' That's so silly, it's sad - whatever happened to the Protestant ethic, that 'God helps him who helps himself?' China is expected to pass our GDP by 2016, China has become the world's greatest creditor nations and holds trillions of dollars of our government debt - while we've become the world's greatest debtor nation, our infrastructure has become both inadequate and sometimes dangerous (vs. their thousands of miles of high-speed rail, numerous new cities and airports, building the world's largest dam, undertaking the world's largest smart-transmission network and solar generating capacity, etc.).On technology transfer - China has clearly been implicated in a considerable amount of industrial and defense spying. On the other hand, BTB doesn't mention the enormous technical help provided China willingly by U.S. companies pursuing 'Free Trade' policies that also have cost us millions of formerly high-paying jobs, and continue today especially in high-technology (eg. aircraft bodies, electronics, and engines, semi-conductors, solar energy generation, drug research).As for the role of government, BTB carps about 'current government activism hampering what should be a broad-based economic recovery' - ignoring the fact that government regulatory inaction was the biggest cause of the Great Recession, and China's much stronger government involvement in its economy universally is credited with giving it over 3 decades of 10%+/year GDP growth. (GDP grew at an average 2.5% during Bush II years, despite massive tax cuts, and a housing bubble. We're at 2% now.)On and on - absolutely inane, almost enough to make one a liberal. But even BTB can't do that for me! </p>

<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> An Well Argued Contribution </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> China is on the rise.  This is a well known fact. However how America and the world deal with that rise is of the utmost importance.  In this well argued polemic the authors argue that "under Obama's presidency America is indisputably in decline-and Obama seems to welcome this outcome."  The book doesn't pull any punches, declaring "this book will investigate the evil of the Maoist regime in Beijing and expose how Barack Obama has accelerated American decline and hastened Chinese global ascendency."In Bowing to Beijing, Mr. Decker, of the Washington Times, and Triplett examine how China has fooled the world into believing that it is both progressive and a state with wealth equality and has become more modern.  At the same time China, with the largest army in the world, has been throwing its weight around.  "China has been moving south at least since January 1974, when it kicked the South Vietnamese off the Paracel Islands.  Most importantly the China is accused of spying on the U.S and undermining the American economy.  In one pertinent example, it turns out the eco-friendly company Solyndra which has been in the news of late.  It was "undermined by cheap Chinese competition and a dubious business model."  China has also been dabbling in political lobbying in the U.S.  The book argues that the Chinese have purchased access in Washington, sometimes to the tune of $22,000 a month for an individual.  Henry Kissinger, the famous former U.S Secretary of State, is also accused of being in the pocket of China, especially in light of a 1989 oped in which he defended China's decision to suppress pro-democracy demonstrators.  Finally, however, there is hope.  "The real bulwark to this juggernaut is traditional America and the remnants of Western Civilization, which espouse freedom over tyranny."This is an interesting book, but it is merely one of many that have detailed the dangerous rise of China and it does not necessarily go beyond what others have argued.  The style of presentation, with large quotes from the book presented on the pages as in a newspaper make the reader feel that the information is being slightly dumbed down.  These downsides are mitigated by a helpful series of appendices that detail selected cases of Chinese espionage.Seth J. Frantzman </p>
