 <p> Yet another great book, from a great writer. One last book in the series and I'm sure I'm going to wish there were more books in the series. But will have to start the next series from her...it also looks like a good one. </p>

 <p> Fire Pearl, book 5 in Cyndi's Beyond Ontariese series is the story of Aria (a jumanna/fire pearl) and Lord Drakkin (a mystic).  Lord Drakkin promised Vee (another mystic he mentored) that he would find and protect his daughter Aria (received a free copy in exchange for an honest review but would gladly have purchased book).  He search leads him to Las Vegas and he teleports her to the desert of San Adrin where he can awaken her mystic abilities.  He does this during sex but accidently bonds with Aria (making her his life mate).  Fire Pearl has some plot twists and the chemistry between Aria & Drakkin is electrifying making it a definite must read!!! </p>

 <p> Too short!  My only complaint is that each of the lives/stories in this series ends too soon.  The stories are so engrossing I hate for them to end! </p>

 <p> I have read the other  books and enjoyed each one. I really enjoy books that have happy endings that seem realistic. These books, including this one, have a heart stopping romance and action along with it. What I love most about these books are the first chapters of the next book to keep you wishing for more. I highly recommend this book. </p>

 <p> Surprisingly captivating </p>

 <p> This book captured my attention from the first page and I could barely put my Kindle down long enough to go to work cause I was worried I would miss something..... I especially liked the cat and mouse game Drakkin and Aria was playing, cause I knew they would get their act together and I wanted </p>
