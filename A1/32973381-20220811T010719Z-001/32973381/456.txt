 <p> This book compiles excerpts of great speakers in other books. Good stuff but it felt rushed and like the cliff notes to a great book on anointing. I did discover some new authors and speakers to look into! Definitely some excellent teaching in here. </p>

 <p> I read a lot of books like this and I did enjoy this one but found it to be a bit confusing. Some thoughts seem to be repeated in different words and there is no real explanation of how to claim anointing. Still, I would probably read something else by this author but would hope for clearer, simpler writing </p>

 <p> Claim Your Anointing is a collection of interviews with people who are using their gifts ministering to people all over the world.The interviews are excerpted from previously published books Shifting Shadows or Supernatural Power and Supernatural Anointing.The book begins by a quote from Randy Clark "be careful of limiting God.  There are different anointings for different seasons of time, for what you care called to do. It is not like there is one anointing."The interviews presented in the book are  "You are so much more than you know" by Julia Loren, "The Price to pay for the anointing" by Randy Clark, "Claiming the anointing of the Holy Spirit" by Bill Johnson, "Claiming the Anointing of a true prophet" by Graham Cooke, "Claiming the anointing for strategic warfare" by Mahesh Chavda, 'Claiming the anointing for miracles of healing" by David Hogan, "Claiming the anointing to reconcile nations" by Myles Weiss, "Claiming the anointing of love to change the world" by Heidi Baker, "Claiming the anointing of power for kissings" by Leif Hetland, "Claiming the anointing to reach your sacred destiny" by John Paul Jackson and Paul Keith Davis.Julia Loren says "As you read about the various gifts, callings and anointings, listen to the voice of the Holy Spirit whispering, "This is you! This is you!".  Through the interviews you get a glimpse into different anointings, and the interviews are supposed to help you discover how you may use your talents and abilities in service to others and thus life your life abundantly, meaningfully and joyfully."The anointing is God's love saturating your life and overflowing to others. If you want more of the anointing, you are, in reality, asking for more of God's love.  Love releases the gifts in greater measure than you ever dreamed could happen through you.  ... The supernatural charisma gifts, or graces, from the Holy Spirit are simply tools, which are always given by God to serve others.The gifts are yours to express but given by God alone and to God alone, belongs the glory.  They are born out of God's love for you and are released out of love for God.""Do you want to know who the happiest people are?  Not the rich, nor the most gifted.  The happiest people are those who find their purpose in life and release their gifts in such a way that they discover they are living a meaningful existence.  The happiest people on earth are those who are living in the flow of grace - releasing God's favor and gifts to others. ... Claiming your anointing will not make you happy.  Releasing the anointing will ... if it is done to the glory of God and not to your own desire for glory." </p>

 <p> It's great that it has subjects pertaining to the anointing by different ministers associated with the anointing and it's use. Very enlightening what each has to say! Not real in-depth, but many nuggets of truth learned through experience. Very good book! </p>

 <p> Priceless! </p>
