<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Didn't work for me at all </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I should have listened to the other poor reviews. I really wanted this to work better than the Mohu Leaf that I recently purchased. I figured since the Mohu was working so well this would be even better. It was not. I received the Lava and put it together and just placed it next to the Mohu and swaped the cable. I went from 18 channels to 4. I figured maybe that wad because the Lava was inside and next to the Mohu, so I placed the Lava on a 10 mast on the roof. I still received less channels than the Mohu gave me and the Mohu was inside attached to a window,  this was a waste of money and time. I returned it and hooked the a Mohu Leaf back up. </p>

 <p> I was in high hopes of this antenna receiving many more channels as the ads promise.  I received 8 less channels.I am returning it and paying $8 for postage.  The sellers are LIERS.  They know that this antenna is no good but they say it will receive channels many miles away.  I reinstalled my old antenna and got my channels back.  I wish I could find a good antenna that will pick up signals 100 miles away, [preferable without a rotating system.] </p>

 <p> I started with the Mohu Leaf Ultimate, but got tired of the picture dropping out when someone walked across the room. The LAVA Omnipro gets a great signal, and is pretty solid. It paid for itself in the first three weeks. Everything else is just money in the bank. </p>

 <p> exactly what you're looking for </p>

 <p> Awesome product.  I get all my local channels and then some.  Some people talk about getting tons of channels... it's true but 90% are stupid religious and Mexican channels I'll never watch.  Something I already knew but for NBC, CBS, Fox, BBC, CW.. all the big guys... crystal clear digital signal as advertised.  BTW I installed this in the back yard using the pole that the DirecTV dish was on... now I get all my local channels, download everything off the net and save a ton of money.  I would purchase again for sure. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Good but not the best antenna available in its price range. </p>

 <p> I purchased this item and evaluated it against one other Omni-directional HDTV antenna in the same price range.  Comparison of the two under the same fringe-area conditions revealed the other antenna exceeded the LAVA OmniPro HD-8008 in that it received 59 clear stations compared to the OmniPro, which received 43 clear stations. The OmniPro was able to receive three VHF signals but all three had poor-fair reception. I do think the OmniPro antenna would be suitable for good reception at short, under 30 mile ranges, but not at over 40-miles ranges. The other antenna had satisfactory/clear HD UHF reception out to about 45 miles. I do admit the test was conducted under less than scientific conditions, but the results convinced me not to keep the OmniPro antenna, which I returned.. </p>

 <p> Antenna works great when Installed outside.  Tried it inside and it worked, but when I put it on the roof, I received just about every channel available in my area.  Some channels where a little skippy, but thats because they signal for those channels are so far out.  Recommend getting a third party amplifier as the included one is pretty basic. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Using with Tivo Roamio </p>

 <p> Getting great HD channels for free to my Tivo Roamio.  All the major networks come in with no issues.  And it's just sitting outside.  Not mounted on the roof or anything.  Would recommend. </p>

 <p> The add says Omni Directional, I found it Semi-Omni Directional, reason, when I had it facing south I was only picking up a weak signal from my northern broadcasters 79.5 miles away (6 total) but when I turned the antenna north I started receiving strong signal from those same broadcasters as well as still receiving strong signals from my southern broadcasters 55 miles away (7 total). Also I still receive one broadcast in analog from over a 100 miles to the northwest. I have used Lava antennas for about 5 years now (the HD-2805 and the HD-2805 ultra both still in use elsewhere) and I recommend all of them, for the price and the reception you want beat them, $60 to $80 one time price verse $29 to whatever monthly from cable or dish, you do the math. Some will say you are limited to just a few channels, (CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX, PBS) well they are free what else could you ask for. </p>

 <p> love it.... No longer doing the $$$$$$$$ dance with local cable company..... I have 7 HD tvs running off it and they all come in great!!!! At first i had a few problems due to cable line being split  to many times and crap wire.... I also have some long runs with a few spliters on them and I still get just as many channels and they look great...... The other problem I had.... it wasnt high enough now i have it on a 10 pole on top of the roof and all is great.... If I find a way to add picture i will????? we had a snow storm the other... I had zero problems with it..... high winds snow and ice.......the reason for the 4 stars is when i tighten cable wire to it I tighten it to tight and something broke..... so get it tight but dont go for real tight...... </p>

 <p> this is a great little antenna , although it is really not Omni directional, channel strength does change dramatically when you move the antenna, I could not give it 5 stars cause I cannot use a signal amp. for it every time I added one, ( tried a few different)  the signal loss was greater. not sure why but it was. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> No reception </p>

 <p> I bought this antenna based on a recommendation but have not been able to receive a single channel. To be fair, I don't have it mounted outdoors on a mast.  I only tried it indoors at table level and up in my attic.  I didn't expect reception to be great indoors but no signal at all?  One of the reasons I selected this antenna versus an indoor antenna is supposedly greater coverage radius. </p>

 <p> Did not work. </p>

 <p> After proper installation and scanning antenna received a total of two channels. Customer service was quick to make excuses. Reinstalled old ugly antenna and will be returning this. </p>
