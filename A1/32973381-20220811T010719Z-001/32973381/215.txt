 <p> This is a reasonably decent HBO movie with Kris Kristofferson and Treat Williams working for the Border Patrol. When they find a buried jeep with a sniper rifle and money they start to investigate where it came from. The next thing they know there are government agents in town that want to kill them. They must figure a way to get to the bottom of where the money came from and get out of the country without getting killed. This seems like a TV movie but the production is good enough it is certainly worth at least a rental and for a reasonable price perhaps purchasing. </p>

 <p> Great film-would normally give it 5 stars. But as others have NOTED it has been cut. Thus I'm at a loss reading reviews from folks who claimed to have seen it in the theaters(I did) and give it high marks-The most important single line in the movie- the line that makes the movie AND THE ENDING--when Rip Thorn points to the rifle and says that is the gun that did it (aka shot Kennedy) IS MISSING. I can only assume they lost the Master Negative and just used an existing print for the DVD and that print had damage at some point and was missing the line....Totally incredible-the one line that makes the movie, makes the ending and it is missing. Like an idiot I threw away my VHS copy before watching the DVD.. </p>

 <p> Kris Kristofferson ("Logan") and Treat Williams ("Ernie") are U.S. Border Patrol agents in Texas, about to lose their jobs to siesmic sensors. While driving in the desert (Kings Anvil Ranch, near Tucson, Arizona), Kris discovers an old, buried jeep and a case filled with $800,000. Then, he departs to inform his partner, Ernie.They return to the site and uncover a skeleton plus a wallet with a Texas drivers license for Michael Curtis of San Antonio, Texas. Kris is disgusted with the corrupt Border Patrol and wants to take the money and run. But, Treat thinks it is wrong to do such. Kris the Rebel versus Ernie, Mister Goodie Two-shoes. Up until this point the script is decent. However, logic is then replaced by nonsense.Suddenly, secret agents arrive from Washington, D.C. and a grand John Kennedy assassination conspiracy engulfs Kris and Treat. I could write paragraphs about all the nonsense that happens, all without explanation or motivation. First and foremost, this film is far removed from Oliver Stone's JFK. Secondly, the subplot love story is hokey to say the least. Third, a team of assassins from Washinton, D.C. working for some unknown agency, is far from suspenseful unless you are a conspiracy freak. Fourth, I seriously doubt the JFK assassin was driving with the assassination rifle and $800,000 in cash, at night, in the rain, in a remote area of Texas near the Mexican border. But, if you believe such nonsense, then you will like this film.The soundtrack is not noteworthy even though by Tangerine Dream. And, the desert scenes are nice but not spectacular.I think the DVD version has been edited but I do not have the willpower to simultaneously watch the VHS and Special Edition DVD versions. If you are a Kris K. fan then you will like this film. It is standard Kris, the rebel. Anyone who thinks this is a five-star film has been sitting in the sun too long or smoking too much weed. I am not sure it even warrants three stars. Two and one-half stars is probably an honest rating. I cannot imagine watching this movie twice.This film was produced by Silver Screen Partners Limited for HBO. The copyright date is 1984. Initially, it was released on videocassette by Thorn-EMI, which is long gone. After watching, you'll wish this film had disappeared with Thorn-EMI. </p>

 <p> I saw this movie when it was first released on video and I liked it well enough but figured I never needed to see it again. The title re-surfaced as I was researching some other movies and it received some very good user reviews. I figured maybe I should give it another shot and I'm glad I did. This was considerably better than I'd remembered.Treat and Kris play border patrol officers who stumble across a jeep that must have been buried in the ground during a storm. Said jeep contains a corpse, a gun and a steel tool box containing $800,000 in clean bills. While trying to figure out how to deal with the situation, federal agents arrive and the story of the jeep begins to unfold in bloody fashion.This appears to be the director's, William Tannen, first feature film and he does a better than decent job. He pays close attention to the terrain so the viewer gets a good feel for time and place. As much as I like Treat Williams, he isn't the greatest actor around but he holds his own here. Kris Kristofferson has a very natural presence on the screen so his character comes across very well. Kurtwood Smith though really lights up the screen as the head federale'. He has much the same slimy appeal as he had in Robocop.There were some things in the story which just didn't make sense as I was watching, but a nice twist at the end squared that away and put my reservations to rest. They also had some nice details as to how good Treat and Kris were as trackers. It gave the proceedings a very realistic touch. The writer did his homework in that regard.This is a very good film. No great art perhaps but very good craft. It was well worth going back to for me and certainly worth the time I invested in it. </p>

 <p> The movie was a B movie produced in the 1980s.  It has a good cast (Kris Kristofferson, Treat Williams, Rip Torn, etc.) but the story is 'so-so.'  Without giving away the full plot, the investigation of the two border patrolmen portrayed by Kristofferson and Williams leads to a tie-in with the Kennedy assassination (JFK).  However, the viewer will find himself, as I did, ahead of the two police officers in figuring out where the mystery they are investigating actually will lead.  So, what could have been a more effective build-up to this conclusion failed because of a mediocre script.Still, the movie is entertaining as far as it goes but don't expect the tightness of plot as presented in other films of this genre such as Warren Beatty's 'The Parallax View.' </p>

 <p> I was the Location Manager on this picture and it was a tough one to make. The entire movie was made in and around Tucson, Arizona. We shot it in the summer with temperatures ranging upward to 110. We were 20 days in a huge wash where we buried the jeep. The top layer of the soil was like powder and even a footstep caused it to swirl. But, I had a great time on this film. The wash is located on the Kings Anvil Ranch. I told John King I needed a strip to land a plane so he got in his bulldozer and graded a 1500' landing strip for us. All the scenes shot in the city were easily done with 100% cooperation from the officials. You will most certainly enjoy this action picture with a real shocker at the end.Jack Young </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> "Flashpoint" is one of those films that pay cable channels put into heavy rotation after its initial release back in the 1980s and one that still occasionally turns up nowadays as one of those middle of the night flicks on TBS or TNT. I first saw it eons ago, and never forgot its conspiratorial tone and desert atmosphere. When I first started getting into DVD in a big way, I looked for this movie right from the start only to discover it had not yet crossed that oftentimes impassable gulf between digital video disc and VHS tape. It is the type of film I knew--through long and painful experience with big studios and their total disrespect for DVD technology--would only appear on a disc in a fullscreen format with little to no extras, and I was right. It is that obscure. Hopefully its recent reemergence will help this film find a whole new generation of fans. "Flashpoint" is a must watch film for anyone who enjoys the idea of seeing Kris Kristofferson, Treat Williams, Rip Torn, Kurtwood Smith, Jean Smart, and Miguel Ferrer in the same movie. O.k., a few of those names might not be a selling point, but it's still an intriguing film nonetheless.The American Southwest is an environment of sand, cactus, heat, and more heat. It's the sort of place where some people still think they live in the Old West, the sort of place where people keep to themselves. It's also a place where secrets can hide under the sand for decades without anyone the wiser. Such is the case in "Flashpoint," a film where a dirty secret from some twenty odd years earlier is about to cause a whole lot of grief for a whole lot of people. Enter Logan (Kristofferson) and Ernie (Williams), two border patrol officers who spend their days roaming through the desert chasing illegal aliens. These two men couldn't be further apart in temperament and manner. Logan is a jaded Vietnam veteran and a once promising government employee who now thinks his job is a real drag. He's just putting in his time and trying not to make waves because he wants people to leave him alone. Ernie, however, is an idealistic younger guy who doesn't hesitate to stand up to injustice when he sees it. For example, an auto accident in town that claims the lives of several illegal aliens finds Ernie confronting the man responsible for smuggling people over the border. The two get along so well because they admire each other's personalities.Both men also form a bond over the latest shenanigans going on at the border patrol office. The bigwigs in Washington decide it's a great idea to bury thousands of computer-controlled sensors out in the desert to track the movements of the illegals, an idea that will cost agents their jobs. While burying one of these sensors, Logan discovers a jeep buried out in the desert. The skeletal remains of the driver, a driver's license, a box filled with fishing gear and a rifle, and nearly a million dollars in cash form the beginnings of a mystery that will bring about a mess of trouble. The driver's license is dated 1963. So is the money. And the story takes place in Texas. Do you see where this is going yet? Yep, Logan discovered someone involved with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The two officers don't know this at first, but soon will after Ernie insists on discovering this man's identity before he will agree to split town with the loot. Logan grudgingly obliges. Their investigation agitates Sheriff Wells (Rip Torn) and brings in the enigmatic federal agent Carson (Kurtwood Smith) and his goons. Ernie and Logan soon discover that they are facing something far bigger and more powerful than they are, something that won't hesitate to kill anyone in its path to keep the cover up in place. Lots of innocent people bite the dust by the time the credits roll."Flashpoint" is a great film, one of those great films largely ignored by both critics and the viewing public. Surprisingly, it's not the connection to the JFK assassination that makes the film as good as it is, although the scenes in which the two men begin to unravel the connection between the jeep and the crime are truly eerie. The film also never really explains the parameters of the conspiracy Ernie and Logan are up against except to hint that it's something large and powerful beyond belief, powerful to the point that it can kill law officers with ease and without any fear of interference. What does make the film a winner, aside from the wonderful performances of the principal actors, has a lot to do with the atmospheric desert environment. It is frightening to consider what secrets lie under the sand out in the middle of nowhere, and even more frightening to think the government knows what's hidden out there. That a cabal of powerful individuals could sweep into the desert and do whatever they want to anyone they want is an extremely horrific proposition, and one that works wonders in this movie. After all, it's awfully difficult to find witnesses out in the middle of the desert."Flashpoint" also boasts a great score from Tangerine Dream that perfectly meshes with the sweeping vistas and mountain backdrops. Sadly, the fullscreen transfer doesn't look too great, and the absence of extras really bothers me. I'm not one of these viewers who must listen to every commentary track or watch every little extra on a disc, but I sure would have appreciated seeing such things on a "Flashpoint" DVD. I'll endorse this Warner disc anyway since the movie is such a great way to spend a couple of hours. I'd like to see a special edition, though. </p>

 <p> Recently I have been seeing a bunch of Kristofferson stuff, starting with Heavens Gate, which everybody agrees was a dud, but which I came to like, somewhere in the second time through....Apparently he was supposed to be the next new great western star, and they put him in a bunch of stuff...Ok,,ok, maybe he put himself in a bunch of stuff. Tracker was awful, Lone Star was a great gem, and Flashpoint is somewhere in between...But go just for entertainment, because if you want logic, or history, a good-old buddy lawman type deal, you will go hungry, unless you brought in popcorn and drinks.The story is about how you can find stuff out West, like in No Country, which has a good chance of getting you killed, unless you be smarter than the dummies that find it in these stories..Could we please get somebody to write a script wherein the hero finds some wealth, and arranges it so that strange dudes don't come into town the next day trying to kill him (maybe even her.)  Closing shots of the hero on the Riviera, like Cary Grant, or in his cabin up near Whistler. Angelina Jolie in Flashjoint, or something like that.He was great in Payback, and also makes a fine Vampire buddy....Lone Star is on my view once a week list....... </p>

 <p> I have waited years for this release to be laser scribed onto DVD--it is here! A very good movie.I have to say the Inspector Carson (belonging to an unknown federal agency), character played by Kurtwood Smith is good if not great acting.He epitomizes the sort of corrupt fellow we all love to hate.His lines in the movie (particularly when he and Border Patrol Agent Bobby Logan, Kris Kristofferson) discuss 'politics' during a stakeout are sheer unadulterated cynicism at the nuttiest best. The conspiracy flakes have probably adopted these lines as their mantra....Great bit part acting by Rip Torn, Roberts Blossom (as the desert rat), Tess Harper and the young and sultry Jean Smart.Kris Kristofferson does a great job with his lines and acting capacity and Treat Williams does ok as well.Anyone who has been in law enforcement--or any other supervisory capacity for that matter--has seen the idiocy and vacuum headedness of the supervisor depicted in the movie of the Border Patrol: Totally inept.The soundtrack by Tangerine Dream is one of my all time favorites because it fits the movie seamlessly and draws you into the scenes. A must see movie. </p>

 <p> Fans of Oliver Stone's JFK conspiracy theory may find FLASHPOINT an interesting variation.  Kris Kristofferson and Treat Williams effectively portray two Border Patrol officers who stumble upon a buried jeep and corpse in the desert.  The jeep also has eight hundred thousand dollars in it and a sniper's rifle.  It's not long before our heroes find themselves battling other agents who don't want this story to get out.  It's ending is surprising, if vague, but you will know where the storyline has taken you.  Tess Harper and Jean Smart are good as the love interests, and Rip Torn, Kurtwood Smith and Miguel Ferrer lend fine support.  An interesting and engaging film. </p>

I was lucky to find another VHS copy. why do they do that?. </p>
