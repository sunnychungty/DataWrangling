 <p> I recommend this dvd set.  I like The Curse of the Living Corpse it is low budget but is still good to watch!  Some creepy moments and actually gives some scares.  One of Roy Schneider's first films. Horror of Party Beach is another story, schlock! But if you like Z rated movies this is for you! </p>

 <p> Yes, at long last, Del Tenney's classic drive-in double feature is here! I first saw these over 30 years ago on late night horror television. Now, they are on DVD in beautiful uncut versions! HORROR OF PARTY BEACH concerns nuclear waste turning underwater corpses into an army of google-eyed bloodsuckers! Watch as they kill unsuspecting 30 year old teenagers! Witness the world's first beach-party w/ hodads vs. bikers in an acrobatic battle complete w/ tumbling men and groovy music (including the hideously catchy "ZOMBIE STOMP")! I love this stuff! CURSE OF THE LIVING CORPSE has Roy Scheider in his debut role. Set in 1892 New England, COTLC is about a zillionaire who leaves his family his fortune, only if they follow strict conditions. Of course, they all fail miserably and wind up croaking one by one! This isn't a bad little chiller considering it's age and lack of budget. The lovely, enigmatic, Candace Hilligoss appears in this, her only other movie besides CARNIVAL OF SOULS. Grab this double bill quick, before it sinks back into oblivion!... </p>

 <p> This review is mainly for "Horror Of Party Beach" which, I thought, was very entertaining while the other half of this twin-bill was nothing to write home about......or write, period.At the beginning of "Party Beach," you'd think you were watching one of those "beach party" musicals as The Del Aires - a so-so group of the day - provide us with some rock music of the time period. Hey, we even got a folk song later by a couple of girls. It wasn't exactly Joan Baez and company, but they weren't bad.Alice Lyon as "Elaine Gavin" may be one of the all-time worst actresses I've even seen on film. It is no shock this is her only movie. Some of the other actors ranged from bad to decent.However, it's the "monsters" - the guys with the "Creature From the Black Lagoon" suits but with better eyeballs and hot dog-like appendages hanging from their cheeks - that mainly make this horrible film a hoot, making not really horrible but good because it was fun to watch.To its credit, it was fairly fast-moving, too, with enough action to keep one's interest. The "creatures" were an active bunch! It all makes for decent viewing if you are a fan of the 1950s schlock monster and/or sci-fi films. </p>

 <p> Okay, these are cheesy movies and that's the point, just for a couple of laughs. What is outstanding is the video quality. You won't find better ones that I am aware of. No, we're not talking stellar high definition merely decent clean copies.  There are copies of the Horror of Party Beach being sold that are so poor, so muddy that it is impossible to see what's going on. Come to think of it, that could be a plus for many viewers. Have some friends over and torture them with these turkeys, it's what a good host does. </p>

 <p> This review is for The Horror of Party Beach / The Curse of the Living Corpse (Del Tenney Double Feature)released by Dark Sky Films.Pros:Run times of both movies match those on IMDB so no editing/cutting.Transfers to DVD are pretty clean and crisp and audio not too shabby.Includes english subtitles so big tick!Price not too expensive.Cons:Original aspect ratios (IMDB) are 1.66:1 whereas both movies are presented in 1.78:1. I get the feeling these have been diddled with to make them wider by cropping the top and bottom a little.  Also the opening credits in The Horror of Party Beach have black borders on all four sides but the side borders disappear once the movie begins proper which is why I suspect that cropping the tops and bottoms may have been too noticeable on the credits.  The movie is still quite watchable so have only deducted 1 star.I give the release 4 stars. </p>

 <p> Although he worked in and on numerous films, Del Tenney is best known for four schlock horror films he made in the early 1960s: Violent Midnight, I Eat Your Skin, The Horror of Party Beach, and The Curse of the Living Corpse.  The latter two were filmed back to back and released together.  As such, most fans of bad horror movies tend to think of them as a unit.The Horror of Party Beach is an unspeakably ridiculous movie, with babes and boys in very tight attire squirming to such awful songs as "The Zombie Stomp" at a beach party.  There's a brief interruption by a motorcycle gang, but that's nothing in comparison with the radioactive, bloodsucking sea monsters that pick this particular moment to make their presence known.  The monsters are remarkably ludicrous.  They resemble upright iguanas with giraffe necks, and they have goggle eyes and mouths that appear to be full of hot dogs.  Pretty soon they're all over the place, killing teenage girls at a slumber party, picking off three New York chippies who get lost in the woods, and snapping up a couple of drunks.  Fortunately, an anxious black maid named Eulabelle (who believes the whole thing is voodoo) accidentally discovers a way to kill the creatures, sending our hero, heroine, and her father into a wild scramble to lay hands on ... sodium.  Sodium?  Yes, sodium.The Curse of the Living Corpse is a somewhat different matter.  The movie begins as a solid "B," with a Poe-ish story about a man who so fears being buried alive that his will requires his family to live for a year in such a way as to anticipate his return.  Quite naturally, murder soon follows, and the cast is remarkably good.  Believe it or not, the film was Roy Scheider's screen debut, and Candance Hilligloss (best known to cult movie fans for Carnival of Souls) makes an appearance as well.  Even though it has a couple of lapses of internal logic, the film even has a good pace--until about midway through, when Tenney makes the mistake of introducing some comic elements that aren't.  The Curse of the Living Corpse never really recovers, although it remains watchable nonetheless.The Horror of Party Beach really is everything people mean when they say they want to watch a really "good" bad movie.  The Curse of the Living Corpse--not so much.  Given that they were probably never much to begin with, the film elements aren't bad.  There are some complaints that the films have been cropped to provide the illusion of widescreen, we're not talking about cropping the Mona Lisa, and I don't think it hurts either film to any real degree.  Whatever the case, if you're a fan of really good bad movies, you'll love The Horror of Party Beach, and The Curse of the Living Corpse at least mildly entertaining.  Recommended to fans of the genre.GFT, Amazon ReviewerIn Memory of Nicky, feline companion of a decade, gone before his time. </p>

They are more lose in this film. Unlike Universal Monsters films. Remember seeing this classic on tv years back. Great late night watch. Curse of the living corpse is also good. </p>

 <p> It's a shame that "Horror of Party Beach" and "Curse of the Living Corpse" were shown together as a double feature at drive-in theatres in 1963.  I wish Dark Skys hadn't put them on the same DVD.  "Horror of Party Beach" is definitely a campy, silly, unrealistic B-movie from an era when beach movies were popular.  However, it does have a very high body count and some gruesome killings.  If only the creatures looked more realistic.  Are those bananas sticking out of their mouths?According to director Del Tenney, the critics praised "Curse of the Living Corpse" but hated "Horror of Party Beach."  I'm not surprised."Curse of the Living Corpse" is the reason why I bought the DVD and it shouldn't have to share the DVD with anything else.  It stands alone as a great Gothic horror classic:  a late 1800s setting; a large, old home with secret passageways; a mausoleum; a bog with quicksand; and a masked killer murdering greedy relatives one by one.  You can't ask for anything better than this.  There are imaginative death sequences and some tension.  Like many Italian gialli, the killer's identity isn't shown until the end of the movie.  As a child, I saw only the ending of the movie on television but never could get it out of my mind.  At long last, I was able to watch it in its entirety."Curse of the Living Corpse" is almost on a par with a Hammer production but the settings and costumes are not quite as lavish.  This DVD is definitely worth the money for anyone who likes old, gothic horror.  Just consider "Horror of Party Beach" a special bonus or ignore it entirely.  There are commentary, subtitles, and theatrical trailers for "Curse of the Living Corpse." </p>

 <p> This double feature showcases two low budget horror films from 1963, shot in crisp black and white. "The Curse of the Living Corpse," the only other film that "Carnival of Souls" star Candace Hilligoss ever appeared in, features a few chilling moments but rates as standard horror in the style of stories by Edgar Allan Poe. It also features Roy S c h e I d e r in his first starring role. But the rollicker winner in this double feature is "The Horror of Party Beach," and can best be described as the beach party genre meets the monsters-created-by-radiation genre, once mentioned by Stephen King as one of his favorite horror films. It rocks, it rolls and there is camp value galore as this tale unfolds at a brisk pace. I would recommend both films for fans of the low-budget horror film. </p>

 <p> I love this set! "The Horror Of Party Beach" was one that I loved as a boy and even if it hasn't improved with age, it's still great fun and "Dig That Monster Suit Baby"!"The Curse Of The Living Corpse" is one that hold a very special place with me as it was one of the first movies that caught me up in the plot so much that I wouldn't leave from in front of the T.V. til a commercial came on. One of the first "slasher" movies, it still holds up well and will have you guessing right up to the slam-bang ending.All in all a great deal and two very fun movies. </p>

 <p> I intended to purchase these movies seperately, but if they were offered in a combo, then even better! In the special features there is a photo of a marquee over a cinema complex. These movies actually did show together as a double feature. I will review each movie seperately.....Horror at Beach Party is a great old monster flick. A beach party is put to a halt after a girl is killed by a radioactive monster. Man that beach party was rockin' too. Check out some of those dancers, like the dude dancing in his Euro-underwear, what a fairy. Biker gang leaders danced back then too. And the band was awesome, on rhythm guitar looked like Buddy Holly's little brother. And the lead singer rocked, it's amazing how loud his voice was with no microphone. Come to think of it I didn't see any guitar amps either. Oh well. The monsters came about from a barrel of toxic waste that was dumped overboard and opened on top of a shipwreck. The monsters look a little like the Creature from the Black Lagoon, but with Cookie Monster eyes and these ginat hotdogs shoved in their mouths.They need human blood to survive, but it seems they prefer female blood. That is why the attack all girl slumber parties, and New York girls on a road trip. But never fear, a scientist figures out how to kill them. He ignores the advice of his Aunt Jemimah housekeeper ("It's voodoo, dat's wut it is") and discovers that th emonsters can be killed by sodium. So the climax of the movie is sodium being thrown at mutants and watching them explode. Now I know that if you touch pure sodium it burns, so they must have made grenades or something.Curse of the Living Corpse is a great flick. This is your daddy's slasher flick. A rich dude named Rufus dies and demands certain criteria for his funeral and burial. He was terrified of being alive, so he left instructions that his vault be left unlocked, the torches are always lit, etc. Of course his family ignores all this because they are in a hurry to have the will read. The will says that if his instructions are not followed, he will return and each of them will die in the way they fear most (drowning, fire, etc.) So of course a mysterious figure goes around killing people. There are some greta kills here, like the severed head breakfast platter. The nude drowning scene in the bathtub was probably watched very very closely by the sensors a couple of times. This is as close to a nude scene as you can get without it being a nude scene.The reason I really wanted this movie was because Candace Holligoss was in it. I loved her in Carnival of Souls, and this is her only other movie. I can't believe such a beautiful woman did not make any more films. She is so hot. If you like her, you got to see her in this flick all decked out in her Victorian duds. She doesn't have a very big part, which was a little disappointing for me, but she makes the most of every bit of screen time. I am so used to her being in almost every frame of Carnival of Souls, that it was strange to see her in a movie that did not revolve around her.So anyway, you get two great old movies on one SINGLE sided DVD. Fire up the player, make the popcorn and have a great Saturday night on the couch with your honey! </p>

 <p> This no-frills disc features two of Del Tenney's more memorable b&w low budget films. The first, "Horror of Party Beach", tells of radioactive spillage off a seaport coast spawning ridiculous looking monsters who proceed to decimate the town's young female population. In one scene, a whole slumber party is slaughtered---(20 girls, count 'em) and the chocolate syrup gets smeared all over. It's supposed to be blood, but that's what it looks like in b&w. Anyway, there's lots of "rock'n roll" by The Del-Aires, lots of silly dancing on the beach by "teens" and that scene stealer Eulabelle Moore (Eulabelle the maid) and her voodoo doll. So inept, so badly acted (except for Eulabelle) and so bad period that it's hilarious. However, Tenney's other feature "Curse of the Living Corpse" is the exact opposite. It's a well acted Gothic horror film that rises above it's low budget and features non-other than Roy Scheider (billed as Roy R. Scheider) in a very early role and Candace Hilligoss ("Carnival of Souls") as members of a family in 1892 New England stalked and murdered by a masked madman who may or not be the deceased patriarch come back from the grave for the family violating his will. One by one, as stipulated in the will, they die by the means they fear most---disfigurement, fire, drowning, suffocation etc. Pretty good stuff. And a surprising bath scene with actress Margot Hartman showing a little more skin than was the norm at the time (1963-64). The print has mild flaws that do not distract and the prints of both films are better than average. There's also an interview and audio commentary with Del Tenney included as extras. Worth owning just for "Curse" alone. Enjoy. </p>

 <p> I had always seen pictures of the monsters from Horror at Party Beach in my Famous Monsters of Filmland Magazines from the 60's, but I had never seen the film in its entirety until watching this impressive DVD release for these two fun low budget, but effective films. First up 'Horror at Party Beach' is well........just what the title suggests! It's got "rock N roll", its got absurd looking monsters and its got swingin' chicks and brawlin' dudes, lovin' and fightin' all in a wild beach setting!What I liked about this film was that despite its low budget, it did deliver what it promised. First off, the monsters look like a combination of Freddy the Frog from New Zoo Revue with a bunch of hot dogs sticking out of their mouths with the body of the Sleestacks from Saturday Morning TV's 'Land Of The Lost' and scales from Sigmund from 'Sigmund And The Sea monsters. Amazingly the monster scenes are handled well with atmospheric and creepy music. It's fairly effective despite the actual appearance of these goofy looking sea monsters.The film is loaded with rock music supplied by a Beach Boys wannabe band, which is hilarious. The print of the film looks very clean and probably never looked this good. Even better there is commentary for both films, trailers, stills gallery and an interview with Del Tenny himself. If only all low budget horror got this treatment!The second film was one I never heard of and although an interesting film for being a really early slasher, I felt it to be a bit stiff and lacking atmosphere. It's a good film, but not the gothic horror film I was thinking it would be. I don't want to spoil the film for anyone who hasn't seen it, but I knew the murders weren't caused by the living corpse all along, so the film suffered because of it. It was interesting to see Roy Scheider(Jaws)in an early role though. Overall this is a great set for fans of such things, but be aware there is a triple feature of Del Tenney films now available with the film Violent Midnight added. I don't know if the extras are carried over from this release, but if they are I may have to upgrade.1) Horror At Party Beach - 4 stars for hokey fun!2) The Curse Of The Living Corpse - 3 stars </p>

 <p> Catering to the owners of the new widescreen televisions, the manufacturers of many DVDs these days are presenting films (like these), which were originally filmed in standard-format, in FAKE "widescreen"--which essentially consists of lopping the tops and bottoms off the original prints (thus leaving many of the actors with half-faces and no feet!)!  It is especially notable on this particular DVD as the CREDITS for both films have been "mini-boxed" in their ORIGINAL format.  The movies themselves are nostalgic, fun-filled SCHLOCK, but I love them anyway.  I would have loved this DVD version of them more, however, if they had been preserved in their original film ratio.  I'm amazed that producer/director Del Tenney allowed this bastardization of his films to occur (he's a participant in the project, offering commentary, etc.) but, then again, the producers of the DVD probably gave him a monetary "offer he couldn't refuse".  It's sad that the owners of widescreen televisions would apparently rather see their bloated screens filled from side-to-side, than enjoy movies as originally filmed--a disturbing trend, indeed, for a film purist like me.  5 stars for FUN, 1 star for presentation = 3 stars. </p>

 <p> This review applies to 'Curse of the Living Corpse' only.I found this B&W; '63 drive-in genre movie rather difficult to assign a star rating because, today, this one is clearly a CULT FILM and peoples' opinions are going to vary widely.Roy Scheider, the only real star in this one, was subsequently type-cast, (especially by "Jaws"), and here, in what was surely a very early career entry, he plays a divergent role as the family drunk and weakling.The story, which takes place in 1898, (I'd guess the location is supposed to be western Europe somewhere, maybe England), is about a rotten and rich old patriarch who suffers from catylepsy and, following the pronouncement of his death by the oldest son who is a very cheesy and unethical doctor, the family hurriedly secures his casket in a masauleum. They quickly want RID of all traces of the old scoundrel as he has tormented each of them unmercifully over the years. Since the aged bugger was always terrified of being buried alive, in his will he had assigned each and every family member, as well as a trusted servant, a little task which would allow him to escape his tomb in case he might not really have died. The family, for the most part, is as rotten as was the old man and they promptly ignore his testamentary directives, much to the consternation of the family lawyer, the controller of the family money, and who hangs around the mansion all the time.Stated in the old man's will was also a direct threat against each family member who failed to carry out his assigned task, (e.g., "Don't lock the masauleum door!"), in addition to their being financially cut out of the will: the daughter fears water, the widow fears fire, the doctor-son fears disfigurement, etc. So, you pretty much KNOW, right off the bat, what's going to happen to these folks.About halfway through the film, a buffoon of a police inspector is called in to investigate the deaths that have transpired so far, and he's assisted by his equally inept constable. These two also hang around the old mansion to make sure that there are no more murders, albeit they are not very successful in this endeavor.About the only bright figures among the family spore are a nephew and his pretty wife, both of whom the old man apparently liked somewhat -- but even these two are still under the testamentary threat just like the rest of the clan. Still, the viewing audience at least has someone to root for, which generates some additional subtle level of suspense.The murder-fare includes a chopped off head, some very nasty quicksand, and various other vehicles of horrific death. We're also treated to the old secret panel in the library and, the eyes peeping from behind the portrait routines. The 'Living Corpse' slinks around wearing a long cape and his face is covered by a black scarf, revealing only his eyes... sort of a Bela Lugosi 'Plan 9' look.The biggest actual problem with this film is that the director chose to make the horror/mystery facet serious, and the police activities as a tongue-in-cheek operation -- in this movie, the two concepts fail to mesh. Beyond that, the cinematography is pretty darn good, and the sets are really tops, all of which helps to save the film. Also, Scheider is pretty convincing in his role which also aids in carrying the film.Finally, this flick really doesn't drag at any point which is an unexpected, but pleasant, surprise. This movie's not as good as an early Roger Corman film (e.g., "Dementia 13"), but it's okay.If you're not into horror/mystery cult films, skip this one. If you're a fan of such productions then you'll probably enjoy it as I did. </p>

 <p> It's been said that films like these don't appeal to anyone but the public, since critics line up to tear them apart, but they do offer fun if you're in the mood. (Horror of Party Beach is by far the more entertaining of the two, this being the elusive uncut version with all the gore intact (an unbearable toned-down version has been making the video and TV station rounds for years).  Both films look and sound as good as they ever have; extras include trailers, photos, audio commentary and interviews. </p>

 <p> Time to honor cult-schlockmeister Mr. Del Tenney with this excellent double feature release. Both drive-in and theatre management made it mandatory that all patrons had to sign a "Fright Release" form that absolved them from all responsibility for any death by fright during the viewing of this dynamic double feature. These contracts were obviously influenced by Producer-Director Mr. William Castle who utilized similar methods to attract movie goers. Well, really, the only Fright Release needed here would be to absolve the management for any death by laughter, as both films are a complete HOWL! "Horror" was made in 1963 and also has been called the very 1st Horror-Monster Musical. Both films were made in Stamford, Connecticut, and I'm not sure why that fine city hasn't erected a statue honoring Tenney for these Psychotronic Masterpieces! The 1st film involves a ship dumping radioactive waste into the sea and, of course, leading to the birth of some vicious monsters. Now this leads the monsters. which are truly beyond description, to climb on to land and attack the teenage girls. We get a gang of kids dancing on the beach to "The Zombie Stomp", as well as some other fine tunes provided by the rock group the Del-Aires. There are many very lame jokes as well as the dialogue, itself, which is totally inane. For example, "Do you like bathing beauties". "I don't know, I've never bathed one". Things get really serious when the monsters attack and murder over 20 teenage girls at a slumber party. Now, a maid named Eulabelle saves the day by accidently spilling some sodium on a monster which then quickly disintegrates. So now the secret as to how to destroy the monsters is revealed. "Horror" was even used by MST3K in one of it's episodes, so you know that it is indeed a classic! The film even included the very real Charter Oak Motorcycle Club of Riverside, Conn. Moving along to the 2nd film, which was also made in Stamford, Conn., in 1963, is actually the very 1st gothic horror film ever made in Stamford. It is actually pretty good, as well. It is a very early gore movie which stars Mr. Roy Scheider in his film debut. In New England in 1892, a family patriarch has passed away and he leaves very strict demands about how he is to be buried. If not followed, he threatens to return from the grave and exact his revenge by making each family member die in the manner by which they each fear the most. Of course, nobody listens to the father and then murders start to occur one by one in the most horrible ways imaginable! The best death is the maid's, as her head is placed on a platter and found on the dinner table. This laughable early gore film is significant as it's cast also includes Candace Hilligoss, who was the star of the cult-masterpiece "Carnival Of Souls", from 1962. This was the only other movie that she played in. Besides a very good remastered print of each film, which are shown in Anamorphic Widescreen, 2.0 Mono, 1.78:1, there are some excellent special features. These include an audio commentary with Del Tenney for each film, a very interesting interview with Del. a nice photo gallery, and theatrical trailers for each film. The running time for "Horror" is 78 minutes, and the running time for "Curse" is 84 minutes, which add up to a grand total of 162 minutes not including the Special Features. Now there's a deal hard to top! "Horror Of Party Beach" has been a long-time favorite of mine ever since I saw it when I was 15. Mr. Del Tenney passed away on February 21, 2013, at his home in Jupiter, Fla., at the age of 82. Now Just Don't Forget to Sign Your Fright Release Certificate before viewing these films! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! SMRZ!! </p>

 <p> Tho i have not watched the whole second feature, 'Horror Of Party Beach' is what i really bought the package for. I was impressed with the trailers and the good quality of the films. I remember watching this particular film on tv on one of those Creature Feature programs that was popular in the 70's.One annoying fact that i despised was the heavy editing that TV  did to this film, which, in my opinion was just a horror film that really couldn't be taken seriously considering how badly acted it was, and that the violence was rather funny in a way.Growing up and not forgetting bad classics such as these, i would time to time see if i could own an un-cut version and just relax and re-live a time when after my parents went to bed i had the joy to be subjected to films such as these. Guilty pleasures are what they are called.I am not down-playing the film, as i tend to take an achievement for what it is, entertainment. This film does entertain, despite it's flaws of bad acting and strange 'Beach Party' music. All i can say is, ENJOY!! </p>
