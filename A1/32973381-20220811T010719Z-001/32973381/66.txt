 <p> It's unbelievable how affordable this sound system was. It sounds like it's a pair or set of speakers.  It comes with one Bluetooth connector that attaches to the 30 pin and of on iPhone, iPad, iPod etc.  Alternatively, you can press a button to search for blue tooth enabled devices and connect to it through the settings on your electronic device.This is great when you have a friend with a non-apple phone or a new iPhone w/ lightning connector, because the adapter can't be used by them. </p>

 <p> Impressive sound from the d5. At the current price of $100 ish, it's a very good buy. Plan on setting this up in living room with  tv for music and television.As my music room is downstairs I wanted to have a simple device in living room for lower level listening and background relaxing. The d5 really fits the bill.Playing lower kbs mp3's even sounds decent.Playing Flac files through my android is better than I expected with good clarity and rich sound. </p>

 <p> The sound quality on this is hard to believe. Its so good. Even when loud. Its very easy to connect! You dont even need the bluetooth adapter as long as ur device has bluetooth. The only downside of this is that its not portable which sucks. But aside from that, great product!!!! </p>

 <p> If you like to get the best bang for your buck, look no further!  Creative ZiiSound D5 wireless speaker system delivers live band sound.  I placed this speaker against the far wall in the living room so I could enjoy it while in livingroom or in kitchen which is on the far side of the livingroom.  Beautiful sound.  I want to listen to music more often because it is so pleasant and enriched sound coming from this small speaker.  The look is elegant.  There is a delay with the bluetooth so I usually connect via cable (included) from my android smartphone to get rid of the annoying delay; but I like having the option of having a bluetooth speaker for my tablet and such which is on the other side of the room.  Just a note of caution, when I installed the creative usb transmitter drivers, I lost my optical drive and hard drive drivers and have not been able to repair yet; the pc was a Gateway that came with Windows Vista on it so it was not that old.  I like that Creative now has a D5x model of this that you can pair with up to three others total and a subwoofer to get left and right channels, etc if your tv has bluetooth capabilities.  I am very pleased with my purchase ofCreative ZiiSound D5 Wireless Multimedia Speaker System for iPod touch 4G, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, Droid, and other Bluetooth-Enabled DevicesI would like to add that the manufacturer's telephone number is nowhere to found in the packaging materials or on the internet.  If you have a problem that requires their response, the only way to interact with them is to leave an email at their waste and wait a couple of days for a response.  Given this, if you have any difficulty with this item within the amazon 30 day return period, it is probably best to return it than hope for Creative Labs to address it. </p>

 <p> I like the versatility of this product. I also like that my iPod can be docked for charging while it's playing music, or playing music while I'm playing games/browsing the web on the iPod.What I don't like about the D5 is that it doesn't have a remote control and there is no way to adjust the bass/treble. If it did, I would give it a 5 stars. </p>

 <p> I was nervous ordering as the price is quite high compared to the d100 I have. The d100 is great for outside and moving around but the sound is not the greatest. My wife wanted something better. Its hard on creative's website to get a good understanding of the drivers in the ziisound series. The sound is very good and the range is great I can place upstairs in the bedroom and I do not have any connection problems. I ordered the Creative GigaWorks T40 Series II 2.0 Multimedia Speaker System with BasXPort Technolgy at the same time. I find the ziisound to have slightly less highs and bass. In comparison to my d100 it is a no contest in all areas. The speaker as a very nice metallic finish to the ends and is quite heavy. The tough volume is very easy to use and can play quite loudy without distortion. I using this on bluetooth and cannot discern much quality loss compared to the Creative GigaWorks T40 Series II. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a small footprint bluetooth enabled speaker. </p>

 <p> I just recently purchased this speaker and I have to say I am very happy with my purchase. I have been looking for many months for an affordable Blue-tooth enabled device where i can pair with my ipad, ipod touch etc. it was very easy to pair with my ipad tablet however i was not able to pair with my ipod touch 4. I am not sure why however i did connect the wire that comes with the device. i love the sound for my small 1 bedroom apartment. It is more that what I expected. I highly recommend it. I was hoping this speaker would also take batteries so i can easily move it around but it does not.  In any event if you are looking for that feature this one does not have it. Overall i give it an outstanding review for sound and nice bass also. It really does fill up a room. and its nice and compact but not tiny. it is about 9 lbs. or so and has a nice sleek look. You will be happy with your purchase and you can use to entertain a small group of people for any gathering in your home. Delivery was fast and i was pleased with the packaging. </p>

 <p> Left channel comes no sound when connect by Aux. Confirm the source and cable with no problem. Contact Creative service, they agree to exchange, but I need to pay shipping charge. Damn it.And there is small spoiled hole on surface fabric. </p>

 <p> I had recently bought a Jambox Bluewave after seeing its compact size and some good reviews, however the unbearable hiss when the unit was on standby irritated me no end.I decided to put money on the D5 Ziisound and have never been happier. The unit gives very good sound quality and doubles as a soundbar for my 32 inch LCD TV (connected by a supplied 3.5mm audio connector). Its not as good as my Morel Home Theatre but that set is almost 10 times the price. BT pairing is easy.Verdict: Affordable speaker with decent quality for a small to medium size room with good BT streaming via a2DP protocol. </p>

 <p> Affordable with excellent sound quality, better than many competitors </p>

 <p> The sound from this speaker is GREAT! I cannot believe what comes out of this somewhat small speaker. The bass is magnificent. The only thing I don't really care for is the power cord used with it. Because I bought this unit for travel purposes, it's a little too big for my tastes.  All-In-All I really like this unit. </p>

 <p> I have several iPod docks. Klipsch, JBL and a Bose. I wanted a wireless Bluetooth unit for iPad and Laptop. Tried the D100 for Creative. Not bad, but very little Base.Set this up in 10 Mi. Sound is Clear and Loud.Using now wile on my MacBook Air. It's over $225 but is more than 2x better than the D100 unit.Was going to try Sonos, but that starts at $300 and up.  For a mid size room this easily fills it with good sound. </p>

 <p> Pricy but Very good sound </p>
