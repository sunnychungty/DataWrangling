 <p> I have found that when you try to press apps or areas around the edge of the screen protector portion sometimes your touch does not register the first time. Other than that I like it. </p>

 <p> Just okay. </p>

 <p> i like the idea of having a case and screen protector all in one but the plastic over the screen isn't very good. When i got it it had a white streak on it kind of when you fold plastic kind of streak. moisture gathers between the screen and the plastic on the case so i have to take the top of every now and then to dry it. I'm thinking of just cutting off the plastic par that goes over the screen maybe that will help. I do like the case makes it alot easier to grab the ipod. </p>

 <p> the plastic cover over the screen is the only thing i don't like </p>

 <p> poor quality. the rubber pieces covering the headphone & charger ports were incredibly weak and TORE the first day. I ended up having to cut them the rest of the way off because they were just dangling there. The whole rubber covering was flimsy and doesn't fit properly. The inner hard shell is a tad bit too small so you have to FORCE it to clasp shut. The speaker is partially covered by the case on the bottom, so you don't get quality sound. Not to say the device has quality sound in the first place... but it's much worse with the case on. Mine also came with what appears to be hardened glue on it. It doesn't stay black. After only a couple days use, it has started wearing out and losing it's coloring. Great attempt at a knock-off of otter box..... but this particular case has a LONG way to go. Completely unsatisfied; & if they would take it back in this condition after only having it for less than  a week, i would gladly let them have it back. Also, wanted to state that i'm an amazon prime member. supposed to be 2 business days and it took an extra TWO days to get here. smh. Not the post office's fault either. </p>

 <p> Once I assembled the Cimo case correctly, it fit my iPod like a glove. However, the &#34;fatal flaw&#34; was apparently the snugness of the case. Once installed, my iPod would not charge. I had to call Apple tech support, set up a Genius Bar appointment at an Apple store, and write to the manufacturer describing this issue. I received a prompt reply telling me that some of the units in their last batch apparently had a similar manufacturing defect. They immediately refunded my entire purchase. I continue to use the unit, but I have to remove it from the case in order to charge it. You may have better results than I experienced. I have mixed feelings about this product. Apple products are designed to perfection. Third party products for Apple hardware cost less than official Apple gear, and most of the time work just as well. Even the Apple technician thought that the Cimo case was well designed. However, I didn't expect that such a simple product would involve so much follow up time. </p>

 <p> A beautifully designed case with a fatal flaw </p>

 <p> The case comes with a hard shell and a wrap around rubber cover. The rubber cover does not sit over the hard case properly. The hard case has to be opened to charge the ipod. The port for chargind slightly covers the lightning connector port. There are some platice rises on the hard shell to protect the buttons but that is the same reason the rubber wont sit properly. The bottom portion comes with three rubber buttons. I dont know why but they cause the rubber cover to seperate from the hard shell. </p>

 <p> Avoid! </p>

 <p> this case fits the new ipod touch 5 snugly and securely in it's plastic shell. the outer rubber skin is thin but feels good to the touch. but the clear plastic faceplate has a minor flaw. it looks like it has thousands of tiny horizontal lines on it. if you view anything white with text you will clearly see them. </p>

 <p> Decent Case Has Minor Flaws </p>

 <p> Easy to install and the outer shell makes it easy to hold and not slip out of your hand also does not slide out of you pocket when you bend over or move around.High recommend to any one who has a new iPod version 5. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> I love it. </p>
