<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> A True Submissive Matched with the Perfect Doom </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>
  06-10-2013  
<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Now this was the story I was looking for... Enraptured was the perfect blending of a Sadist (Roman) and a Submissive (Jessica).Jessica was perfect for Roman, she was the perfect submissive for him and she also filled the lonely gap in his life. What I loved so much about this book was the relationship between these two, it just flowed. I mean it was just perfect. You ever read a story and you just knew just by reading a few pages that the couple was right for one another? Well it happened here in Enraptured....I just knew Jessica would be the one to pull Roman out of his funk.In the 3rd and final book in the Enslaved Trilogy, our story starts with Roman Chase and in my opinion...the one true Dom in this group of BAD boys (Billionaire Arrogant Doms). He was the only arrogant Dom and the only one with TRUE experience because the man actually trained subs. But Roman was tired of that and he wanted something...no needed someone in his life permanently. He needed a true submissive that would fit his sadists feelings...his need to give pain.Jessica was perfect! Just perfect for Roman. She was sweet, funny and she was a true submissive and even though the girl was new to the lifestyle and I do mean vanilla new. She never questioned (I mean she did, but it was never in a disrespectful way) or topped from the bottom AND my most hated thing to read....she was not a BRAT! The girl was perfect for Roman.So as I said Jessica was new to the BDSM world...so lucky she came across a Dom who trained other submissives before. Here Roman was able to take his time and teach Jessica about the BDSM world and slowly train her on what he needed from her as a Sadists. And I know you're probably thinking "omg, she's new and with a Sadists?" Well, I think Shoshanna Evers did a wonderful job leading up to Roman's story by letting us know first hand that he trained subs before...so to me it wasn't like she was just thrown into the lifestyle. She was in good hands with Roman."You changed my life," he said, the smile lighting up his handsome face. "You brought the sunlight in".And this is what I loved most about the story. Jessica was able to give Roman what he needed as a sadist, but she was also able to draw real feelings out of him. He actually wanted Jessica in his life, needed her. And he in turn, was able to fulfill her needs as a submissive.If I had any dislike of this story, it was the constant almost seeming thought that Jessica was after Roman because of his money....especially when Elisabeth & Lauren just put the s*** out there."I think we're worried about Roman," Elisabeth said. "we don't want to see him get his heart broken again""We've both been through it" Elisabeth said. "Suddenly having a Black Amex in your hand, having the world at your fingertips. It's heady stuff. It can make a girl question her own motives.""Uh...ONE, please speak for yourself."Not once while reading this story did I think Jessica was in it for the doe....she actually was attracted to Roman and then eventually fell in love with him, even when he didn't commit (at the time!), she still wanted to stay with him. Me personally, I just think Elisabeth was jealous because she didn't have Roman to pine after her bratty self no more. I just felt like she was so hypercritical, I mean didn't you come to Trevor broke & didn't he pay off your bills? Like really, you have the gall to question someone else's motives? And then pass it off as if you care about Roman?*pats at hair and smooths skirt* as you can see I didn't like Elisabeth and Lauren (I liked her!). But because Jessica wanted to please Roman, she took it all in stride.As I said in my review of Enamored, I hoped that Shoshanna Evers brought her A game with Roman's book and I have to say she did. She gave me exactly want I wanted....a true Dom matched with a perfect submissive.This was truly a good end to this trilogy.Review @ Salacious Reads.[...]*book received through Edelweiss for the purpose of an honest review </p>

 <p> This is exactly what I wanted for Roman.  I love the way Ms. Evers brought this series to a close and everyone got their HEA's.While this book can be read as a stand alone... I HIGHLY recommend that you read all 3 to truly feel ENSLAVED... ENAMORED... and ENRAPTURED. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> A bit of a dissapointment </p>

 <p> I felt that the Roman that you read about in the first book and the Roman you get in this book is different people. I understand that in the story he needs to change but for me there is not enough of him in the beginning to recognise him as the real Dom of the first book. In the first book he was really a scary guy and in this book he is just from the start a normal Dom who would even be told what to do by his friends girl. </p>

 <p> Goodness!  This was one hot series.  The authors always save the most difficult character for the last in their series and it this one blew my mind.  Roman is just that lost soul you want to cuddle and make everything alright even though he can be the biggest jerk and scary at times.  Jessica is young and most would like to believe innocent, but she knows who and what she wants and Roman and his world are both of those things.  As with any relationship there are challenges and these two are no exception (especially when your in love with a sadist).  I had a very large smile on my face at the end of this book.  The ending was all I could have hope for.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this series.  Yes, there is lots of kinky sex and it's hot as hell, but the storyline is just as wonderful as the kink :) </p>

 <p> I'm glad Roman finally found someone.... it was really obvious even in the book before this one that it would be Jessica.... it's a shame they took the mystery out </p>

 <p> Maybe it is just me or maybe it's because I have my own bad boy but I love a story about the tough guy, the strong one, the one who no one think has a heart because we all know that is just a mask.  Roman is scary to some but to me just someone that needs to let that heart open to possibilities.  Yes, it was broken but despite his best efforts not shattered.  The story of Roman and Jessica is not just about the &#34;kink&#34; but the true development of a relationship.  I absolutely loved this story and am so glad there is proof that the bad boy is not always BAD... </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> The "ENSLAVED" serie is a treat, even if sometimes a little disturbing. But I confess I've not expected a slave story for this third installment.I admit that the age of Jessica, her need for money and inexperience in life have made &#8203;&#8203;me cringe when Roman asked her to belong to him.Associated with the age difference between the young woman and Roman, supported by some fair warnings from Elizabeth about the money issue and the submission... And this story has me extremely ill at ease.Even when Roman is described as sincere in his intentions towards Jessica, even if he treated her with respect and that their relationships are consensual, I struggled to enjoy my reading.And yet there are super hot scenes including spanking with Mistress Lauren that have piqued my interest. Idem for the tender moments shared with Roman that make me smile. But, I could not ignore the "but" that was nagging my mind ...Lucienewbooksonmyselves.blogspot.fr </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> We've gotten to know Trevor and know that he's happily married to Elisabeth. We became friends with Marc and know that he and Mistress Lauren are cozily in love. It's time to turn our attention to the baddest of the BAD Boys, Roman.As a Dom, Roman has a reputation for lethal skill. Whereas Trevor and Marc are jovial and friendly, Roman is cold, forbidding, and ruthlessly focused on inflicting pain as a means of pleasure and punishment. He thought he found his dream sub in Elisabeth but had to watch helplessly as she married Trevor. And "helpless" is not something Roman knows or does well.He tries to numb himself with nameless, virtually faceless women, but he knows that any relief is temporary. He needs a sub, and he needs one he enjoys on more than a physical level.Enter Jessica, a twenty-year-old college student who works at the club Roman co-owns with Marc and Trevor. She appears servile enough, and she admits to curiosity. She's also attractive, and Roman feels drawn to her, even as he knows this will not be an easy relationship to undertake. The age difference, for one thing, will cause issues, and then there is the little matter of Roman's heart. Does he have it to give, or does Elisabeth still own it?Getting Jessica to agree to be his sub is the first hurdle. Roman takes Marc's approach and begins with a bet with Mistress Lauren as to whether she can dominate Jessica. But we all know who wants to Dom whom, and it doesn't take long for Jessica and Roman to connect.This one is a bit different from the first two installments in the trilogy in that we get to know a character's family when Jessica's parents come to visit. The real world also factors stronger here, as Roman and Jessica have to confront the challenges that their age gap will bring. But don't worry. The sexy times are very present.I didn't enjoy this one as much as the first two, and I think it's because Roman was such a disappointment. I already was ambivalent about him because he seemed a bit emasculated after the whole Elisabeth thing. I wanted him to come out charging and never stop; the former occurred, but not the latter. He becomes domesticated by Jessica. One of the mandates in his home is that the blinds are always shut, keeping darkness in and light at bay. I realize this is a metaphor for Roman, but he caves in far too quickly to Jessica's request to raise the blinds. I expected him to be stronger, to make her pay for her cheeky request. I know he wants to feel love, but come on. This all happens too quickly, even for him.The sex scenes also seem a bit redundant. I feel like we read very similar scenes in the first two books. Roman's thing is that he really likes inflicting pain, but with Jessica, he doesn't seem as passionate about it. I know she's young and lively and attractive, but it doesn't work. Roman just doesn't work, and I was disappointed by that.If you read the first two, you need to read this one so you can close out the series. Just don't expect it to be as good as its predecessors.Thanks to edelweiss for the previewPublished on cupcake's book cupboard@VivaAmaRisata </p>
