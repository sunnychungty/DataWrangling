 <p> I'm just letting you know that there is a later version of ELVIS 4-MOVIE COLLECTION VOLUME 2 selling for less on Amazon. It's atElvis 4-Movie Collection 2. Somehow these 2 versions have slightly different listings on Amazon, which might prevent people from finding the cheaper one. I did a proper review of this DVD set on the other page. </p>

 <p> All of these films are classic films by the king even though they all have close to the same plot they are all different and all great to watch for any age films from  1959 1963 1967 1966 </p>
