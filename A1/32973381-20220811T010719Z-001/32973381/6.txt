 <p> wonderful upgrade from the s5200 </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Once you add the protective adapter barrel and a nice 55mm UV filter with lens cap, and after you get yourself a nice lens hood, you have yourself a nice looking and feeling camera hereThe pictures I've taken, whether macro, telephoto'd or anywhere along the zoom range line have come out well. Even ISO800 images come out quite well. RAW images that come out of this camera and processed through Fastone(image program) generally look astounding. The larger 1/1.7 sensor definately flexes its muscles in the s7000.However, with the high shutter range, fast 2.8 lens, and general nice feel, I cannot understand why Fuji limited the ISO range. My s5200 can take 64-1600, which is why I still keep it around. If I could think of any other prosumer camera that could one up this dynamic duo, it would be the Konica Minolta A2 with it's manual features, larger sensor, better lens system and generally bulky feature set.Other than that, I believe this camera does the trick for hobby photographers. </p>

 <p> I own two S7000's. My review is simple. I purchased my first S7000 new in 2004. It served me well as my first digital camera. I love the way it takes excellent macro pics. It is hard on batteries and I quickly learned that lithium batteries were the only thing that would last for long. My biggest challenge with this camera is the delay between the time you press the button to capture your image vs. the time the image is actually taken. With the slight delay, I had to work and practice a lot to capture images at the exact time I wanted them. This was especially important to me when shooting pics of my family playing sports. Several snap-on attachments I acquired for the lens seemed to be a waste of time and money. I am especially fond of the fact that you have the option to use a view finder or the small monitor on the back of the camera to frame your shots. With my vision being slightly less than perfect, I enjoy the view finder because it makes the images much sharper than the viewing screen. A simple press of a button lets you switch betweeen these two options.A few years ago I upgraded to a Nikon camera but I continued to use my S7000 for macro shots and locations (sporting arenas) where professional cameras (my Nikon) was not allowed. Approximately three years ago my S7000 suddenly quit working. The view finder/monitor on the camera would not display clear images. Any pics taken also showed the same scrambled image. Attempts to get the camera repaired were met with expensive estimates of around $200. Eventually I found a used S7000 on Amazon at a very reasonable price. Even with the few shortcomings, I am very happy to have another S7000.Note: With regards to the above mentioned purchase, I procrastinated and did not immediately rate the Amazon seller of the S7000 I purchased several months ago. When I tried to rate them recently, I discovered an Amazon policy that would no longer allow me to do so. I would like to thank Amazon seller BFuller563 for the entire buying experience of my second S7000. The purchase was handled perfectly, the seller communicated with me in an extraordinary manner, and I highly recommend BFuller563 to others. </p>

 <p> The fact that this Fuji Finepix S7000 came out nearly four years ago and is still so highly regarded give one an idea of its good qualities. It is ergonomic - the fingers and thumb find the zoom, AE lock, flash, exposure compensation, viewfinder/LCD toggle without much struggle. The viewfinder is excellent - detailed and has as much info as you could want.It eats up standard AA batteries, so get some NiCads, NiMetalhydride, or some other type of rechargeable.But they are a good point - available everywhere. I have read that the early models produced have had the problem of the CF card running down the four AA batteries when the CF card is left in the camera between shoots. So, it is a good practice to remove the CF card after using it (it is menu selected as to using the CF or the Fuji xD card). Otherwise you will pick up the camera one day with the CF card in it and find the batteries drained.Later production may not have this problem. The camera was designed to use the IBM mini disk card, not the standard CF card. But it does, with reservations. For example, I could  not get video do upload to Picassa from the CF card. Photos uploaded OK.I have been astounded at the quality of the images shot at the highest resolution, written to the CF or xD card as 12 megapixel images. The lens, even racked out to maximum telephoto is tack sharp and contrasty. I've used many cameras in my life and this is a favorite. For the amount of money you can get one of these new or used, you can't go wrong. It is a winner.It also does 30 fps VGA video with the highest quality I've seen so far. Also, although it doesn't seem to have an image stabilization system, I have been amazed how little the images deteriorate due to low shutter speeds or normal camera shake. Maybe it uses a 'stealth' stabilization! Anyhow, I love it and have rediscovered the joy of photography through finding how much I could do with this beauty.Recommended. </p>

 <p> I don't want to bore you with this-n-that and what this camera does and it's shortfalls.  In short, it's a great camera.  I've had it for a couple of years now and have shot a little more than 13,000 photos.  In short, this camera has been outstanding.  Four months ago I bought a Canon EOS 30D (8 MP) thinking that I could improve my photos (I also needed a camera where I could change lenses).  But I was dead wrong in my thinking.  The Fuji S7000 out shoots it!  I know that may sound funny especially when you read all the kudos by professionals in the various photo magazines toward the 30D.  I know.  Who am I to say they're wrong.  I spent one afternoon shooting the same scene with both cameras.  Both cameras were set on a tripod to make everything equal.  Later that evening I printed eight pictures shot with the S7000 and with the 30D.  I took them to work and asked several people to tell which pictures they thought were the better.  In each case they all picked the ones shot with the S7000.  They were just a bit sharper.  The smaller details were clearer.  The Canon does have some nice features, but when you spend $1400 on a camera that has a higher MP rating you would expect it to produce a better picture.  Against the S7000 it loses.  Especially when you consider the price.I got my start in photography in the mid 1950's in Japan and haven't stopped.  I've had pictures published in magazines and books.  I grew up with 35mm and 2-1/4.  I can tell you without reservation that this is as good as any of the 35mm's that I own.  And a couple of those 35mm cameras are professional grade.  Now it's great to come home after a day's shooting and download everything into my computer in a few moments.  No more standing around waiting for things to develop and no more breathing chemicals.  No more washing prints and drying.  I just sit at the computer and produce pictures as good as anything I've ever shot.I seriously doubt that you'll find a camera that does everything you want and to the degree you want it.  Take a chance!  The S7000 will not disappoint you.  Believe me this is an outstanding camera!! </p>

 <p> This is my 2nd digital comera. I have been usingit for over 8 months. I am very happy with this camera.I agree with other reviews about the good photo qualityfrom this camera. Just to address something not heavilycovered by other reviews.1. I am using Hitachi's 2GB microdrive and MAGICSTOR's2.2G microdrive. No problem for continuous 5-shootingwith the highest resoultion setting (5-meg, fine),where each picture is about 4.8Meg byte in size.Microdrive is fast enough.2. With microdrive, this camera can capture >30 min ofvideo at its highest setting (640x320, 30-frame/sec).The video lenght is limited by my microdrive diskspace.3. With microdrive, the captured video does not showany slack, and dragging effects. You don't need touse xD-card for video capturing. The microdrive isalready fast enough for non-stop video capturing.4. This camera has very very good video capturing power.The captured video is better than my JVC camcorder.The color is more vivid. The focus is far more sharper.The audio capturing is more clear than my JVC camcorder.5. Excellent low-light video capturing power.Here is the best part, virtually all camcorders don'tcapture good videos under low-light condition. Thiscamera is very good in video capturing under low lightcondition. In a kid's birthday party, when all the lightis off, with only the few candle lights on the cake,it still can capture good video. Pretty amazing....I do a lot of video shootings for my 4 and 3 years olddaughters. Instead of using my camcorder, I use thisFuji S7000 most of the time for video capturings.I highly recommend this camera for both photo shooting andvideo shooting. </p>

 <p> I did a lot of research for my big move from the original HP 1 megapixel digital camera I have had for the last 3 years.  I wanted to purchase a camera that placed me close to my old SLR Film days and the Fuji S7000 is that camera and a whole lot more.I looked closely at products from Canon, Pentax, HP, and Nikon and found that dollar for dollar, the Fuji S7000 was an excellent choice.  The pictures that this camera takes are incredable to say the least.  I took pictures from 2 Meg up to the 12 Meg and also using the RAW settings, and the color saturation and clarity are awesome.  Obviously the best shots are at the 6 Meg level, but what range you have!  Wow!  Also, the Macro and Super Macro settings are a lot of fun and get the minute details that you really want with close up shots.Lastly, I have not run into any of the problems that I have read in a few of the prior reviews, ie. the battery drain from the CF Media or noise on film (I even tried the shot with the lens cap on and no lines (noise) recorded!) I did buy a double set of good quality rechargable batteries and have taken a lot of shots with no problems.  Buy it quick and (...) it's an even better buy!!!I love this camera and look forward to many years of fantastic photos! </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I work as a wedding/portrait photographer using high-end Fuji and Nikon DSLR cameras. DSLRs are excellent performers, but they don't make good family/travel cameras because of their bulk. When I decided to buy a new family/travel digital camera I wanted something that could perform almost as well as high-end DSLRs but in a relatively compact form with a low-end price.The ONLY camera that fit the bill was the Fujifilm FinePix S7000. I can't say enough about how great this camera is. The list of great things is too lengthy to go into, so I'll list the only two negative things about this camera. 1: The autofocus system is not as fast/reliable as what you can get on a higher-priced DSLR like the Nikon D70 or Fuji S2. But then, the S7000 is at least $500 less expensive. 2: The ISO noise/grain is worse than in a higher-priced DSLR, but you can remove ISO noise/grain easily using Photoshop or Photoshop Elements.If super-fast autofocus speed and clean high ISOs are what you "need" then I don't recommend the S7000. But for 90+ percent of people out there, the S7000 will make an EXCELLENT camera. </p>

 <p> I owned the Finepix S3000 for a couple years before I purchased this model about 6 months ago in late June of '04. I was EXTREMELY fond of my old camera so Fujifilm is where I looked first. I briefly considered a Sony and a Canon Digital Rebel but settled on the S7000 based on great reviews and amazing price."Disappointed" isn't even in my vocabulary!Excellent camera - it is my S3000 plus a whole net set of additional features: much faster shutter delay and focus, better lowlight shooting, fully manual settings, greater megapixel rating.The things rules. I rarely leave the house without the S7000.Hats off to Fuji, AGAIN! </p>

 <p> This is the best digital camera I got so far. The photos came out beautifully with sharp focus, brilliant and balanced color (no any color casting as one reviewer stated). Resolution is exellent. Even at 3 MP, it beats all competitors, like Olympus, Nikon, HP, Kodak etc. It's the only digital camera came with a shutter cable release which is incrediblly important for taking pictures at night or under dim light when a tripod is used. Its Raw Mode gives almost noise-free photo, as good as you can possibly get.For the price of $$$, it's a very good deal. It's basically a SLR with many nice features. its value is a way more than the price. I tested the shooting modes of P, SP, M, S, A, all were very satisfactory. The night view photo came out very good. I like its manual focus, too.I wish it were 10X zoom.Overall, I love this camera. I give it 5 stars! </p>

 <p> Actually, 4.5 stars.I only had a little time to run the S7000 through its paces, but that was enough to see that for a camera that can be had for $700, it is a price-point bargain.  It's not perfect, and I'll give a couple of examples, but overall, I'd give it very high marks.On the plus side, the 6x optical zoom lens is of excellent quality and the autofocus system works very well.  The focus and exposure electronics seemed to be faster than most, thus there is less of the notorius &quot;digital lag&quot;.  If you capture images in the least-compressed modes, you will get excellent results considering that the CCD is &quot;only&quot; 6 MP.  This thing, at its best, rivals my 8MP Sony.On the minus side, the S700 does not have continuous autofocus, so it that's a priority, you will find it lacking.  Also, I found the exposure of close-range flash pictures to be poor and beyond the range of compensation.  Aside from those caveats, this is a very fine device at a very reasonable price. </p>

 <p> I have a Fuji S5000 and thought it a good camera for the price. It takes sharp photos with great color under all conditions. I wanted to go to a 6MP camera and for the price the Fuji S7000 looked like a great deal. Boy was I wrong. My S5000 3MP takes better pictures than the S7000. The camera would not focus for anything. The indoor shots were horribly Under exposed and constantly fuzzy, even with the setting on sharp. The color was dull and the auto focus just does not work well in low light conditions (by low light I mean indoors where people like to shoot photos of their family). If your on a budget try the S5000 I think you'll be happy. If you can afford to go to the $1,000.00 range go with the Canon EOS. Or the new Sony 8MP camera. IF you buy the Fuji S7000 YOU'LL BE SOORRREEEE! </p>

After testing the S7000, I sold the G5 in favor of the S7000. The options exceed those of the G5, included 12MP image capability. A buddy of mine (you know him, Mr. Pro-photographer) said that digital camera's that do RAW format is the one to go with. I had no idea what he meant until I had one printed out. Stunning.As the QV-3000 and G5 had, and the S7000 has, the ability to use IBM Microdrives. I tested the seek/write times between the Microdrive and the xD-Picture card ... my recommendation is to dump the Microdrive. The xD-Picture card uses less power and seeks much quicker than the Microdrive. Well, not wanting to get rid of my investment, I was happy to find that I can use both the xD-Picture card and the Microdrive at the same time (in case I run out of room on the 256MB xD).Ease of use. In my family, I'm the one who figures techy stuff out (like the blinking VCR time). This time my wife figured this one out way before I did. We had it in the house for 1 day and when I came home, she told me of all the neat stuff it did. Very easy to use. </p>

 <p> This is the best camera you will find for under five hundred dollars.  I just spent all day taking pictures with it and I'm totally blown away by this camera's performance.Someone said that it doesn't autofocus enough but only one of the 200+ pictures I took today was out of focus.The camera is a little awkward to hold.  I almost always use a tripod anyway so that's a non-issue with me.Switching picture quality is really fast and simple.It's nice to be able to switch from the EYF to LCD screen with one button.The zoom is fast.It runs on AA batteries instead of a pack.  I ran out of juice today but I was able to canabalize the AAs from my MP3 player.  This made me realize how much better it is to just use common battery types instead of an expensive pack.The camera wrote to my xD picture card REALLY fast even on the higher quality settings.  This is probably more to the camera's credit than the card's but I love those little cards.  They're so tiny, I feel like I'm on star trek when I use them.It took exellent pictures!  Way better than my old kodak.It's auto mode is great for a beginner and its manual modes and settings would make it great for a back-up camera for a professional.Anyway, I'm very pleased with it.  It was fast to set up my shots, it wrote to the card fast, the pictues look good.** I would reccomend that you get a tripod or at least a monopod though since it lacks image stabilization. **:) I'm very happy with it.  :) </p>

 <p> The Fuji S7000 doesn't disappoint! I have used this camera for about 3-4 years and am still using it. If there is one camera you need to take with you in a hurry for any photography situation, this could be the one. The 6x optical zoom is more than competent for about 95 percent of most pictures, and if you need more then you can bump up the added 3.2x digital zoom (total 19x zoom). With this camera you can put in two memory cards at the same time (CF and xd), but of course it will read/write to only one at a time that you choose. But this gives you automatic backup, just switch to the other card if your primary card is full! Also, it shoots 30 fps video, so it's a good idea to get as big and as fast a memory card that you can. In the macro mode it can get as close as -inch, and I have taken many awesome close-ups! The built-in flash also has a rated range of nearly 28 feet at wide angle and 26 feet at telephoto! And it has a hot shoe so you can add a more powerful flash if you wish, if you needed it. I did have a disappointment with it in that because the lens is an external zoom (the lens zooms outward), it is not possible to attach a lens filter to the front of the lens. (When the lens is retracted, it is possible to attach a 55 mm filter, but then the camera won't operate because the lens can't pop out when the camera is turned on.) I believe Fuji sells an accessory tube that can be attached which is longer than the extended lens to allow the use of filters. (I was brought up on film SLRs, where every lens had a UV or haze filter to protect the lens.) Another quirk, which is a "good thing," is that this camera will shut itself down when battery power is low. It happened to me, but all I had to do was restart the camera, and it will continue to take pictures (and then shut down again). I know I am writing this review late, since the camera is already officially discontinued, but I happened to browse this site, and was impressed that the camera has such high rankings and such a loyal user base. </p>

 <p> This is my third S7000.  Not because the other two quit, but both were stolen.  After trying smaller Kodak and Vivitar cameras, I had to go back to the Fuji.  Although no longer produced, this camera fits so well in the hand, and the controls are so easy to manipulate I found myself scouring the internet for used ones.  The versatility of this camera, the quality of the pictures and videos and the design are some of the most comfortable features in a camera I've encountered in my 50 years of amateur photography. Some say the batteries drain quickly but I have found that using a high quality rechargeable makes that problem minimal.  And a 1gb XD card can store so darn many pics you could shoot for days. Fuji did a phenominal job on the model and I hope to use my third Fuji S7000 for many years. </p>

 <p> I've been using my FinePix S7000 for about three years now.  Overall, I've been extremely please with all aspects of the camera *except* for the following:1. The electronic zoom control is inoperative in the movie mode.2. *My* camera requires a re-boot when I switch from a CF card to an XD card.  No rebooting is required when I go the other way (XD to CF).  Fuji claims this is a problem that could be corrected with a new mother board, however, my camera is out of warantee and I'm not going to pay $175 to fix such a minor problem.I have taken literally thousands of pictures and I have to say that this camera has consistantly produced outstanding results.All considered, looking back to when I bought the camera, I made a good decision and would probably do it again. </p>

 <p> I bought this as an upgrade to my Fine Pix 2400 compact and haven't been disappointed.The electronic viewfinder has a big and clear display ,with a useful grid feature you can switch on and off to help with composing pictures to the rule-of-thirds. The battery life seems to be reasonable, and the memory options with XD clips and micro-drive compatibility is welcome for taking lots of shots at the 6.3 megapixel maximum before software does its thing to generate 12 megapixel files., which I haven't bothered with.Colour saturation looks a lot cleaner than with the smaller 2.1 megapixel 2400, and the 6X optical zoom works well, but a tripod and a cable release is necessary to avoid blurring of distant detail. The self timer could be used instead of a cable release, but this option might be too slow for some users who use maximum zoom on a regular basis.Downloading via USB 2.0 is significantly quicker than with USB 1, even so, the purchase of the XD/ smartmedia reader would be a good choice, especially if you intend to use the 128MB and higher  XD clips.A collar can be fitted to the main lens ring, with which you can attach filters. A polariser would be a good addition for getting crisp shots under bright light conditions.This camera can also be used to shoot short videos, and be used as a webcam.Although the battery life is reasonable, purchasing the optional power supply would be a good idea, especially if you intend to be using the flash unit a lot.This is a good camera. </p>

 <p> A BIG improvement over S602 model </p>

 <p> Having owned the Fuji Finepix S602, I recommended to two colleagues they consider it's next generation S7000. Both decided to buy it after examining and briefly using my S602. When I got a chance to play around one of theirs, I was immediately impressed with how much more responsive the S7000 autofocus was and how incredibly crisp it's shots were even in low light condition. On top of that the latency between shots was much better that the S602. The only thing I seem to dislike a bit is the autofocus mechanism which appears much noisier than its predesessor. I can hear it operating and making faint clicks all the time.I had my S602 for 2 years, loved using it, but disliked its low light performance. I managed to sell it and get the S7000 (...). Aside from the cost of the new XD card I needed to buy it is a GREAT deal, and I get new warranty to boot! A no-brainer purchase.The sturdiness of the S602 continues with the S7000. It is rock solid and comfortable in my hand. It is not comfortable for my wife however who prefers her own pocket sized Gateway 5.25 mp camera.Keep in mind that this Fuji camera feels much like a small 35mm camera and can be something that gets a bit tiring to lug around your neck. That said, I would rather carry it and have the ability to takes photos that are really outstanding with the Fuji S7000 camera. It captures images of stunning clarity and color better than all other digicams I have had the occassion to use or test except the Sony DSC F828 8mp unit. Considering the delta in price ($350 or more) the Fuji really stands out as the clear bargain and a pretty capable one also. Though not perfect it scratches enough itches to satisfy this casual photo taker.Many have underscored the issue of distorion caused by the firmware compression but I have not noticed anything objectionable so far. All 400+/- pictures I have taken are more than acceptable in that performance critereon. A new button near the 1.8" display makes resolution adjustments much easier than the prior model. Adjustments can be made in 1/4 the time. Great idea Fuji!. The only feedback of a negative nature on the menu system is in the means of performing a memory format. In the S602 it was very easy to do, in the S7000 it is now buried in a different menu and a bit more difficult to perform. This is a pretty minor issue however.All in all I believe anyone wanting one of the better digicams out there for considerably less than those High End Big names, walks away with a fine camera and hundreds to spend on other 'toys'! </p>

 <p> Update after half a year's experience </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Now that I've had the camera for several months its seems like a good time for an update, especially given some of the criticisms that have been leveled at the S7000.The short answer is that I still love the camera, even though it's not perfect. The long answer deserves some explanation.I have many years experience with 35mm film, but also many years experience with computers and computer graphics. Even today, film has capabilities that can't be matched with digital cameras, except possibly by cameras beyond the means of most people. On the other hand, digital photography has huge advantages in terms of immediate accessibility, cost per shot, electronic distribution, editing and enhancement, and the ability to control the printing process to get prints that look the way you want them to.My initial path into digital photography was to buy a film scanner and scan 35mm slides, which in some ways still represents the best of both worlds. But it is a time consuming and expensive (on a per shot basis) approach. My move into digital cameras has occurred in two steps. The first was to replace my &quot;little&quot; 35mm camera with a compact digital camera. For recording events and snapshot photography digital cameras became the preferred approach several years ago, and I'm on my second generation compact digital camera. I love being able to go to a family gathering, then go home and do a quick sorting and editing of the pictures, dump them on the web, and e-mail out a URL so everyone can see them while the gathering is still fresh in their minds.Replacing my 35mm SLR is a tougher problem, and one that hasn't been completely solved yet. The biggest issue I have is that the format of available digital sensors means that there are no really wide angle lenses available for reasonably priced digital SLRs. This, more than any other issue, keeps me from buying a digital SLR. I bought the S7000 as a way to get most of what my 35mm SLR does at a reasonable price, while retaining the 35mm SLR, the film in the refrigerator, and the film scanner as a backup until there is a digital SLR that comes close enough to my ultimate requirements that I'm willing to pay the extra money for it.The S7000 is a remarkably capable camera for the price. The wide end of the zoom is restrictive for me, but I have an adaptor and a  Raynox 0.66x lens that help. A fast 1GB compact flash card makes it easy to take a lot of pictures at essentially zero marginal cost. It is true that the lack of control over the compression is an occasional annoyance, but the compressed pictures usually come out very well.Then there is the noise issue. There is no question that if you want to blow up the images and look for noise you will find it. For many shots it's not an issue, but for clear skies and a few other situations you can clearly see it. In most cases screen images and prints of modest size won't show unacceptable noise, but there are situations where it will be evident. Note that there are tools available to make the nose less apparent in images, and if you only occasionally make big enlargements they may solve the problem (if it is one) for you.To continue on this issue, if I scan a slide from ten or more years ago I will generally get grain that is more evident than the noise in an S7000 image. Newer film, thanks to the intense rivalry between Kodak and Fuji in the 90s, has noticeably less grain, but it is still there. So it is all a matter of expectations. The S7000 can create images with noise no more evident than the film grain of days not long since past. Yes, for half again as much you can buy a camera with less noise, but is that a reason to criticize the performance of the S7000?The S7000 can create marvelous images at a great price. It doesn't quite match the capabilities of a cameras that cost significantly more, but why should it?I'm delighted with the S7000, and have taken a lot of pictures that I really like with it. I like being able to shoot hundreds of pictures without changing film. The battery draw bugs me a little, but the problem is not that I've ever had to stop while shooting to change batteries. The strange thing is that it draws down batteries while it is turned off, so I have to plan on inserting fresh batteries each day. But that's a small problem when you expect it.I keep up on what's happening in the digital camera world, and I knew when I bought it that it was possible to buy a better camera at a higher price. But, as I alluded to above, I'm waiting for the digital SLR system that gives me everything I want before I make a big investment, and this camera offered pretty much everything available at its price point or even a step or two higher. The one competing camera that intrigues me is the Sony DSC-F828, which has a wider zoom and a four color CCD mask. But it not only costs half again as much, it weighs nearly twice as much as the S7000. So I still think the S7000 is the right camera for me at this time. That doesn't mean that it is the right camera for everyone. But when you compare its strengths and weaknesses it should be clear why many people love it even though, as some critics point out, it certainly isn't perfect. But it is a very capable and fun camera! </p>
