 <p> Dead Awakenings is the perfect book for lovers of PNR&#8230;..and for those (like me) who don't read much of the genre. Evaine is a struggling college student who tries to make a quick buck by participating in a drug trial. She wakes up, days later, in a dirty, makeshift hospital. Next thing she knows, she's being rescued by the gorgeous Luca and taken to Haven House. Here, she learns what she is&#8230;&#8230;.a Deader, her body is dead but her brain still functions&#8230;..and now she has special powers.Evaine doesn't remember anything about her life. She doesn't know that she has a fiancee out there looking for her. Tristan is devastated by the disappearance of his love and will stop at nothing to find her. But while Tristan is looking for Evaine, Luca is watching Tristan. Luca and Evaine has a strange but very strong connection, one Luca doesn't want ruined if Evaine remembers.I loved Luca, strong and brooding, sweet and compassionate, gorgeous (even though he's undead). He tries to fight the pull Evaine has on him, but cannot fight their connection. He wants nothing more than to keep her safe. I felt so bad for Tristan. Also gorgeous and rich, Evaine refused to let him support her and wanted to keep their relationship a secret. When he sees Evaine, he too wants to protect her and keep her with him, even though she is not the same girl he fell in love with.Right away I knew this book was going to be different than anything I've read, and I was right!! I was hooked from the second chapter. This story is well-written, fast-paced and action-packed!! So unique. There were some crazy twists and turns, and it seems that the author left it open for another book. </p>

 <p> Ganiere gives a whole new meaning to the word undead. It's rare that I would choose a "zombie" book after seeing so many not-so-great movies involving them. Normally their characters are boring & lack what I crave, especially those whose main characters are zombies. However this book WOWed me in several instances! The lil' scientist in me was on overdrive as I attempted to piece it all together. Ganiere has major skillz when in it comes to hiding her secrets, choosing only to allow us teensy snippets at her leisure. This information leads us to our own conclusions only to divulge a bit more of those elusive pieces to the puzzle causing every scenario imagined to be wrong. LOLz The outcome happened to be a great one yanking us into the unknown ending with a jolt of AhMazing!! Oh, and let's not forget the killer cliffhanger!For those of you who have yet to delve into the undead fan club I will tell you I have never been much of an undead zombie type fan...Killing them yes, but actually getting to know & enjoy the undead zombie characters themselves no, not even in the movies. If you enjoy a great paranormal story full of mystery, suspense, action, chemistry (in more ways than one), & depth this book will please you while leaving you begging for more.Dead Awakenings...Warm Bodies has nothing on you! </p>

 <p> I received this book to review as part of a blog tour. This review is based on my honest opinion.You like paranormal romance stories? Try this one! A paranormal romance with a twist that you would never be expecting. I am not into zombie stories at all. And to honest when I realized that this is what the story was about I was totally regretting that I said I would do a review for the blog tour. But since I had already committed I told myself&#8230; just read it and hope for the best! I am really glad I did. This story was so well written and not your normal gross stiff walking zombies. The one has an actual story line and a good one at that.Zombies or as Rebeka called them, Deaders are dead but their brains are still alive. They each have a power and Evaine the main character her power is unlike any have ever had.The story begins with Evaine a college struggling student trying to make ends meet. She has a fianc&eacute; Tristen that is rich and can afford anything he wishes. He wants to take care of Evaine but she wants to make it on her own and does not feel right excepting any financial help.Evaine participates in a drug trial to make some extra money, this is where everything changes.  Days later she wakes up and is in a dirty, makeshift hospital. She is chained to a bed, confused and has no memory or her life. The next thing she knows she is being rescued and taken to a place called Haven House. This is where she learns what has happened to her and that she is in all actuality dead, but that her brain still functions and that she has special powers.The Deaders are forced to live underground hidden away and living on a special diet to help keep them from eating the &#8220;living&#8221;. Luca is one of her rescuers, she is attracted to him and he does not want to have feelings for a woman after losing the love of his life when he became an undead.  But he is having a hard time fighting the enviable.Tristen does eventually find Evaine, and does not want to let her go. He still wants her even thought she is dead so to speak. But Evaine is in love with Luca and it makes better sense&#8230; they are both technically dead right? Do you see the love triangle developing her&#8230;.Well if you want to know how the story plays out, you will just have to pick up the book yourself and see! I promise you will not be disappointed. This is a very well written story that has a plot and loveable characters the you will want to get to know better. </p>

 <p> If you&#8217;ve ever been a college student who has had to make ends meet on your own, you can relate to the Evaine and how she got into her predicament. Evaine wakes up tied town to a hospital bed with no memory of who she is or how she got there. All she knows is that all her senses are heightened.  The story follows Evaine through her journey of trying to adjust to her new self, and to remember who she is.Oh! From the beginning, one character made me sit up straight and go (!). I loved the subtle clues that something was up and not just casual conversation. A few chapters later I got more tidbits that made me go (!!). It kept me reading, what exactly was the point of those who were doing the experiments on people. Would their cover be blown? Would we find out the motivation? I NEEDED to know. Any book that causes you to ask questions and keeps you reading to find out is awesome in my book.  I really enjoyed that the info I wanted was slowly fed to me throughout the story, and had me putting the pieces together and trying to figure it out and NOT given to me in bits of 2 minute conversations that refused to let me try to figure it out.I love Rebekah's writing, it's engaging and makes you think, it doesn't think for you.Seriously if all zombie books follow the same path as this (not the same exactly, but the original take on zombies) then I would be in heaven. This book makes me really LOVE zombies as much as I love vampires and lycans. </p>

You fall in love with them.You feel what they feel.Before you know it you are so wrapped up in them you are rooting for them and not the humans!I was on edge through most of the book and could not put it down.Evaine and Luca are just to perfect for each other.Then you add in the drama of her &#34;Human&#34; fiance.... Yeah I said that.Tristen never gives up the hope of finding Evaine when she suddenly goes missing.Once he finds her he finds that all is not as should be.She is differant now.She's not human anymore.She's dead,but alive some how and not in ways you would think.Not human,not dead,not a vampire,not anything he had ever heard of.But he was determined to help her and win her back out of the clutches of the beautiful Luca.The Luca that she thinks is in love with.The Luca that is perfect in every way.I'm tellin ya'....You must read this gripping story!!

 <p> Hats off to the author, Rebekah Ganiere for dictating how I would spend my recent weekend!Being a Hopeless Romantic and lover of Creature, Horror, Fantasy, I walked with open arms into this luscious love triangle.It grabbed me from the first page, kept me hanging on every word.The story unfolds beautifully, the tension never-ending, I was there the whole time with Evaine, Luca and Tristan, immersed in their world of dead vs undead.Not your normal slow, groaning, grotesque, walking dead zombie.No, this is different, caught somewhere between superheroes and vampires, chiseled, sculpted, beautiful and gorgeous all wrapped up together.This is a fascinating and unique rendition of the Zombie genre.Exciting, Sexy, Impeccably executed. Extremely hard to put down.This is the most enjoyable read I have had in a very long time.I will recommend this to everyone I know.Sequel? OMG! I can&#8217;t wait!B. Rich Adams </p>

 <p> I don&#8217;t get to read many paranormal books of late but this is so much more as it crosses a couple of genres that make the read just that little bit more engaging and original.The plotline was a winner from the start and the characters extremely likeable, especially the main character Evaine. The world building was well executed and the author did not take the reader through complex evolvement that it was easy to understand and get enveloped into the story.I was a little hesitant when I read in the blurb that there was to be a battle of old love and new love, with zombies thrown in (kind of) but again this was cleverly played.I don&#8217;t want to divulge too much as this is covered in the synopsis of the book, however what happens is so much more. But I liked that the story unfolds without the need for rampant erotica, yes there were love scenes but they did not override the overall plot of the story.A totally absorbing read and for someone is no longer has paranormal on the top of her TBR list anymore, this has certainly broken that as I will definitely look forward to more from Ms Ganiere. </p>

 <p> ** I received copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I want to start this review by saying two things. One, the publisher of this book is my ex-publisher. While I have nothing positive to say about them, I still want to see their authors succeed. Two, paranormal books are not my thing, but I wanted to do a read and review to help the author out.Having said that, I think people who enjoy paranormal books would really like this one. Personally, I love zombies, but this is a much different take on zombies than I&#8217;ve seen. Deaders, as they call themselves, are reanimated humans, and much like the vampires in the Twilight series, they&#8217;re trying to be good and not feed on humans. Secret experiments are done on humans through some drug trial, which essentially turns them into these zombies-like creatures. Some even come back with special abilities, such as telekinesis and telepathy. I thought the story building was good and the concept was interesting.The story was written in third person, which isn&#8217;t my favorite. I personally have a tough time feeling connected to the characters in third person narrative, but I still thought they were well-developed and well-written. I had a good sense of their personalities and there was nice range of characters. Evaine is a struggling college student when she goes to this drug trial, and when she comes back she finds herself saved by a group of Deaders who are out to stop the trials. She and one of the leaders of the group, Luca, form an instant connection, something that neither one of them is prepared for. Luca has been a Deader for more than ten years, and after dealing with the loss of his love from his human life, he&#8217;s closed himself off. Evaine had a fianc&eacute; before the drug trial, and she didn&#8217;t expect to fall in love with someone so quickly, or so passionately.  Even though they try to resist, they find themselves more and more drawn together until they can&#8217;t deny their attraction. Then Evaine&#8217;s fianc&eacute;, Tristan, finds her. Honestly, I wasn&#8217;t a fan of Tristan. He ranged from being a push-over to a clingy psycho and most of the time I was really annoyed by his actions and the fact that Evaine couldn&#8217;t just let him go.As a whole, I thought the book was well-written and the story was unique. There are so many books out there that are just a carbon copy of a hundred others, that it&#8217;s nice to find something different for a change. Zombies you can actually like is unique for sure. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of paranormal romance. </p>

 <p> This book did not leave me disappointed.  From starting the first chapter I was instantly drawn into the world of the main character.  A character I am sure many females will be able to relate to.  Then the fun begins.  A strange new world, interesting characters, relationships and a storyline that progresses at the right pace.I love zombie movies and books etc.  But this is not your typical "Brains" zombie.  This is an exciting new genre of zombie.  To be honest zombies are so last year lol.  I still love zombies, but the point I am trying to make is, don't look at this book and think, ugh another zombie book.  Trust me, it isn't.You will be immersed in the characters world, have your heartstrings tugged, be caught up in the struggle of dead versus the undead and be kept hanging on every word, you won't even notice turning the pages.So what are you waiting for, go and get this book now, links posted below!Congratulations to the Rebekah R. Ganiere, may you have many future successes![...] </p>

 <p> Dead Awakenings... where to begin?This is one of the books that I was most excited to review in recent times.  I'd watched the trailer and read up on the posted Amazon reviews and scoped out the author's FB page (you know, like any good book stalker does, right?)First things first -- Rebecca Ganiere has a way of putting things into words that really keeps you glued to the book.  I didn't want to put it down from the first few words in.  I just had to know what happened next and I may or may not have taken my Kindle everywhere I possibly could have to finish the book up in one day.  I couldn't put it down!  Her style of writing is superb, and kept the suspense up.I couldn't help but relate to Evaine -- she's an independent woman, who although she didn't have the greatest upbringing, strives to do the best she can and make sure she's self sufficient.  She has the perfect Fiance, that realistically she could have leaned on for support, more than just emotionally, but financially as well, but she chooses not to.  She chooses instead to participate in a drug trial in order to make a few bucks to survive.  This is where everything in her world changes.  When she wakes up in the hospital chained to a bed with no recollection of her life, things start coming into play.  You can check out the synopsis below for the rest of the basics, of course!The suspense is gripping throughout the story and as the Deaders bring Evaine into their family, the plot really begins to thicken.  This isn't your typical, every day *yawn* of a &#34;zombie&#34; book... this takes the human factor into account, and the fact that this particular Deader has a past life and a love determined to find her when she disappears.  This complicates things, especially as the story goes further.Although I do love a good steamy scene once in awhile, I was very glad that this book didn't have anything too graphic.  This is a book I can share with my teenage son, and know that nothing is going to tarnish his &#34;angelic&#34; brain... hey, let this mom believe he's innocent still, ok! ;)  I love when we can share a book and discuss it, and this is one he'll be reading in the near future, for sure!I HIGHLY recommend reading this one.  I love a good paranormal book, and this one doesn't cease to deliver.  Amazing characters, a great story line, fabulous writing... it's all there and you won't be disappointed!  I can't wait for the next one!! </p>

 <p> Ireceivedthis book from Paranormal Romance & Authors that Rock in exchangefor an honest review. Thanks for the fabulous read, guys! I absolutely loved this book. I mean, I REALLY loved it. Like, I did nothing but read all day for 2 days while my kids trashed my house, kind of love.So, Evaine, a regular old struggling college student turns zombie. That's right, folks. Zombie! You wouldn't think that zombies could be kick-ass and sexy but they totally are. Trust me! I am the new authority on Zombies. Well, besides Rebekah R. Ganiere, that is. ;) Well, it turns out that there are other zombies out there for Evaine to family up with and in true &#34;keeping it all in the family&#34; form she falls for one, Luca, who is all kinds of bad-ass zombie hotness. Ahhh, but what about Tristan, her fiance from her normal and boring human life? Whats a good zombie story without a love triangle, right?This book was REALLY well written. It was super easy to read and I loved all of the characters. I really love it when I read a book and I feel like I am there, walking the halls, kicking ass, or kissing a sexy zombie. He he! This book did not have a cliff hanger but I cannot wait to read the rest of this series. I want to make sure that a certain someone gets his Happily Ever After! I want to know what happens with a certain pair of crazy delusional zombies! I want, I want, I want! So hurry the hell up and write! Please ?! You hit the nail on the head with this one, Ms. Ganiere! You might just be my new author crush. Don't mind me while I am all fangirling and stalking your facebook page. </p>

 <p> Reviewer: Kris on behalf of I Heart BooksRating: &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60; (4 & )4% in I knew this was going to be very different &#8230; and in a very good way. This book blew me away. It was such an original view for me that I was hooked from the beginning.A whole new breed of monster to fall for. Speaking of falling for &#8211; Luca. Well, Tristan, too.Zombies &#8211; or as they prefer; Deaders &#8211; are still living (err&#8230; you know what I mean) basically human existences. Though they are forced to live underground and mostly hidden, surviving on a diet that keeps them from giving into the primal urges of &#8230; zombiedom (I totally made that word up).Evaine, a theater wiz was down on her luck when she reluctantly takes the advice of a respected mentor and calls a medical research group for some extra cash. She wakes confused with heightened senses and a group of strange men hovering over her. Reluctantly she takes to their lifestyle, much quicker than most in her situation, and flourishes.Luca, hasn&#8217;t allowed himself feeling for the last 10 years. Since his rebirth &#8211; when he was forced to watch his love move on. He doesn&#8217;t take kindly to the fact that this new woman is stirring feelings in him.There was a lot to this book. I&#8217;m sure it could have been wrapped up in a smaller, neater package, but I feel this was set up perfectly for additional books. And the cast of secondary characters to choose from for more books is astounding. Any shorter and they would have felt 2D. There were parts that while reading I didn&#8217;t think much of, just to find out later in the book that it all had a purpose. There was not a lot of mindless filler plot here. The world was well fleshed out and the plot was both exciting and comfortable.I got to the end of the book before I realized that the author had left out gratuitous sex and lengthy, vivid sex scenes and for that I am THANKFUL! The vague and attentive love scenes were just that &#8211; love scenes.I look forward to more! </p>

 <p> Deaders! Great twist on the zombie trope. Rebekah Ganiere's debut novel got this reader to embrace the walking dead for the first time. The romantic elements are so well drawn in this creepy, dystopian world, it draws the story miles away from the overdone &#34;hero battles legions of zombies&#34; plot. Can't wait to read more from this promising new author! </p>

The book blurb caught my interest and from start to finish Dead Awakenings was intense, plausible and worth every minute my eyes were glued to the Kindle. The story was well written and the author expertly drew the reader into the fears, struggles and desires of Evaine and Luca. </p>

 <p> Evaine is a struggling college student.  She refuses to take money from her rich fiance, Tristan.  Shortly after meeting with her advisor at school, Evaine wakes strapped to a table with no memory.  She has no idea who she is.  She can barely function.  All her senses are heightened.  All of a sudden a group of men storm her room and attack the people around her.  They take Evaine out of that horrible place.  Can she trust these people that rescued her?  What happened to her?  Will she remember her past?  Can she move forward with Luca, the one she&#8217;s connected to?I absolutely loved this book.  I&#8217;m hereby singing its praises and shouting from the rooftops.  It was a great adventure and totally different than anything I&#8217;ve read in awhile.  I&#8217;m not sure if you&#8217;d call Evaine and her group of &#8220;Deaders&#8221; zombies or vampires.  I loved the interactions between the characters.  I hated the way Luca treated Evaine in the beginning.  Pushing her away because he had no time for love and newborns.  The author did a great job of evoking the emotions the characters were feeling.  I felt just as lost and alone as Evaine.  I also felt Luca&#8217;s fear of losing Evaine to Tristan.  The twist at the end of the book, I didn&#8217;t see it coming until it happened.  Absolutely brilliant.  I&#8217;m definitely adding this author to my must read list. </p>

 <p> Sometimes the people that you believe are on your side are really only out for themselves.....Evaine Michaels is a strapped for cash college student, trying to make her own way in the world.  Her life growing up was nothing but turmoil and she wants to be nothing like her mother!  She's determined to do this on her own; which is why she refuses to go to her fianc&eacute;, Tristan, for help.  Instead, she seeks out one of her theater advisors to figure out something so that she can make her rent, yet still graduate on time.  Mac Peterson presents her with an opportunity that just might be her saving grace.... or it just might be the end of her existence as she knows it.Who would have thought that Zombies could be kick ass and sexy?  Yep, that's right...I said Zombies.  After signing up for a drug trial, Evaine wakes up...and she's not quite....alive anymore.  They call themselves Deaders, but really they are just zombies.  But this isn't like Night of the Living Dead zombies, nor are they World War Z zombies... they crave human flesh, but still have most of their humanity...most of them do anyway.  Sometimes things go wrong when they are &#34;rebirthing&#34; and they don't come all the way back to being... human?  It's really quite an interesting concept.  What separates this zombie novel from the rest?  This one's from the zombie's perspective.Ever read a zombie novel with a love triangle? Another first as far as I can tell.  The author really does a fantastic job of creating characters that are full of life (HA, kind of ironic huh?) and human on almost every possible level.  They band together and create a safe haven for others like them to live.  Of course they don't have normal jobs, but thankfully one of the founders of Haven House has enough  money to keep everything going and fund their excursions to find the people responsible for creating them and hopefully ending all of this.This book just gets better and better every single chapter; it's one of those that's extremely hard to put down.  The author keeps the dialogue punchy and finds a balance between the elements of supernatural, romance, and survival.  The character interaction is very fluid and the dialogue keeps you interested and never quite relinquishes it's grip on you.Does Evaine try to go back to her old life and make things work with Tristan?  Does she stay at Haven House and make a new life with Luca, her sexy zombie savior? Do they find the &#34;drug trial&#34; operation and put an end to all of this human experimentation?  Do they ever find out why any of this is even going on?  The answers are.....well, you have to read it to find out.This is obviously the first in what will be a series (whether a trilogy or more I'm not sure).  The cliffhanger ending is the perfect lead-in for the next novel.  Fans of horror, zombies, fantasy, supernatural and romance will have enjoy this one.  It&#8217;s zombies...with love triangles and emotional twists along the way. </p>

 <p> This story reeled me in from the very start. Loved the characters, the plot was fresh and kept me turning pages. There were action packed scenes, scenes that made my heart ache for the characters, and holy moly...there were some HOT HOT HOT scenes too! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes paranormal, romance, or just any well told story with a great plot! </p>
