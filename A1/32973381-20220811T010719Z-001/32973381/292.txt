 <p> You see everything changed to color but all these old classics seem to lack that.  The cover is in colorand the ad's in color but not the shows themselves.  I don't care for any of those who won't tell you truthas to color or not.  I liked the shows but not the people who never inhanced to color. </p>

 <p> The only reason that I have given this set 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the packaging,there are 2 DVD plasic cases within a cardboard box and one of those cases has 3 DVD piggybacking on a central hub, the other case is okay with 2 DVD on individual holders.I fixed this problem by the use of a plastic container of my own with 3 separate holders, this fixed a problem that should not been allowed to start with as I take pride with my extensive collection and could not accept this "stacks on the mill" technique to hold discs, especially with a series such as "Sea Hunt" of which I have very fond memories then living along the Indean Ocean coast, it is good to see that season 2 of Bat Masterson does not have that problem.I needed to dispose of my "Becker" series to use those containers, I am used to doing that over the years with other purchases and I will no doubt have to repeat this with "Sea Hunt" and "Highway Patrol", I am still using the cardboard boxes with removable lid to hold these containers, these are useful in both having good cover pictures and having overall episode lists on the back.In the earlier release of Bat Masterson  Collectors Edition by Ziv Television Productions United Artists are these words:"Works presented on this DVD are in public domaincontent researched finding all copyrights expired or lapsed thru time on non-renewalaccordingly we claim ownershipand are legally authorized to replcate without permission or license."{At least the MGM logo is still present on the packaging.}Do not bother searching for any extras on this new release for there are noneor any real information at all, they are products looking and sounding greatbut lacking any love for the product, but then I suppose these days that is nothing new.I am though very grateful to own these as they are so much better than the releaseof a few years ago of "Sea Hunt" in 2006 and "Bat Masterson" at about the same time. </p>

 <p> Love Gene Berry in Burkes Law so wanted to see the thing that made him famous. Like classic westerns? The men were men and they showed it? This is it. The history is probably very loose, but who cares? It is just a great way to enjoy a rainy afternoon.  It is black and white and from the early days of television so the quality of &#34;today&#34; isn't there. But it is well done. </p>

 <p> I really enjoy this television series.  Gene Barry is great as a tough, but dandified, Western hero with a good sense of humor and a strong sense of justice.  The many notable guest stars are fun to see and the stories are solid and quite entertaining.  The picture and sound quality are also worthy, especially considering this is television from half-a-century ago!  Bat Masterson is a fine series for adults and children, and at $12 a season, it's a steal. </p>

 <p> I've just received the Bat Masterson first season set and, despite what the initial review said, this is a five-disc set, not single disc, beautifully packaged and an incredible bargain.  The second season is on the way, and I hope the third will follow. </p>

 <p> How can a collection that contains only the first twelve episodes be considered a &#34;Best of&#34; collection. Season One, Part One would have been more appropriate. Go for the extra few bucks and get &#34;The Complete Season One&#34;. Even the &#34;Marathon Set&#34; is a better value. Don't for get to pick up Season Two while you're at it. </p>

 <p> This was a fairly good series, well acted and produced.  You have to be a fan of Gene Barry to like this one.  I met him many years ago at the Calgary Stampede in Calgary Alberta Canada where he was the special guest.  He promoted his series quite well.  I am not to sure how historical each episode was.  They made reference to the year each story represented.  This series was quite entertaining. </p>

 <p> Gene Barry made Bat Masterson come alive and the series seem realistic although far from it, it was good entertainment with the TV people creating a wholesome strong, likeable good guy with just a twist of larcney yet a class act.  Gene Barry did the part well and after this ended he moved on to several other series not lasting that long but all just as well directed for fun and enjoyment </p>

 <p> If you like old TV Westerns then this is one of the better ones </p>
