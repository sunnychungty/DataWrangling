 <p> Not once have I not been drawn in and consumed by each and every episode.Once is never enough with this superbly written and performed drama.It really gives an uncomfortable close up to how shallow "the beautiful people" can be.The villains are the creepiest/scariest people.  Great casting as well.In a word Great! </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Nip and Tuck is just a TV show, the fact that we buy the dvd means its good enough to add to our libraries.  Manufacturers take advantage of this market three ways to sunday.  First we have Sony putting out the first season to dozens of shows and then not following up with the rest of the seasons. Thus leaving our libraries incomplete. Then we have writers striking for better wages and manufacturers use this as an excuse to sell mediocre packages of media at prime prices. Now we have half of a season selling at the price of what it would cost to purchase the complete season. All in all, there are laws to put us away for smoking too close to a building and spitting on the sidewalk but manufacturers can get away with manipulating sales by how they put out materials. Where is the law that protects the customer. The law that says, hey you promise quality goods and you get paid for it, so pony up boys, pony up and give quality where quality is due. Sony, Fox or michael jackson and anyone else that has cornered the market on media manipulation should be held accountable. So no, I am not giving my hard earned cash to Amazon or anybody else for half a box of media. It makes no sense at all, and I am sure that their sales must be reflecting this if the american public is as fed up as I am with this media hazing. </p>

 <p> i have no idea how such a fantastic show could have fallen so far. Really, its quite sad. this season is terrible, the charecters do things they would never do, it makes no sense, the story arcs start and end within two or three episodes making it chaotic and just plain stupid. while the acting is still fantastic, and you cant help but feel so bad for watching these actors go through this, i cant totally pan the season. still, its real bad. </p>

If FX keeps pushing the button in this direction, NIP/TUCK will be gone...and not missed by many people. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> WOW, I can't believe Season 5 received so many bad reviews. Our favorite bad guy, Christian Troy, as well as his sexually deviant side kick Kimber, is up to their old tricks. The Julia McNamara character is as socially helpless as ever and Sean is struggling with being the consummate doormat. The Matt character got a chance to spread his acting wings (although I'm glad he didn't go thru with the gay sex scene). I hate to see the Gina character released because I loved her sexually needy character. The Eden character was a nice addition to the storyline and John Schneider, turns in some convincing performances as porn king Ram Peters. For all those sour puss reviewers, the underlying theme of the show has always been superficiality (or the fulfillment of needs thru superficial means) that's why the show started off in Miami, and moved to Los Angeles. The show is about need, loneliness, inferiority issues, sexual abuse and damaged souls; shouldn't we expect a little craziness? Of course we should! I haven't watched the special features portion of the set yet, but I was dying to finish the season first. I think this season is a keeper. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Totally Out of Control </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> After much thinking, I have finally figured out the system the writers of this show must have: 5 boxes on a table.  Box #1 contains character names on slips of paper. #2 contains couples on the slips. #3  has various acts of treachery on the paper slips.  Box #4 contains slips with various diversified sex acts on them.  And Box #5 contains slips with Plastic Surgery operations such as penile enlargement, breast reduction, etc.  Take a slip at random from #1 and match it to a slip from #5.  Take another slip from #1 and  match with a slip from #3.  Get 3 slips from  #2 and match them up (at random, of course) with 3 slips from Box #4. And there's your show.  The contrast is amazing--fabulous actors giving reality to a storyline that spins and careers out of control!This season features a wide selection of troublesome women. There's the Monroe-ish Kimber, who has a heart the size and temperature of a frozen pea,  and has an ego with the size and toxic atmosphere of Jupiter. There's Colleen, a "stuffy" old hag. Kate is the ultimate drag: she goes around with an unhappy look on her face, and Sean spends 99% of his time talking, trying to get her to smile. When she does, the smile disappears after 3 seconds. Definitely a high-maintenance relationship.  Julia also spends the season having a hysterical fit every 5 minutes. She upbraids Sean for his infidelities while she cheats on him. When she finally gets her comeuppance, I almost feel like cheering.  But the real dark-entity of this piece is Eden: an evil trollop par excellence. Eden's narcissistic ego rivals Kimber's, but unlike Kimber she has no heart. She gives psychopaths a bad name. She can't screw over enough people fast enough, and her mother Olivia is as stupid as she is rich.  The potty-mouthed Gina also puts in an appearance again, just to strike fear into Christian Troy's heart. Add to this about 100 lies, several murders, some gory operation scenes, and mix well, for a show that truly entices.In this season, Liz Cruz shines as never before. She is the stable anchor to the madness going on all around her and it's when Liz is on camera, that the audience knows that reason will somehow prevail. This is a good season, even worth the 2-part cost. </p>

 <p> I was excited and all set to purchase this dvd as I own the other seasons until I realized that it is not the complete season.  Why would anyone in their right mind pay this astronomical amount (the same I paid for the entire season sets I got when they were released), only to have to pony up more money when the remaining episodes are released.  While I love Nip/Tuck, I will not spend my hard earned money on a set that is not a complete season release.  I refused to do so when 30 Rock did this, and I will not do so now.  I say wait until the complete season is released and consider making the purchase at that time. </p>

 <p> Nip Tuck is an amazing show- it definitely challenges the "norms" of society and stretches it characters in all different directions.  This season was not its best; however, it drew viewers in through its shock value and interesting spins on the old, favorite characters.  I can't wait for next season! </p>

 <p> This is probably best for an established nip/tuck viewer, as it must be the darkest season I've seen.  Definitely not something to watch for joyous reasons-lol But if you like nip/tuck to start with, you'll like this season too.Extremely bizarre of course, and even slightly depressing at times. But why did I keep watching?  I guess because of that bizarre edge, you never really know what the heck is coming around the corner. One thing I will say is that all the sex scenes were distracting to me.  They seemed contrived.Julia has a life transformation (I won't spoil it for you) that I found extraordinarily silly~but that's just me.  Christian seems to be sinking into the gutter deeper and deeper.  Sean's temper becomes a major focus.  And Matt and Kimber are as delightfully dysfunctional as ever.  I give this season four stars. </p>

 <p> The show took a drastic turn for the worse in Season 5 part 1. We see Dr. Sean going for an 18 year old, Matt continues to fall madly in love with anyone that says "hello" to him. Julie develops a taste for females. It just goes too far over the top. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> The fifth season of Nip/Tuck finds Sean (Dylan Walsh) and Christian (Julian McMahon) setting up their practice in the most synthetic town on the planet: Hollywood.  It takes a while for things to take off, which they do when Sean and Christian end up stumbling into playing parts on a TV medical drama, and contending with its egotistic star (Midnight Meat Train's Bradley Cooper) while Sean romances its female lead (Paula Marshall).  There's some inventive twists that are abound, including the downward spiral that Matt (John Hensley) and Kimber (Kelly Carlson) are on, and Julia's (Joely Richardson) surprising new realationship.  There's pivotal guest star roles from Portia de Rossi, John Schneider, and sexy AnnaLynne McCord, and Nip/Tuck still manages to be entertaining five seasons in, even though this season just simply isn't as good as previous seasons of the series.  Still, there's a cliffhanger ending that will have you salivating for more to come, and here's hoping that Nip/Tuck will continue to deliver the goods. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I loved the first few episodes of this season.  The move from Miami to Hollywood provided a change of scene, the opportunity for new characters, and the chance for Sean and Christian to develop further.  And then two horrible things happened: Julia and Matt returned.  And with them, all the whining that peppered the last season.  And then Gina?  C'mon! Things became so ridiculous that by the time Julia developed amnesia, I was laughing aloud and thinking I tuned into "As the World Turns" by accident.  A once sharp, funny, engaging show has become a parody of itself.  And we're not talking self-satire here either.  Extremely disappointing. </p>

 <p> "Another Great Season" </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> "Nip/Tuck" returns for another wonderful season with a brand new locale. Creator and producer Ryan Murphy wisely decided to keep the series fresh by moving "Nip/Tuck" to Hollywood where Christian and Sean move their plastic surgery practice. Other series regulars like Matt, Liz, Kimber, and Julia are along for the ride and the series looks fresh and innovative. Most TV dramas become boring and sluggish in their fifth year, but by moving our beloved "Nip/Tuck" to the Southland gives the show real newness and originality in their plotlines and characters. Besides what better place to have a show set that deals with plastic surgery than Los Angeles? There are also a slew of great guest-stars that pop up this year including John Schneider, who plays a porn producer, and Rosie O'Donnel who reprises her role as Dawn Budge. However, it is Sharon Gless' virtuoso performance as a so-called agent that steals the spotlight this year. To say that Gless' performance is blood curdling is an understatement. She even received an Emmy nomination for her role.This boxset features the first 14 episodes that were filmed in season 5. There was originally suppose to be 22 shows filmed that year but due to a writer's strike only 14 were shot. The 8 remaining shows from season 5 are being released in October, 2009 in a separate set called "Nip/Tuck-Season 5, Part 2". I am sure that in time a complete Season 5 boxset will be released. However, if you can't wait to view these 14 shows, like me, buy this set: these  episodes are some of the best the series has made!On a final note "Nip/Tuck" went dark on June 19th, 2009, meaning the show finished filming permanently. The series returns to the airwaves October, 2009. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> The series has now officially moved to sunny, fruity, nutty California, a fantasy world where two very busy plastic surgeons somehow find enough time in each day to have multiple affairs, operate, and work on a TV soap opera as well.  Julia's got a new lover, Sean and Christian feud with and forgive each other by turns, Matt still makes dumb decisions constantly, Kimber is still a mess, Gina makes trouble until it's no longer an issue for her, Linda rolls her eyes at the insanity, and Liz is, sadly, stuck mostly in the background this time around.Also, be sure to watch the gag reel.  Julian is a riot.Goofy, incredible, unrealistic, and steamy hot fun. </p>
