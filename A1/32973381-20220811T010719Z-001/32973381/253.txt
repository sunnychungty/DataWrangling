 <p> Philip Gardiner suggests a "gateway" to the afterlife and offers as evidence a variety of beliefs from a vast array of cultures.  It's all interesting, but making the leap to the conclusion "therefore there is another world" is still a leap of faith and not science, I think.  Since all sorts of people throughout the ages believed in another world, that doesn't necessarily make it true, despite all the connections, coincidences and circumstantial evidence Gardiner presents in this DVD.More convincing is Gardiner's attempt to reconcile Quantum Physics with religious belief.  The possibility of amazing dark and fantastic occurrences is truly intriguing and really sparks the imagination. </p>

 <p> Prepare to have your mind blown.  Philip Gardiner's revelatory follow up to QUANTUM MIND OF GOD should be required viewing for anyone with an interest in the afterlife.  It seems silly to propose that the answer to the age-old life after death question could be definitively given in a documentary, but, well...  If you're interested in this stuff, you need to see this.  It truly opened my eyes to a new understanding of death. </p>

 <p> What are you expecting when you buy a DVD? I was expecting to have a narrator take me places and discuss what we were looking at. I expected to see moving pictures with people in them talking to me or showing me things. I was expecting that the DVD version would provide me with something a book would not. From the intro, where they play an entire folk song while you watch still images of little interest dissolve into each other, to the film itself which only adds narration to the same intro format, this DVD is unbearable and I will not watch it again...EVER.This is nothing more than a series of processed images set to annoying songs that alternate between vaguely medieval sounding OOh-ahh music and loud ear spliting fiddle music. Worse yet, the images seldom have anything to do with the narration and are low resolution. That means they are twice as annoying on your big screen TV.Cheesy dissolves of the universe fade into stained glass church windows and then its on to shots of the same boat sailing past a city in different colors. Halfway through this hour long film, you begin to notice that most of the images are being reused continuously. It is as if someone said I'll make a slide show while you read passages from your book and we will sell it for lots of money. There are tons of ugly polarized images and they repeatedly show a shot of the horizon and a bad model of earth which appears to be made of Paper Mache. When the images do match the discussion, you don't get much. An example is the roughly drawn still of the interior layout of the great pyramind. Is the one you have seen often enough to draw yourself and he "animates" it by changing its color several times.The information is interesting but hard to listen to because the music is so loud. If you want to know about this subject by this author, buy the book. Believe me you'll be begging for it by the end of this pseudo-film. This is an annoying waste of time. It is by far the worst DVD I have ever bought and I teach film. I also bought the the one on the Thoth Cross. It has a wailing guitar in the background of what could have been an interesting narration...and yes...constant interludes of folk singing set to computer images of the Thoth cross dissolving in different colors. You couldn't pay me to own another film by this company, Reality films. I would suspect that this entire series has similar production values and should probably be avoided.You may notice that even the reviewers linked to magazines that make their money hawking films like this give relatively low marks to some of the DVD's in this series. Read the low reviews first and if any echo what I've said here, heed their advice. You may also notice as I did (too late) that with one or two exceptions ALL OF THE 4 and 5 star reviewers of Gardiners films appear on ALL of Gardiner's films and for the most part are given low marks by other reviewers. They also don't seem to have much of a review history beyond his films. What does that suggest to you??UPDATE:  I made the mistake of using the fast forward on my new Sony Blu-ray player to advance through the film. It stalled my player so badly that I could not even turn it off and had to unplug it and then restore power to eject the DVD. I tried to again fast forward to the picture I wanted and the same thing happened. This product is seriously flawed. </p>

 <p> This is a continuation of the subject matter in Quantum Mind of God with Philip Gardiner. This installment discusses the significance of "the void," or the part of atoms and the universe that cannot be seen, rather than what we can see, also that we are all balanced genetically with the resonance of the earth (the chord F#) and should be able to understand information that way. While the computer graphic and other visual effects make it easy to watch, the information is somewhat esoteric and it is helpful to know about the subject matter. </p>

 <p> I have seen nearly all of his DVDs and read most of his books.  I admire his ability to gather information.  Some of his books are real gems.  Other times, I get the impression he has rushed some material together for the sake of publishing something new.  I think this one falls in to the "rushed" category.There are some good points in the movie, but I think this is better rented than bought. </p>

 <p> This is the second film in the 2-part "Quantum Mind of God" series.  Gardner combines ancient spiritual teachings with modern quantum physics to explore the ideas surrounding life after death.  He connects all of this to ancestral "truths" dealing with health and healing, universal harmony, and time/realm travel.To be honest, the production quality of the film could be a bit better, but this doesn't detract too much from the fascinating content. </p>

 <p> I just learned that the earth and human DNA have the same frequency and that frequency is F# (sharp). F# (sharp) frequency can transfer energy and information. So if we use our super conscious or unconscious mind to tune into that frequency we can go to another world after this life.  I am speechless; this film has blown my mind. </p>

 <p> DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!  This is the worst presentation I have ever watched-Its more like a power point presentation witha  a lava lamp used for special effects and some funky music that played in the back ground. Only someone on LSD trippin out would understand this DVD.There was no speaking, no acting, no explainations about any of the topic this DVD was supposed to present. I have never askked for my money but this time I am, only because this DVD was that bad.Plus the information was rediculas. I am ashamed I even bought this-BIG WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY </p>

 <p> Continuing the fantastic metaphysical journey begun by "Quantum Mind of God", Gateways to the Otherworld confronts a question as old as humankind's primordial consciousness: is there life after death? Offering a technique through which we can travel to the "other realities" that exist within ourselves, and tapping into the power of quantum physics, documentary producer Philip Gardiner undergoes his own experiments to prove his points and reveals that ancient humankind is far more advanced than previously thought. In an amazing blend of science and mysticism, Gateways to the Otherworld tells of the universal frequency that allows the mind to travel to other realms; the "quantum entanglement" connection; the secrets of the Great Pyramids; methods of healing nearly lost to time that could benefit all of humanity; and much more. A welcome and highly recommended addition to metaphysical studies DVD shelves. </p>

 <p> Looking at the possibilities of varying realities within us sounds like something out of a science fiction movie or book but in this film, Gardiner addresses it as a reality.  This second installment to Quantum Mind of God is just as interesting and thought provoking. </p>

 <p> While the "film" part of this DVD isn't the most interesting, the information in it is priceless.  I simply played it while I did some chores and tending to some other things around the house.  Who doesn't like hearing about life after death and alternate realities?!  Surely, we must exist in some form when our bodies have died.  To think that we simply exist no more seems like an absolute waste of time in being alive at all.  Why have thoughts and feelings and logic if we're nothing more than ants?  That's the main reason I enjoyed Gateways to the Otherworld.  It delves deep into the mysteries of the pyramids, the fact that our ancestors may have had a way to tap into other realms, and healing methods that are ancient but could prove helpful to this day.  For an interesting blend of mysticism and science, I'd recommend this film. </p>

 <p> In this interesting sequel to The Quantum Mind of God, Philip Gardiner brings the science of quantum physics and his knowledge of ancient cultures together to answer the question: is there life after death?Fascinating subject to listen to, and the idea that ancient man had knowledge of and put into practice these things that we are just now rediscovering is amazing. </p>
