 <p> It was a cute story and I liked that it as about Caleb. We get to learn more about his past and he gets a cute little mate. It was a quick adventure with a happy ending. We even get to see what Sam and his pack have been up to. I like the world and I like the wolves in it, different twist to the whole werewolf myth. It's a great read and it can be stand alone but I woudl recommend Wolf Bait as well to get the whole picture. Looking forward to the next book by Perdita whether it's continuing these guys or a new story. </p>

 <p> I liked this book. Wild, one of the MCs, made the book for me. He's an omega deemed unworthy of care by his old pack, kicked out at age 13, & survivor of the wild for the past 5 yrs. He's caught in a trap by a farmer but rescued by Caleb just in the nick of time. Caleb takes him home to heal & the story unfolds from there.Wild is young, only 18, and he can be impetuous at times, w/ the absolute strength of conviction that only an 18 yr old may have, but he's totally like-able & it is this unwavering conviction that works so well w/ his character. He chips away at Caleb's resolve not to love again, slowly but surely.I really liked how their relationship developed. There is angst for Wild because he thinks Caleb doesn't find him worthy enough, fighting their attraction. Why else would Caleb not claim Wild as his mate? The reason is told in flashbacks of Caleb's own backstory as wolf bait turned werewolf by his 1st lover, his 1st love, as he believed then. This relationship lays the foundation by which Caleb lives his life for future ones, namely, live his own life & deny the werewolf ways as folklore, such as the mate bond. He initially fights his attraction & mate bond to Wild, but Wild overcomes his reticence through sheer power of will, loyalty, & devotion. Their sexual attraction was... well, sexy. I liked this pairing of little wolf to the big white wolf.The characters from the 1st book in the series make a few appearances in this book as well. Sam & his men get involved in the MCs' search & destroy mission of the hunter who is laying traps for their kind. There is jealousy on Wild's part for Sam since he's insecure about Caleb, & he doesn't know how Sam fits in Caleb's life. Of course, this all gets worked out by the end. The valley pack & Caleb/Wild are not best chums by the end, but they work things out.I liked this 2nd story better than the 1st one. The MCs in Wild are more like-able than in the 1st book, Alpha Bait, & I felt more vested in their story. Wild was sweet, earnest, & honest. He was a spitfire to Caleb's calm patience, but even Caleb gave in eventually. I'm glad he did. From 'Whelp,' (Caleb's pet name for Wild for a while), to Wild, it was a good relationship & a good story.I've just recently discovered Zoe Perdita. She's not an auto-buy, but I've liked more of the few that I've read so far than not. I'll definitely continue to check out her stories. </p>

 <p> Zoe Perdita is one of the few writers who actually understand the difference between "upwind" and "downwind". Pardon the soapbox, but it has always been a pet peeve. I can't tell you how many paperbacks were tossed at the wall and discarded for that error. ( I have a kindle now, so have learned some restraint!)I don't understand Caleb's insistance on calling the Russian pack Eurasians, wouldn't they be Mongolians and not Russian? Unless he was being derisive and didn't believe they were Russian (Lowell? Really?)The characters are much more fully developed than the ones in the first, Wild certainly knows his own mind and is stubborn enough to stick it out.Caleb had his own issues to work out and finally did - okay, Wild might be a little pushy? stubborn?I did read the first Russian wolf pack novel, wasn't squicked out by the menage-a-(how many) but those characters didn't seem as fully fleshed out. Maby there were too many?All in all, I liked Wild and will happily wait for another book from Zoe Perdita </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Opposites Attract </p>

 <p> This is clearly a story of opposites attract.We have Caleb who has a dark past and Wild the young wolf who was kicked out of his Pack and forced to survive on his own. Wild feels a powerful connection to Caleb even though Caleb tries to push Wild away because he feels he is too young to understand his feelings. Needless to say, Wild doesn't give up easily.No one ever said the path of love was smooth but somethings (and people) are worth fighting for. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> I like the little omega wolf called Wild. </p>

 <p> Ok I admit I love my shifter stories featuring an alpha wolf hunk and a small but brave omega. This is what we have here. Wild the little omega wolf who was cast out of his pack when he was a mere thirteen years old whelp is very likable. He could have died but he managed to survive for 5 years as a wolf in the wild. Because of that he is independent and as wild as the name he called himself. I enjoy Wild's bonding with Caleb, the lone Alpha wolf. Wild's insistence to be claimed and Caleb's continual refusal certainly adds the right amount of angst to their relationship. Wild's juggling between life as a wolf and as a human is refreshing. I also enjoy when both guys were just being wolves. As I did not read the prequel (which features a menage and more, something I do not favor), there are background which is missing for me. But it did not deter my enjoyment of this story. There are parts which could have been tighter as a few times I have difficulty wondering who says what. Minor points I easily forgive for small publisher. As I do not favor flashbacks I would have preferred Caleb's old life not told in details that way. Fortunately the flashbacks are not many. Wild finally winning his Alpha certainly warms my heart, even if we expect it. </p>

 <p> This book sounds so so so good to me, I love me some paranormal m/m romance.  The plot/story line was good and the characters were well written and I love how you got to hear/read from both the main characters.  Wild I thought was awesome, he told you how he felt and never held anything back, even when he should have kept his mouth shut.  Though I just love how he was honest about what was going on and how he felt, put it all out there.  Caleb was a good character too, strong loner type but with a good heart.  With Caleb though there were too many LONG flash backs.  I like some back ground on the characters we're reading so we really get to know them, but geezz alittle too much with Caleb.  I kept thinking  to myself, &#34;ok ok we get it enough&#34;.  The pace of the relationship with these two was ssssooooooo ssslllloooowwwww.  I would have LOVED LOVED to see their relationship moved a little faster and for Caleb to get over his problem and embrace Wild.  It was a ok read for me I wouldnt read this again though. </p>

 <p> This novel started out good. It has a somewhat unique storyline, but by 80% (Book ended around 92% and went to excerpt for another book) I was bored with the Wild's whining because his mate wouldn't admit to the bond and take him already.  I could only stand so much of the drama. A good story, and fairly well written, but no great character development or twists to make it a riveting read </p>
