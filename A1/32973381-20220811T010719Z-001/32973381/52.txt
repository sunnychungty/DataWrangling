 <p> It's a power supply.  I use it to power a BeagleBone Black, and it has presented to issues.Buy with confidence. </p>

 <p> It fit well and provides plenty of power to my Beaglebone Black, connector fits well, and profile of the &#34;wall wart&#34; allows other devices to plug in next to it making it possible to use all the outlets in my surge protector at the same time. </p>

 <p> Solid, fits well, and has a good physical profile </p>

 <p> A week ago, myD-Link DGL-4300 Wireless 108G Gaming Routerjust died out of nowhere. Was working fine one moment, dead the next. Wouldn't power up, wouldn't do anything. I was about to throw it away and buy a new router when I decided to do some research and see if this was a common problem. Turns out it was. The power supply (adapter) is prone to going bad.  I ordered this one as a replacement, and as soon as I got it, found out that my router wasn't dead at all. Just the power supply. This thing works just fine and saved me quite a bit of money on buying a new router. Also, ordered on a Saturday, received Monday via free Prime shipping.  Couldn't be happier with such a cheap replacement. </p>

 <p> My power supply kept overheating and shutting down the print server. I Couldn't find a Linksys / Cisco replacement.  The power specs and this D-Link adapter are the same BUT you do have to cut the cord and connect the plug from the old dead Linksys adapter.  Has been working great! </p>

 <p> I use it on my Linksys PSUS4 print server </p>

 <p> I bought it because it looked similar and had the same voltage and amperage I needed... luckily it was the same everything I needed, it plugged right in and worked! </p>

 <p> My Wifi went dead and I checked the power supply and it had gone to IT's Reward.  This unit is an exact replacement and I was up and running as soon as I plugged it in.  Great product-exactly as advertised. </p>

 <p> It works well and has slightly higher amp rating than stock D-Link power supply.  I've been using these adapters for several DL 1522 bridge/APs. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> I purchased from GigaCity and was surprised to see I had a 3A AC adapter instead of the 2.5A one advertised here.  Though it was branded D-Link, it was slightly different (larger) than the 2.5A OEM adapter that failed on me.  I shrugged my shoulders and decided to give it a whirl.  I am VERY PLEASED NOW, the adapter works just as well as the old one.  I'm hoping the increased amperage means D-Link "fixed" something with this adapter and am also hoping it won't fail again.  It's been running like a champ for weeks now, so I am very thankful.  I wish the seller had disclosed upfront it was a 3A adapter but said it would still work, would have prevented that pre-trial anxiety.  I hope my review will rest the worries of anyone here who has a failed adapter on a DGL-4300 :)I saved tons of money over replacing the router, since I couldn't just buy a replacement but would've "upgraded." </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> NOT A 2.5A AC ADAPTER; however, it works! </p>

 <p> When my Hauppauge HD-DVR suddenly stopped working I went on-line to the forums where I learned that the power supplies are prone to failure. This item was the best-priced option and has 25% more power (2.5a) than the original (2.0a). Now the unit works like a new one! </p>

 <p> This item saved me quite a bit of money as D-Link's seem to have problems with the power supply going out and the wireless boxes are good.  Glad I read some of the blogs about this.  D-Link needs to find a better supplier of these power supplies. </p>

 <p> This little PSU adapter is working fine with BeagleBone Black board I ordered from Amazon.  It does not get hot and provides enough power for the board. </p>

 <p> I got this adapter to power a Beaglebone Black board. It requires a fairly steady 5 volts to run properly. When I plugged this adapter in, the power light was blinking off and on, and it wasn't doing anything else.When I put my multimeter to the power adapter I noticed that the voltage was fluctuating steadily between 4 and 5 volts like the ticking of a clock. It was identical to the blinking of the power LED on my board.For something with a more forgiving voltage requirement this may work fine, but if you plan to use it on anything that requires precise voltage, it won't work at all. I'd say to move on and look for a more reliable adapter either way. </p>

 <p> Does not keep a steady voltage </p>

 <p> like others have found. My powersupply that came with my D-Link suddenly died.  I checked it with a meter to find it was not producing any power.  This one is $4 less than the one form the same seller &#34;from D-link&#34; but seems to be identical to the one I originally had.  Powered right up and the internet is back! LOL </p>

 <p> Great price and saved me front trashing a perfectly good wireless router </p>

 <p> Well my D-Link switch's power adapter died a week ago so I ordered this little thing to replace it. It came quickly and it works, but it was so dirty! I don't know what it was, but there was some kind of ink substance all over the adapter head. My hands were all blue when I grabbed the thing to take a better look at it. </p>

 <p> In the past year I've had two HDHomeRun TV tuners abruptly stop working.  In both cases, the units powered up and were accessible using the HDHomeRun utility, but would not tune to a channel, leaving only a black screen when I attempted to make a recording.The problem was not the tuner itself, but instead a defective 5 VDC power adapter.  Checking the output voltage on an oscilloscope showed that the 5 VDC output had become quite noisy, probably due to a defective filter capacitor.  This adapter can be used as a direct replacement for the original Silicon Dust adapter.  The maximum current rating is higher than that of the original adapter, but that will cause no problems, and in fact is a plus in terms of durability.This adapter is inexpensive and compact, and it works perfectly.  Highly recommended if your HDHomeRun stops working out of warranty. </p>

 <p> A perfect replacement for a defective HDHomeRun adapter </p>
