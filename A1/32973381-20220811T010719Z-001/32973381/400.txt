 <p> After reading "Lucas" a while back, I was really looking forward to "Kane", specially because Kane's HEA was supposed to be with one of the villains from "Lucas"I loved the idea of the leading lady in this book being the bad guy in the one before. It was great finding out why Lara was so bent on killing the bothers and I have to say her story was very compelling and I couldn't help but understand her plea.Kane is a black cougar, which means that he is the assassin of the cougar clan. His latest job has been hunting the woman that tried to kill his brother and his mate, but what he can't understand is why his blood boils when he is close to her.Lara hell-bent on getting revenge on the people that killed her mother and nothing is getting her way, well, that is until she and Kane get together and the chemistry gets too be too much to be denied.I liked this book so much better than Lucas, one of the things that bothered me in the previous book was a certain lack of more explanation on how things worked in the cougar clan and better overview of the world Eliza Gayle created in general.In Kane we get to understand how things work in this world much better and I have to say that there is a lot of potential for great plots. The idea of a council that is set in its ways and of community members that start to question the status quo, is always interesting.I loved Kane and Lara together, they are perfect for each other and their chemistry was definitely sizzling. Their story was very well told and just in the right pace, seeing them change from enemies to mates was simply awesome!Kane just got me more excited about this series and I can't wait for the next and I believe last installment on the series coming out in June, Malcom. The only thing that bothered me in kane was that i wish it was a longer novel, i wanted more.Originally Posted at Welcome to Larissa's Bookish Life {larissaslife DOT com} </p>

 <p> Originally posted at: [...]Kane Gunn is the youngest brother of a family long seen as the final judgment for the Clans. Kane took over as enforcer when his brother Lucas found his mate and was banished for it. Now Kane must track the witch Lara, the woman who worked for one brother to capture and torture another.Lara is under an execution order for crimes against the clans, but she has her own agenda of revenge. Complicating everything is the very explicit dreams Kane has every night; dreams of Lara and himself making hot and passionate love everywhere.When Kane hears Lara's story, he begins to doubt the unquestioned obedience to the Clans his family has shown. There are secrets and it is time for all hidden agendas to be brought into the open. When Kane discovers Lara has a Black Cougar mating mark, he realizes she means more to him than duty. Can Lara put aside her hatred and move on? Will Kane prove that Lara was justified in her vendetta and get the death sentence overturned? Can they find out who is behind the subterfuge and stop it once and for all?This is the second Black Cougar novel by Eliza Gayle. I loved the character development in this one. Lara is not the evil witch we believed her to be from book one. There is a reason for what she has done, and she may have been justified in her actions. Lara is a strong woman, determined to have her revenge, or maybe it is justice she really seeks.Kane was sure of his mission, and as the last Gunn enforcer, he is all that his brother was: strong, handsome and powerful. But, unlike his brother Lucas, Kane is not happy as an enforcer, and questions the authority given and taken away by the council of the clans.I loved the mystery behind it all, and we get an idea about who is behind the trouble. The one thing in this book that I didn't care for was that there was no real solution: Lara still has much to find out about the past, and I can only hope that the loose ends left in this one will be tied up in another book soon. The world is one of shadowy motives and mysterious histories, but it is an intriguing book all in all. I loved the way the relationship between Lara and Kane grew, not sudden, but with give and take on both sides.If you can be satisfied with a happy for now, with more future action, this one is for you. </p>

 <p> This series is progressing at a very hot rate, each story gets hotter and hotter with a darker edge underneath trying to undermine the brothers. As those dark forces close in, somehow the good guys (cougars) win!! Loved this book, sexy, steamy and yummy </p>

 <p> Kane Gunn is the guardian of his clan and it is his job to enforce the laws put forth by the council. He is currently hunting the woman that attempted to kill his brother and his brother's mate. Kane has been stalking his pray for awhile and he thinks he's finally caught up to the slippery witch. Lara hates the cougar guardians. She blames them for the death of her mother and Lara is willing to do whatever it takes to get revenge against them. Adept in the black arts, Lara will attempt to bring the guardian hunting her to his knees. However, once in close proximity to each other they discover more lies between them. Lara is Kane's mate: How do you find love when so much hate lies in the way?Kane is the second book in the Black Cougar series. It's not absolutely necessary to read these in order. Kane and Lara share explosive chemistry. These two absolutely know how to set the sheets--or whatever--on fire. However, their hate was a giant hurdle to get over. I have read the first book in the series so I found it hard to get over Lara's previous duplicity. I have a very mixed reaction about Kane. I did enjoy the eroticism shared between Kane and Lara but I didn't feel the deep connection I wanted between them. Regardless of my iffy feelings toward Kane I do look forward to discovering more Black Cougars.MirandaFor Joyfully Reviewed </p>

 <p> Kane is the second Black Cougar novel by Eliza Gayle. The character development in this one is wonderful. Ms. Gayle shows the motivation for earlier actions, and we find that Lara is not the evil witch we believed her to be from book one. There is a reason for what she has done, and she may have been justified in her actions. Lara is a strong woman, determined to have her revenge, or maybe it is justice she really seeks. Kane was sure of his mission, and as the last Gunn enforcer, he is all that his brother was: strong, handsome and powerful. But, unlike his brother Lucas, Kane is not happy as an enforcer, and questions the authority given and taken away by the council of the clans.  He questions things, and doesn't accept all at face value. I loved the mystery behind it all, and we get an idea about who is behind the trouble. The one thing in this book that I didn't care for was that there was no real solution: Lara still has much to find out about the past. Ms. Gayle's Black Cougar world is one of shadowy motives and mysterious histories, but it is an intriguing book all in all. I loved the way the relationship between Lara and Kane grew, not sudden, but with give and take on both sides. If you can be satisfied with a happy for now, with more future action, this one is for you. </p>

 <p> Kane is the Guardian for this were-cougar clan and it's his duty to find and carry out the kill order for a witch who attacked his kind. But Lara has become more than an assignment for Kane. A desire burns in his body for her that threatens his mission for answers and justice. Lara has seen first hand the brutality were-cougars can cause and she will stop at nothing to get the revenge she craves. That is until Kane is sent after her and she too feels the spark of desire. A temporary truce is called but is then threatened when it becomes apparent Kane's clan is hiding a dark, deadly secret. One that someone will do anything to keep hidden.Kane respects Lara's strength and determination and decides to help her find out why a cougar killed her mother. Lara is not accustomed to having someone to depend on and is hesitant to rely on Kane. These two are weary of each other at first but are quick to jump into bed. Oh boy, what racy, primal, what I would do to be Lara scenes those were. This is a quick read so they become intimate quickly but I felt there was more to their relationship than sex. Even though Lara simply won't give in to Kane's demands, it's not so much a fight for dominance between these two as it was in the relationship in Lucas, but instead is about learning to forgive and accept. I wish more time would have been spent on what happened to and the clan's involvement in Lara's mom's death. It was a good story but it felt unfinished. Overall, I thought Kane had a great relationship between the main characters but the plot felt lacking. Still, Kane is a very steamy with well written characters and enough romance, sex, and drama to keep a fan of erotic paranormal romance happy. </p>
