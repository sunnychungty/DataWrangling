 <p> I picked up this book thinking that I had read this author before, unfortunately I realized soon enough that I had been thinking of Anthony Reynolds (who is actually quite good) and that this author was too be avoided in the future.The story started off decently enough, but soon was bogged down in the unbelievable rivalry between the three main characters. The circumstances of their anger at each other were forced and then the rest of the novel the reader is left to deal with the random outbursts of anger whenever the author decided you needed to be absolutely sure they hated one another.I am not sure why the other review says you get to see the training of space marines. You really don't, aside from a brief window into the pain fetish of the Imperial Fists. The initiates go from being winnowed through tasks the reader does not see to 4-5 years in the future when they are scouts. There is one training scene as scouts, then they are in the battle.In the end, there are plenty of better 40k books out there, avoid this one. </p>

 <p> I was ready for this book. AFter reading the action packed snippet 'tie-in' story in 'Heroes of the Space Marines'...which was so awesome. But after first few chapters it was clear that the book was not going anywhere. Repeat scenes and reworded text. It felt like I was skimming the surface and never really went into details of who the 'Imperial Fists' really are...their attitude and behavior. Reading this book felt like blowing smoke! Give me an Epic battle scene...of few holding out against Many. make it fast and deadly. Make it bloody. Bring out the character of who the Imperial fists really are. </p>

 <p> I'm adding a Warhammer 40K overview to this review to help newcomers get a sense for the Universe. (Warhammer 40K pros, go easy on me - I'm also somewhat of a newcomer to the Universe, hope I got the broad brushstrokes right). Review for book at bottom.HOW I GOT HOOKEDI got this through vine and put it directly on my nightstand. Although I've never gamed Warhammer (Warhammer 40k Space Marines Combat Squad) or any of their many other games, I became a fan of Warhammer 40,000 after a friend in college introduced me to the Warhammer 40k universe back in 1990 I want to say. While browsing through Amazon, I came across Eisenhorn probably the best "starter" novel to get anyone started into the Warhammer Universe. I have to admit, I've gotten hooked on the stories.THE BLACK LIBRARYFrom a company standpoint there is a British company called the Black Library that owns and manages Warhammer 40K. They have some great writers on staff like Dan Abnett and Graham McNiell who write many of the stories. The common thread of the writers is that in my opinion they are very literary people who manage the capture the dark, dystopian, almost opressing vision of this far future. Many of their stories have foundations and parallels in real world history...for example The Flight of the Eisenstein (Horus Heresy) is very similar in my opinion to The Battleship Potemkin. I think the company was founded in 1989 to provide advanced hobbyist game pieces (Games Workshop Space Marine Devastator Squad Box Set) that gamers could paint and decorate and then play in competition based on some rule books called codexes (Warhammer 40K (40,000) Codex Space Marines) very similar to dungeons and dragons.THE SERIESWarhammer 40K takes place about 40,000 years in the future in a neogothic dystopian Universe where the entire galaxy has been colonized. During the 40,000 year history humanity discovers that hyperspace (the mechanism they use to travel faster than light) is filled with ghostly demons and other lifeforms that will not hesitate to invade and infest the real universe. Add to that alien Elves, Orks, intergalactic insectoid invaders, parasites and every other conceivable menace, this makes for a tormented universe that only knows War and suffering for its untold trillions or quadrillions of denizens.In this Universe there is an Empire based on Earth with an Emperor and and a gigantic bureaucracy that manages the Imperium. I'll outline some of the story lines to help you make sense of this (if you're not a pro already):SPACE MARINES - Genetically and Cybernetically augmented warrior monks that form the front line of defense for the Empire. Space Marine novels generally build on the mythology of the space marines and generally describe a chapter of space marines (a monastery) and tell some story of how they fight for the Empire or how they fell from grace. Space Marines are almost not human, they've been augmented genetically stand at 8 to 12 feet tall and wear giant powered armour. They fight in space and in some horrible conditions. For this reason, you don't get much of a feel for the denizens of the Empire (generally) in these novels. Space Marines are Monks and celibate (I think) so you don't get any flavor for interpersonal relationships. Although in a few stories you do get some political intrigue and in one space wolf novel, you even get to see Earth. Expect lots of fighting with these novels in very novel settings.The Ultramarines Omnibus (Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)TITANS - The giant Mechwarriors (giant walking two legged tanks) that form the heaviest of assault machines of the empire. Titanicus is the only Warhammer 40K novel that I know of that is based on Titans. Because Titans stand at 40 stories and are crewed by a very select group of very religious people, you don't get much of the flavor for the citizens of the Empire although you do get dazzling descriptions of the cities, planets, and how the war machines fight. Expect lots of fighting with these novels.Titanicus (Warhammer 40,000)IMPERIAL GUARD - The Army of the Empire (untold billions serve and die regularly) -- CADIAN BLOOD is an Imperial guard novel. Expect down and dirty grunt fighting and warfare in these novels with a healthy does of intrigue and plot machinations. Because Imperial Guard are human, you get more of a sense for the Empire than you do with Titan or Space Marine novels.Cadian Blood (Imperial Guard)INQUISITORS - The Emperor's inquisition carries the Empire's complete support as they go out and seek out evil in any form (Einsenhorn, Ravenor, and Innocence Proves Nothing are Inquisition novels). Expect more intrigue and deceipt in these novels and expect to see some of the more opulent aspects of the Empire because many times Inquisitors walk among the citizens of the Empire. I find that I get a better flavor for the Warhammer Universe from Inquisitor Novels. They are my personal favorites.Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)Ravenor: The Omnibus (Warhammer 40000)Innocence Proves Nothing (Warhammer 40000)MECHANICUM - The Mechanicum is almost like a pseudoreligion based on Mars who has a very close alliance with the Emperor (although sometimes you wonder). The Mechanicum makes most of the technology for the Empire. So many things have been invented and forgotten in the 40K universe that technology is more of technomagic and technology use is almost ritual-like.Mechanicum (Horus Heresy)HORUS HERESY NOVELS - When the Warhammer 40K Universe was invented (mostly for gaming purposes), a backstory was developed that tells how the Galaxy was brought under the Emperor. It used to be a fairly short story but has been expanded broadly now that Warhammer 40K is so popular. Here are some Heresy books in no particular order but there is an order (there are too many of them for me to track and I haven't read them all).Horus Rising (The Horus Heresy)The Flight of the Eisenstein (Horus Heresy)False Gods: The Heresy Takes Root (The Horus Heresy)SONS OF DORNIf you're a Space Marine tabletop player and if you're an Imperial Fists player, then this book is going to be almost required reading.  I will say that the author is very very detailed in his description of battle scenes and battles and in detailing out the comraderie between the different characters.  I'm halfway through this book right now and I can say that it's very action packed from a battle standpoint.  It also does cover the mythos of the brotherhood (battlemonk) kind of world these people live in.  In addition, I will say that I like the writing, it was polished and artistic -- something that's not always found in some of these books: it's got pizzazz..Now, I'm just a half-Warhammer 40K fan so to me -- the story told here did have some parallels to Space Wolf.  It has elements of how Imperial Fists Space Marines are indoctrinated into the program, the specifics about their geneseed and how it's different from others --- all those elements are there.  Given that I now have a general knowledge of how Space Marines come to be, that aspect was a bit repetitive but if you're an Imperial Fists guy --- I think you'll need to read this to get the background and detail, and there is quite a bit of detail here.  If I had read this book first though and then read Space Wolf, I'd be saying the sae thing about Space Wolf.  The overlap makes sense though because all of the chapters have their idiosyncracies that need to be explained especially to the true hobbyist that has an army of these guys.Overall, some reviewers have knocked this book but to me, I thought it was a great showing and the writing was more polished than what I expected.Just be aware, this book is about Space Marines duking it out, shooting, more shooting, slashing with swords, etc.  If you come here looking for inquisitorial writing or stuff like that, you're not going to find that level of intrigue although there is some.  Read it enjoy, there are some also some nuggets buried here about the Imperium that are worth knowing.This is a Warhammer 40K book so it takes place in the 41st millenium, just FYI. </p>

 <p> Sons of Dorn may has well have been titled Imperial Fists, in homage to Space Wolf, the book that it is basically a portmanteau of. The first half of the book is the identical story of several characters who wish each other dead going through the initiation and initial Space Marine training. In place of the Cup of Wulfen and the icy peaks of the Fang, you have the pain glove and the Phalanx. What makes this rather tragic is how the book could've been rather good, especially given how teetering to the edge several of the characters become.Through together a few macros on superhuman strength and stamina, a few on how power armor could've stopped X, but scout armor could not, and a few on fighting through pain, and you have about an additional 15% of the text of the book. In addition, SM's are supposed to be superhuman, and this portrayal paints them as the pinnacle of human, but only just. I prefer the comparison of a punch from me could snap your spine to I'm only slightly better than you. The enemies taken on in this volume, despite being amped up, should've still been felled like sheep at the slaughter, as that's what SM's do.Overall, a mediocre plot foiled by making it something that you've clearly seen before, and while this seemed to be one of the few moments where the Imps can claim a clear and decisive victory, priceless jewels for their rarity, it sure did not have the feel of a win. The tension and animosity that seemed like it would be a driving force of the story sputters and dies, with no apparent cause or reason for its departure. Read Space Wolf instead, better plot with better character closure. </p>

 <p> ...and Sons Of Dorn gives us the Imperial Fists.  For me one of the most imaginative parts of 40k are the differences between Chapters and any new info I can get of any Chapters is always a plus.  Great, albeit standard 40k fare, that will satisfy any Space Marine fan.  Lets hope Black Library will give us more books about the many different Space Marine Chapters that have never been the main theme before. </p>

 <p> Taelos yearns to be granted permission to embark on a warrior pilgrimage, spending the rest of his life hunting down and destroying any and all enemies of the Imperium. Instead, Chapter Master Vladimir Pugh gives him the command of the Imperial Fists 10th Company and Captain Taelos leads a recruitment mission to scour the nearby systems for suitable aspirants (between the ages of ten and fourteen).Jean-Robur du Queste, Zatori Zan, and Taloc s'Tonan are in battle, on opposing sides, when the Adeptus Astartes land and wade into their raging war. Zatori has seen Jean-Robur kill his master from behind and craves vengeance. Taloc is after Zatori for almost the same reason. But when they are culled and among the chosen, they must set aside their blood-debts (at least until they can kill each other without dire penalties).The three aspirants must endure rigorous training with their peers. Out of thousands, a fraction will go on to become neophytes. After four years, only the best are left to become scouts. The three rivals join their Imperial Fists battle brothers in action on the planet Vernalis, against the Roaring Blades Traitor Guard. But more is going on than meets the eye, and soon it seems that the Traitor Guard will end the hate triangle once-and-for-all.**** FOUR STARS! This is the first of what appears to be a new series. In this story, I watched as the reasons for the hatred between the three occurs, they are chosen, they survive to become Astartes in all but name and one more needed surgical implant, and then on to the Vernalis mission. Rarely are readers given the treat of watching the selection of new recruits, much less of their training years. The author has done an impeccable job showing the process. I believe this to be a strong foundation upon which Chris Roberson can build a fantastic series. I look forward to the next installment. ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews. </p>

 <p> In _Sons of Dorn_, Roberson almost seems to be trying to do too much. The prologou introduces us to Captain Taelos, an Imperial Fist Space Marine who feels he has disgraced himself. Rather than be allowed to pursue his quest of redemption, he is tasked with finding and training new recruits to replenish the Imperial Fists' ranks. His journey takes him to Triandr, a world divided into warring factions. Two of these factions have met for battle on an island controlled by the third. Each of these three peoples has a youth among them who has to prove himself by the sword in the battle being fought. In their pursuit, one dishonors the second, who in turn dishonors the third. Thus, two of them have sworn blood oaths to kill the others, while the first one is ignorant of his transgression. All three are found suitable to become Space Marines and are taken aboard the Imperial Fists' ship.While all three and many others are put through their paces in their indoctrination, the two with blood oaths plot to kill their targets. They know they must bide their time, due to the unforgivable nature of the crime of killing a fellow Space Marine. Several years pass and the recruits have been whittled down to a handful. Their Space Marine commanders order the Scout unit to a planet invaded by Chaos. Finding their sworn enemies already gone, the bulk of the Imperial Fists leave in pursuit, leaving behind the Scout unit and Captain Taelos. But did the forces of Chaos truly leave?The story starts out dreadfully slowly, as the three Scout characters are introduced. Stretching the bounds of credulity a bit, all three must perform the same action to be recognized as men. All three encounter one another in some manner on the battlefield. All three unite to stand against the Space Marine recruiting team. All three are found suitable candidates and taken aboard. All three succeed in the various trials and become Scouts, with two withstanding their drives for vengeance. As the training progresses and the action on the invaded planet begins, we get some of the action typical of 40K books, in that the Space Marines fight against the forces of Chaos. As typical, the Marines are vastly outnumbered and rely upon their superior training and equipment to survive. But the constant switching between the three Scouts, as well as Captain Taelos and various others as needed to advance the plot, begins to feel disjointed. While the prologue would seem to suggest that Captain Taelos is the protagonist, the succeeding Parts replace him with the three Scouts, only occasionally returning to Taelos as time passes. While it picks up significantly about halfway through, it's a tough slog to get there. I think the book is a decent read after that point, but the slow start takes down the rating in my view. </p>

 <p> In the Warhammer 40k universe Space Marines are superhuman warriors fanatically loyal to the Emperor.  This makes them great for wargames but hard to write in novels since there's little to tell them apart.  Sons of Dorn tries to breath some life into marines by following three initiates as they are grabbed off their primitive world and molded into Space Marines.  The result is a strong start but then a very predictable story.It starts strong introducing 3 mortal enemies from 3 different cultures.  The Imperial Fist Space Marine chapter descends upon their world and literally pulls them off the battlefield as potential recruits.  In the trials that follow the recruits are whittled down from thousands to just a few dozen. The marines are cruel and unfeeling, unworthy recruits are disposable.But once our 3 heroes become marine scouts (the lowest rank) things become dull and predictable.  There's a desperate battle against hopeless odds where despite foolish tactics the marines prevail.  The potentially interesting subplot of their continuing hatred towards one another is referred to but never amounts to anything.As for the climactic battle, Chris Roberson simply fails to create a compelling scene.  After spending most of the book praising the Imperial Fists for their skill at siege warfare he has them make several foolish choices.  They send away most of their force and all of their air support.  They defend a vital gate with only 3 men armed with short ranged flamers rather than heavy bolters.  They miss obvious hints that some of their charges cannot be trusted.So this book is readable but what should be the climax is very disappointing. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> This is a story that follows three young men who are selected to become scouts in the Imperial Fists chapter of the Space Marines.  The story begins following each one individually on their homeworld.  The novel spends a bit too much time focusing on this part of the characters lives.  There are several overlapping sections where the book just feels repetitive, telling and retelling the same events from the different perspectives of each of the main characters.  Once the three are selected to become Scouts, the book becomes a bit more interesting if you are a fan of Space Marines.  It goes into some fairly good detail about the process of becoming a Space Marine Scout; the genetic altering, the ritualized teachings and psychic screenings.  Again, there are parts that feel quite slow, as it takes quite a while before the recruits are allowed to take part in any battles.  Once the Scouts are finally pitted against their enemy, a large army of Slaanesh cultist Imperial Guardsmen, the book begins to pick up somewhat.  Still there are many times when the book seems to be repeatedly covering the same information again and again which gets quite tedious.I would recommend this book to a Warhammer 40,000 fan who is interested in the Imperial Fists, but moreso for those interested in Scouts.  In the long run the book feels more like it could really be about any Scout in any Space Marine Chapter, going into very little detail about the rich potential stories of the Imperial Fists Chapter. Special Imperial Fists Character Captain Lysander does make a brief appearance in the book, but really isn't much of a factor.All in all the book is an average read which could have been drastically improved by simply being shorter.  It seems like there is a great deal of repetition which makes the book read quite slowly at time and gets quite frustrating.  So, in short, only read this book if you are really a big fan of Space Marine Scouts. </p>

 <p> This is a below average Warhammer 40K story from a new author.  The plot is thin and seems forced.  The conflict triangle between the three main characters gets old.  There are some good fight scenes at the end of the book when the scouts hold out against a hoard of enemy. But it seems far fetched, even for a 40K novel, that a handful of scouts and two space marines could hold off a battalion of chaos marines, infantry and daemons.There is little development or insight into the Imperial Fists space marine chapter founded by Dorn.  I wish that there was more character development so that I could get to know any of the three main characters.  I wanted more background information about the Imperial Fists.  The writing is not up to par with Abnett, McNeil, or Counter novels. </p>

 <p> Ok, so this book has or had a lot of potential.  You start to get to see inside the Asartes training process.  You start to see the indoctrinations of potential candidates.  The problem is the book is boring and hard the follow.  The author has this annoying habit, of the describing a scene 3 different ways, from the viewpoint of the 3 main characters.  This gets old, very very fast.  In most cases, the additional viewpoints are 95 percent the same.  So its like reading the same paragraph over again 3 times.  I'm sure in Author's head this seemed like a way cool idea, but in practice, at least for writing, its cluedgy and bores the reader.I would avoid this book. </p>

 <p> SONS OF DORN is another great addition to the Warhammer 40,000 genre, and I must admit that I am rapidly becoming hooked (this is my fourth WH40K for Vine).  Author Chris Roberson sets up a fast-moving, action packed storyline that combines hardcore sci-fi combat with some interesting and well-thought interpersonal drama to deliver an entertaining, easy read that leaves the reader both satisfied and looking for the sequel.Brought together for their first combat actions, three human youths from three different warring factions stand ready to do battle in their respective armies on the shores of the insignificant isle of Eokaroe.  Each is looking to the coming conflict for different reasons, but all with the naivete of youth.  As the battle is joined and the slaughter begins, each experiences the horror of combat in their own way, and as the action builds to a critical point, each personally plays a role in the others' significant pain and loss during the battle, generating thoughts of vengeance and blood-debts unpaid.The action comes to a crashing halt when a recruiting mission of the Imperial Fists chapter of Space Marines arrive right in the middle of the battle, and three dissimilar youths find themselves faciing a brother-Captain in full power armor.  The three, along with thousands of other youths who have survived thus far, are recruited into the chapter in hopes of one day becoming full battle-brothers.  Of those thousands, barely a dozen will make it even to Scout, let alone battle-brother, but along the way these three persevere, and learn more about themselves and each other than they thought possible.  Still, beneath the discipline of being an aspiring Astartes, their thoughts of revenge against each other still seethe.Two things about this book made it particularly enjoyable for me.  First, it gave some background into what it takes to be a Space Marine, which filled in my knowledge gaps considering this was only my fourth sojourn into the WH40K world.  Second, Roberson does a masterful job of telling an exciting military story, and weaves the interpersonal relationships between the three neophytes into it in a way that enhances the story, rather than seem like a forced hanger-on.Roberson is obviously a masterful storyteller, and I look forward to additions in this series from him.  Highly recommended for fans of WH20K who particularly enjoy the Space Marine storylines of the genre. </p>

 <p> Warhammer 40,000 novels may not be masterful examples of the written word, but there are always a few satisfying elements that are going to come part and parcel with any story set in that universe.  All those elements are clearly present in "Sons of Dorn."  Tales of honor and the corruption of chaos, camaraderie between Space Marines, and of course, page after page of explosions, severed limbs, and flying bullets.Anyone new to the universe of Warhammer 40,000 won't get lost, as everything is explained while the story moves along.  That's a bit of a double edged sword though, because people who have already read many other novels in the line and regularly play the miniature combat game may find the descriptions overly tedious.The story deals with three new scouts recruited into the Imperial Fists chapter, who all come from different warring factions in the middle of a battle.  The back story of each character and their reasons for fighting against each other before being forced to work together makes for good reading, although no one should expect to develop much of a connection with any of them.  From their initiation and subsequent training, the three would-be Space Marines are then tasked with defending an isolated world from an incursion by the forces of chaos.Whether it was a page count limit or a conscious decision by the author, for some reason none of the various storylines have any sort of strong resolution.  The lack of a definite wrap up to the various story threads gives the book a "snapshot" feel, as though it's just a single clip in a vaster overall movie taking place in the Imperium of Man."Sons of Dorn" isn't the best Warhammer 40,000 has to offer, but it does have all the elements that make up a decent sci-fi story and enough action to keep things exciting. </p>
