 <p> While there was no final outcome, and there should have been, to properly end this series,  there were still some great episodes here. Samurai vs. Samurai was a funny episode in which Jack must deal with a crude rude upstart who has far more braggadocio than he does skill. The Scotsman again returns to discover Jack has run afoul of something nasty enough to wipe his mind and he takes an unwilling Jack on a journey to get his mind back in a wonderful two part episode that is something of a take off on &#34;Star Wars&#34;. There is again plenty of &#34;Star Wars&#34;-like action where we hear what sounds like Jeff Daniels of C-3PO fame, taking on the role of Chitron-6, a robot belonging to a prince and princess on an urgent mission to save their world when they fall afoul of Aku. There is also a funny mano y mano fight between Aku and Jack as Jack forces him to fight on his level and a flash back story to a younger time while Jack trained in Africa. The very last, Jack and the baby, dealt with a baby held captive for dinner by trolls and his efforts to return him to his mother. While this season was good, it wasn't really finished, and I wished it could have been, because I'm sure it would have been spectacular. </p>

I will watch this dozens of times more and never tire...  If you are a fan of any sort of action or anime, pick this up!!  Truly one of the best of all time. </p>

 <p> Genndy Tartakovsky's "Samurai Jack" is one of the most fantastically inventive shows to ever grace TV. Amidst the stunning action sequences, and the almost star wars-like creatures, are good morals. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, and makes you laugh, sometimes at the same time. This show is a sure fire treat for animation buffs to casual TV watchers. It deserves a spot in the animation hall of fame (if there is one). </p>

 <p> don't know why amazon still has samurai jack listed as "pre-order"  It's Aug. 22 and I got Samurai Jack, season 4 at Hastings today.  Great animation!!!  Assigned to us by our animation teacher as an example of how great imagination and a good story always beats out high tech 2 and 3-D animation any day.  Doesn't matter how old you are you will enjoy these stories.  If you like Samurai Jack, check out Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends...done by staff related to SJ.  Also check out the beautiful art and story-telling in the comic books by Stan Sakai, Usagi Yojimbo....the samurai bunny....similar themes of honorable self-effacing samurai helping the downtrodden. </p>

 <p> We watched Samurai Jack as a family and loved it. We'd come to the tv when the new episode was coming on - we couldn't wait to see it. I think my husband and I loved the artwork the most in this show - we'd be so amazed at how beautiful the art and colors were. We had great fun watching Samurai Jack together.Season 4, the last Season - we tried to catch all the episodes on tv and were very sad that the very last episode did not allow us to see Jack getting home. The series didn't seem to have a polish to it near the end. We were really very disappointed that we were just left hanging at the end, that episode being like any other episode in the series, in where you're still hoping for him to get home and you have no satisfaction of finality either.Regardless of this disappointing detail, this series, the show, the story,  the writers, the illustrators, and the creator gets 5 stars from us!  We're very happy to own the entire series. Thank you for putting it out on DVD for us.Side note: We loved Mako's voice as Aku, and when we started watching Avatar: The Last Airbender, we realized right away that Uncle Iroh and Aku's voice were the same. Through this we learned a little about Mako and his life, and truly enjoyed his voice-acting work in these two of our favorite animated series. </p>

 <p> We own all four seasons of Samurai Jack, the unarguably best animated cartoon produced in a long time.The background art is awesome as is the soundtrack, Genndy Tartakovsky had a great hero with Jack, we wish he was still out there fighting Aku! Aside from the episode where Jack loses his mind and briefly becomes a Valley Boy, it's all good."Whatchaa!" </p>

 <p> Unpredictable.  Illogical.  Impossible.  He is THE ONE!  Samurai Jack--defender of truth, freedom, and talking dogs--is back for a fourth and final season of futuristic hacking and slashing.  Set 4's two discs come in a cardboard slipcase, tastefully decorated in a gold honeycomb pattern with Aku's hideous likeness prominently featured on the front (unless your fold-out disc-holder is upside-down and backwards, as mine was).  Disc 2 includes a nice selection of extras like promos, deleted scenes, and a very interesting visit with the show's creators entitled, `Genndy's Roundtable.'Among these thirteen stellar episodes is the hilarious two-parter, `The Scotsman Saves Jack,' in which we meet a goofy guy in a red jacket by the name of Brent Worthington, who just happens to look exactly like Jack.  In episode XLII, Jack encounters a hip-hoppin', jive-talkin' "Sam-u-rai," and teaches him that, "You can never defeat another if you know not how to defeat yourself."In XLI, Jack traverses the devastated streets of Andromeda and is attacked by the awesome Mondo-bot.  The frightened robotic Andromedan citizens lead the wandering samurai warrior to a Gundam-like mobile suit and Jack attacks the Mondo-bot Voltron style.Episode XLIII begins with yet another battle with the fiendish Aku.  But this time, Aku calls the fight off early because he's afflicted with a nasty cold virus.  Unfortunately, before leaving, the shape-shifting villain coughs up a piece of himself...a piece which Jack accidentally swallows!  Our hero is slowly but surely possessed by the evil black spirit of all-enshrouding Akuness, and so he must travel to the watery temple of the lizard-monks for help.XLVII is an obvious homage to 'Star Wars,' featuring the butterfly-like Prince Astor and Princess Verbina of Alepidopterans.  The insectoid siblings (along with their golden assistant, Chitron 6) are relentlessly pursued by Squoomian gunships as they leave their home on Chrysalis to search for their royal navy.  They crash-land in Samurai Jack's world and are quickly captured by Aku's demonic minions.Episode L introduces an emotional robot hit man in a black trench coat and wingtip shoes who's pining for his little lost dog, Lulu, a.k.a. "sweet thing."  The merciless Aku is holding Lulu hostage in order to coax her mechanized owner out of retirement.  Aku wants Samurai Jack terminated, and the twin pistol-wielding dog-lover is more than willing to do the job...as soon as the rain stops.So, at long last, all of Jack's adventures are available on DVD.  But, it is a bit disappointing to learn that, like `Lost in Space,' this spectacular series does not have a satisfactory finale.  Genndy Tartakovsky says there might be a Samurai Jack movie someday.  Let's hope that day comes very soon.  In the meantime, the screaming baby episode will have to do. </p>

 <p> This season is really good. It wasn't as good as SJ Season 3, but still a-lot more entertaining than most cartoons out these days. Everything is about the same as the previous seasons, but it has some really good episodes , like "The Aku Infection," "Scotsman Saves Jack, Part 1& 2," "Jack versus Aku," and "The Four Seasons of Death" This is the final season of SJ, and it's really good. I love how they  have the stand out episodes in each season, such as this one it is "The Four Seasons of Death" More cinema sequences, and more detailed in art and the way it looks. This is really a great show, and I wish their was more shows that were this creative and awesome to watch. If you liked this I recommend checking out the "Star Wars: Clone Wars" mini-series that was on CN, It was done by the same person who made this (Genndy Tartakovsky, or however you spell it ha) Especially if you're a SW Fan.Anyways, I'm glad I spent the money on all four seasons of SJ, definitely one of the best animations in a LONG TIME! 5/5 Stars. </p>

If you don't know JACK...SAMURAI JACK, that is, is the story of a young samurai warrior seeks to defeat the evil shape-shifting master of darkness, Aku who has destroyed his father's kingdom and imprisoned its people.

Beautifully animated, the series makes you feel as if you are looking a high-action, high-color woodcut prints, scored with music both modern and ancient, both electric and serene. Featuring the voice work and the incredible depth of feeling from Phil LaMarr as Jack, and brilliance of Mako as Aku.This set includes episodes 40 through 52 as released in the season 4 setNOTE: IF YOU DON'T ALREADY OWN ANY JACK on DVD, YOU MAY WANT TO GET THE Samurai Jack SEASON 1-3 SET WHICH WILL (OBVIOUSLY) INCLUDEs DVDS (#1-39), BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO WANT THEM ALL, I PROMISE!Gokouun o inorimasu </p>

 <p> I am a 36 year old father who got into Samurai Jack through his son.  I will admit that I am a big kid and love animation, but I am also picky and don't have time to waste on sub-par series.  Samurai Jack is certainly a cut above most.  From its offbeat theme song and stylized animation, you know you are getting something special -- and that isn't even taking into account the premise of the shows!  My son even wanted to be called Jack for a several months, and has been inspired to learn the art of the samurai sword in his Tae Kwon Do class.  All because of this series.I missed most of Season 4 because of Cartoon Network's constant shifting of the show.  I am not sure why it did not go on for another few seasons as it was always fresh and exciting.  It is one of the few shows that really miss being able to see.  We have the other 3 seasons on DVD and they were well worth the purchase price.  Excellent stories, high flying action, and great characters make Samurai Jack a cartoon for the ages.  I expect the Season 4 DVD will continue to live up to those high standards.EDIT:  Got the DVDs and have been watching them with my kids.  Yep, it was worth the wait.  It is fun to catch a few of the episodes I missed.  Some have said the quality of the show dropped in season 4 -- I could not disagree more! </p>

 <p> Stay for the crab cakes!  The fourth season of Samurai Jack is as good as the third season, which is as good as the second season, which was as good as first season.  The humor, the tons of action, the thrills.  Let us face the facts - the Samurai Jack series is one of the best cartoons to come out of an American studio for a very long time.  And it will be missed.  The artwork, the storytelling, the characters, the feel that it was made with lots of love and lots of intelligence.  And what ever happened to Lulu?  And can you remember all the lines taken from Star Wars?Also, don't forget the extras such as deleted scenes and a few features with Genndy.  Even the Samurai Jack promos were cool to watch.Waiting for the promised movie! </p>

 <p> Samurai Jack comes to a close, which is a real shame.  This show should've gotten another season, at the very least.  But they saved some of the best stories for last.40.  Samurai vs. Ninja:  Aku sends a ninja to destroy Jack.  This is a great episode through & through, but last fight sequence is so spectacular that it would've been worth watching just for that.  A+41.  Robo- Samurai vs. Mondo-Bot:  Jack helps protect a city inhabited by robots by piloting a robo-samurai to battle the threatening Mondo-Bot.  I love Japanese giant robot anime (Voltron, Robotech, macron 1 & more) so naturally I love this homage.  A+42.  Samurai vs. Samurai:  A cool samurai punk wants to battle with Jack in order to prove that he is the best.  A very funny episode.  A43.  The Aku Infection:  Aku sneezes on Jack, & Jack slowly becomes infected with Aku's evil.  The scariest episode of the whole series.  A+44.  The Princess and the Bounty Hunters:  When Aku raises the bounty on Jack, the best bounty hunters in the world gather to capture him.  Despite the fact that Jack is barely in this episode and doesn't say anything, this is still an awesome episode.  A+45-46.  The Scotsman Saves Jack:  Jack has lost all memory of who he is, and it's up to the Scotsman to put the pieces of the puzzle together by sailing straight into the perils of the Great Unknown.  I just realized one of the shortcomings of season 3: no Scotsman!  They make up for that though, with a double dose that's just as good as the previous ones with him.  A+47.  Jack and the Flying Prince and Princess:  Jack helps save a prince and princess whose ship has been shot down to Earth.  This is the worst episode of the season.  The Star Wars homages are good, but Jack seems out of character here, not helping the kids when he had a chance.  Still, it had a good opening & a good ending, so I shouldn't be too hard on it.  C48.  Jack VS Aku:  Tired of all his bounty hunters and robots failing, Aku fights Jack, mano-a-mano.  This sort of plot has been done before, but never as good as this.  A49.  Seasons of Death:  As Jack journeys through summer, fall, winter and spring, he must battle the perils each season brings.  This a very unique episode.  A+50.  The Tale of X49:  Aku forces an old, ace robot out of retirement to eliminate the ultimate mark - Jack.  This is my other favorite of the Jack-lite episodes.  A+51.  Young jack In Africa:  Young Jack is brought to Africa for part of his training, but when his tribe is abducted, practice quickly becomes a battle of life and death.  Now THIS is how you do a prequel episode.  Jack's training would have actually made a great season 5.  A+52.  Jack & the Baby:  Jack finds a baby and the two travel together as Jack tries to return the boy to his mother.  This is the second worst episode of the season.  Don't get me wrong, it's pretty good, but not what I would've wanted in a final episode.  Still, I won't complain since it could have been much worse (a clip show, for instance).  B+When only 2 episodes are below A, you now it's a great set.  No ending, but hey we'll get that when the movie is made, whenever that is.  Maybe if you go & buy all the seasons the movie will finally see the light of day.  So what are you waiting for?  Buy all of these.  You won't regret it. </p>

 <p> Great ending season. Best episode, in my opinion was Four Seasons of Death. Second best would be The Bounty Hunters, where I believe, it was the first that had Jack kill things that weren't robots. Like all seasons, it has it's A, B, C episodes. The most notable one is Jack VS Aku. Very disappointing, especially after how marvelous the fights were in the last season. Still, great fun to watch. Complete your collection with this and you won't regret it. </p>

 <p> My only regret is that there was no ending Aku is still at large and Jack still searches for a way back home. It would have been nice to finish the series with an ending with a slight hint Aku could still escape. But with great series there is usually a movie......Well hope so for on many movies there is a conclusion and it would be nice for Jack to finally go home to his time. But in the last disc there is some commentary on the new work they are up to and nothing indicates a Samurai Jack movie. But you never know maybe they will read this and think it would be nice to have a movie. Lets just hope so..... </p>

 <p> A show like this comes along once a decade. Genndy and his team really hit their stride in the last 2 seasons. Episodes like the 4 Seasons of Death and Tale of X9 were masterpieces. The settings are beautiful. Jack isn't some static character, he is evolving, learning, becoming better and better. His relationship with Aku likewise evolves. There is so much thought put into Samurai Jack. Even if it isn't your cup of tea, you have to appreciate the effort put into it and how great it looks. This will forever be one of my favorite shows. </p>

 <p> Like the previous three seasons, Season 4 of Samurai Jack is very rewarding on many levels. The stories continue to be clever and well written...occasionally even touching and profound. The show's design is superb and evidently well-regarded in the animation industry. You can see the influence of Samurai Jack in the opening credits of the feature animated film Kung Fu Panda from Dreamworks. Series creator Genndy Tartakovsky has done a great deal to raise the bar for quality in TV cartoons. I've read that he's currently occupied storyboarding the next installment of Iron Man while simultaneously working on an updated version of Jim Henson's Dark Crystal. I'm eagerly anticipating both projects. </p>

 <p> You knew this day would come eventually.  It's the fourth, and sadly last, season of one of the greatest action series that has ever graced the airwaves of Cartoon Network: Samurai Jack.  The series created by Genndy Tartakofsky (Of Clone Wars and Dexter's Lab fame) may have reached its end, but Jack's quest still continues nonetheless.  As long as he has his powerful sword and his vengeance toward Aku, the story will never end.And now, here's my very last top five episodes from season four.  Here goes.5. "Jack and the Baby" - Jack discovers a infant boy and takes the child along with him.  Now he must find the baby's mother and fast.4. "Jack and the Four Seasons of Death" - Jack faces the dangers of winter, spring, summer, and autumn.  And by dangers I mean the perils that each season spawns.3. "The Aku Infection" - An unwell Aku sneezes on Jack and pretty soon, Aku's evil has taken over Jack's body.2. "The Scotsman Saves Jack" (parts 1 & 2) - The Scotsman, one of Jack's allies, attempts to rescue Jack who has lost his memory.  After rescuing his friend, the Scotsman and the Samurai challenge each other to see who's the best.1. "Jack vs. Aku" - It's the ultimate showdown as Jack and Aku go one-on-one with each other.Honorable mention: "Robo-Samurai vs. Mondo-Bot" - Jack has been proclaimed the "Chosen One" in a new city.  He then enters the body of the Robo-Samurai and attempts to defeat the evil Mondo-Bot destroying the city.Don't forget to check out a couple of special features which include a commentary with the creators of the show and exclusive promos plus never-before-seen footage.Well, they say that all good things must come to an end.  And a series as good as Samurai Jack might as well end, too.  Jack's adventures still continue in Cartoon Network Action Pack comic books, but those won't compare to the brilliant award-winning series that won the hearts of many viewers.  (And as weird as it seems, there was an episode of "Duck Dodgers" that was totally inspired by this series.)Either way, have faith in the Samurai.  No matter what. </p>
