<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Very Practical and Immediately Applicable </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Author, Mary Kelly, PhD has made a unique and valuable contribution to the study and practice of leadership with this book, "Master Your World, Ten Dog Inspired Leadership Lessons."I've long believed that training and experience in parenting are extremely valuable for managers. However, since I haven't had a pet since I was about 16 years old (a pair of horses), the notion of applying animal training principles to managing humans had not occurred to me.Kelly is a retired commander in the U.S. Navy who taught economics and management at the U.S. Naval Academy for 21 years. She also trains dogs and horses and is currently the coach and officer in charge of the equestrian team at the U.S. Air Force Academy. In "Master Your World" she has distilled her experience in training animals and military cadets into a practical, how-to guide for managers.She makes the management principles memorable by using examples of animal behavior. For example, if you have dog as a pet, does it respond better to a scolding voice, or a to a cheerful voice combined with a dog treat or dog toy? No one who has experience with dogs would expect to consistently illicit desired behaviors from a dog thru scolding. The thought rings as silly as pounding one's head on the wall. Why, then, do managers and parents often scold, criticize, and provide "feedback", to people and expect better results? Perhaps because humans are "smarter"? If humans are smarter, they are likely to tolerate those behaviors less, not more, than dogs. Kelly uses these examples from animal training to indelibly make her points.However, lest you think Kelly has little experience applying these principles as a manager of humans, remember that as a commander in the U.S. Navy, she has managed military organizations of hundreds of people, such as the Barbers Point Naval Air Station security department where she was essentially the chief of police. She also taught thousands of Navy and Air Force cadets. That experience is what apparently drove Kelly to make this book extremely practical and immediately applicable to on-the-job situations.As with all good business books, this book should be read a little bit at a time, so the reader can apply the principles one-at-a-time. This is a very useful book that should not just be read and then forgotten. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> A book surprisingly more effective than it's cute analogy </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Using the dog analogy throughout the book, writer Mary Kelly creates and executes scenarios of people management, both as a boss and an employee, that demonstrate how an effective and fulfilled social unit performs. I found myself in agreement when she pointed out how to do things from an employee perspective. Anyone who spends time around dogs understands the alpha position isn't exactly the most desirable one. The alpha dog often seems to wonder how he got the job. That aligned me with Mary Kelly as leadership is often about following subordinates, and letting them tell you when to duck. Get this book. It has very insightful, if playful lessons. </p>

 <p> It's such a great read,that I've read it 3 times.Being a canine lover makes me love this book even more. Unless you are completely closed off to self-improvement, it is impossible to read this book and not have some major perspective-shift in the days after. Thanks to this book, I have found myself to be more productive & I have gotten better with managing tasks at work. I am really glad that I came across this. One of my top ten favorite books. Highly recommended to everyone. </p>

 <p> The cover of this book immediately caught my attention as a dog owner. I became more and more engrossed with each chapter as I found Dr. Mary Kelly's views on leadership really resonated with me. Having recently been promoted to a management position within a small but growing business, Master Your World was exactly what I needed to get in the right frame of mind to lead and motivate my team.Unlike so many dry, tedious books on leadership, Master Your World has a humor that keeps the pages turning. By the end of the book I felt prepared to handle the responsibilities my new role entitled. I am now able to show appreciation and motivate my team in a way that will not only boost their performance and productivity but also increase their happiness as well. In addition, I feel like I now have the confidence of a public speaker when meeting with my team.All in all, Master Your World is a must read for anyone interested in productive leadership! </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Very enjoyable reading that any dog-owner can relate to!  More importantly, these lessons apply not just to leaders, but in dealing with others in everyday life.  Although I am no longer in a management position, I believe that these lessons will help me in dealing with clients in my day job, and other volunteers in my committee roles.  Mary's approach is very practical and hands-on which appeals to me much more than the typical leadership philosophy books out there.  I sat down and wrote a "thank you" note the same day I finished the book!  Thank you, Mary, for giving us these terrific life lessons. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I loved this book.  Learning leadership skills is not exactly the easiest thing to do and so many books on the subject are dry and hard to put in practical terms.  But, Mary has done something brilliant with Master Your World.  With my Avon business, I need to learn leadership skills, but in order to learn, I need to be able to relate to the material.  Nothing appeals to me more than dogs, and I understand dogs.  So, I felt certain that this book was going to teach me a great deal about leadership.  It most certainly did.  Not only is it very educational, but it is also very entertaining.Now, you don't have to be a dog lover to appreciate the leadership lessons in Master Your World.  Mary has just simplified the concept of leadership and put it in terms that anyone can not only understand, but put into everyday business practice.  Drawing parallels with dogs and how they learn from their "packs", human and canine, makes it possible to learn practical leadership skills that we can put to use in our professional lives.  I highly recommend Master Your World whether you own an Avon business or you are a CEO of a major corporation.  Mary is a fantastic teacher and I have learned so much from her already, but I will turn back to this book often as my business grows.  I must continue to learn and grow along with it. </p>

 <p> Mary Kelly is a master of motivation.At first, you might be put off by the comparison between team members and dogs...but don't let that stop you! Mary has a wonderful sense of humor and makes a compelling case for leading productive teams in a way that really works. Beyond the great content, it's clear from the examples that the author has truly lived what she shares.If you're a leader who's frustrated at your team, I highly recommend Mary Kelly's book. You won't regret it (even if you've never been a dog person.)David Dye, author ofThe Seven Things Your Team Needs to Hear You Say </p>
