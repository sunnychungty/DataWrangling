 <p> I wanted something I could play music off my phone or laptop with that had decent sound.  For the price you cant beat the sound on this little package. It is NOT a $1000+ sound system but it does sound a lot better than those little one speaker Bluetooth units. Very happy with purchase. Only complaint I have is that using the Bluetooth and streaming from my phone the sound occasionally cuts out for one second. The company has been great with customer support and even replaced the original unit in case it was faulty, </p>

 <p> M2 Bluetooth 2.1 Speaker system by Kinivo put out great sound and looks great as well. This speaker system is a great way to take the music from your cell phone and fill your music with music. This speaker system gives you 360-degree sound.  It connected to my HTC One X in seconds.  This speaker can also connect to your device through the 3.5mm aux jack included with the speaker system.The M2 Bluetooth 2.1 speaker system is designed for computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones, iPod, iPhone, iPad and Android devices.  The speaker system's Subwoofer and 2 Satellite Speakers puts out amazing sound.  This product is better than advertised.  I am definitely glad I have this product and would definitely recommend it to others.Thank you for reading my review.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation. </p>

 <p> I have used a couple different Bluetooth speakers but nothing as big as this set. The Kinivo M2 Bluetooth 2.1 Speaker System includes all of the following.Subwoofer2 Satellite SpeakersRCA to 3.5 Stereo Audio CableUser GuideThe subwoofer is also the control panel and the satellite speakers connect to it. There is a large gold knob on the front that controls the volume and it's illuminated by an LED light. I like the LED light because it gives it a nice touch and makes it easier to find in the dark. The subwoofer is on the side and is protected by a mesh cover. On the back you will find treble and bass adjustments and RCA connections for audio in and audio out. You will also find the power switch, source button and Bluetooth pairing button.The satellite speakers have several areas of gold trim that match the gold knob on the subwoofer. You can sit the satellite speakers flat or you can angle it like a diamond. If you angle them like a diamond there is a nice pad that will keep them from sliding around. There is also a screw hole on the back if you wish to hang them on the wall.Setup was a piece of cake. Remove from the box, plug in the power cord and connect the satellite speakers. I use Bluetooth to wirelessly send music from my iPad to this speaker system. First I needed to sync the Bluetooth on the speaker system with my iPad. It was simple and it worked the first time. I simply had to hit the pair button on the back of the subwoofer and then connect with my iPad. I haven't lost the connection so far so it has worked perfectly. It seems to have a range of about 25 feet before the siginal starts to break up.Visually I think this speaker system is pretty impressive. I like the look and it seems to be well made. Most importantly it sounds very good. It has 56 watts of power total has a surprising amount of bass. The high treble sounds especially good to me. The only thing I would have liked to have seen is a built-in FM stereo. I think that would have come in handy.Sure you can find a better sounding system but overall this system is a great choice. I think it's priced very fairly for all that you get and the quality and sound quality of this system. If money is no object than why not go for the most expensive system. I personally am someone that researches every major purchase and the pricing as well. Before I will make a purchase I have to convince myself that it's a good product, good value and I am getting the best possible deal on it. I think this system qualifies in all of those areas and I am comfortable recommending this system.Sample provided for review. </p>

 <p> This is an incredible speaker system!  It comes with two satellite speakers and one subwoofer.  The design is very visually-pleasing as well as well-constructed.  It comes with an included audio cable to connect to a standard headphone-type jack but the Bluetooth connectivity is what really makes this sound system shine in my opinion!  It enables the speakers to be placed out of the way without a wire and communicate wirelessly via Bluetooth with an iPad, iPhone, laptop, desktop computer, etc.  I use mine in conjunction with an Apple iMac and it works great!  This would also be a great system for someone that typically only uses their device's internal speakers but wants to crank out tunes via speakers placed elsewhere for parties, etc.  The subwoofer contains a volume knob, as well as knobs to adjust treble and bass.  Pairing with another device could not have been easier!  To makes things better, the speakers are all powered by a single power cable, so there is no need to replace batteries, etc.  You can find more pictures of this amazing sound system here http://goo.gl/XZqNec  This truly is an incredible sound system for an affordable price. </p>

 <p> Now that's what I'm talking about! These little suckers really rock! Bluetooth works flawlessly with all of my devices between cell phones and tablets the sound is incredibly good for such a small unit. Overall is this unit really is great for a premium sounding desktop unit or to fill the middle of your main floor with sound I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a pint size stereo system with a big stereo system sound! </p>

 <p> Thank you Kinivo for providing me with an M2 Bluetooth 2.1 Speaker, free of charge, for review. These are my own honest opinions.I love music, and I love listing to loud music. When it comes to speakers and headphones, I have quite a few, but my Kinivo products are my favorite! I have been very impressed with Kinivo's ability to make affordable audio products with such high quality sound. I've tried out a few of their products now, and even their $20 speakers sound amazing!As you can imagine, I was super excited to receive their M2 Bluetooth 2.1 Speaker for review. This speaker includes a pretty large subwoofer, along with two satellite speakers.I set it up at my desk, intending to use it mainly with my laptop, but I use it with my phone quite a bit as well. The subwoofer fit under my desk, and I put the two satellite speakers on either side of my laptop. This speaker system will blow you away with it's amazing sound quality and volume! I cranked up the bass, cranked up the volume, and it felt like it was shaking my whole room!There is a volume control on one side of the subwoofer, and controls on the back for power, pairing, source (auxiliary or Bluetooth), bass, and treble. There are audio outputs for the two satellite speakers, which are wired with included cords. There are also audio inputs and an included cable to use with non-Bluetooth devices. I'm using that right now for my laptop, but plan to get a Bluetooth adapter for my laptop soon.The sound quality using this speaker system with my iPhone really blew me away, whether using it with Bluetooth or plugged into my headphone jack. When I hooked it up to my laptop it isn't quite as good, but still pretty nice. I've figured out this is a problem with my laptop sound quality, and not the speaker. Even though my laptop has Beats audio which I configured, it is nowhere near as good as the sound quality of an iPhone with the bass booster feature turned on in the equalizer settings. I haven't tried it plugged into a TV yet, but I can imagine that would be pretty good as well.Out of all my speakers, this one really takes the cake! It is my new favorite Bluetooth speaker, and that is even comparing it to another $300 Bluetooth speaker I own! </p>

 <p> Speaker sound is awesome via bluetooth from my macbook. Pair it once and it'll automatically pair after that when you turn on your computer or wake it up from sleep.The bright light from the sub is kind of annoying. They do have a very faint buzzing noise when no sound is being transmitted, you have to get pretty close to the speakers to hear it. I don't know if it's caused from interference or just how it is, hopefully it doesn't turn out to be a problem in the future. </p>

 <p> I had a nice Harmon Kardon 2.1 that the sub gave out on so it was time to get a new sound system for my desktop computer.  The speakers provide clear and focused audio with plenty of power and headroom, though they speakers can be overdriven and distort at high volumes.  I listen primarily to music while I work and am very picky about musical quality. I wouldn't rely on this small package to fill a large room with music or watch an action movie with lots of explosions, but it's perfect for a mid-sized room.  One thing that stands out is how the &#34;center&#34; channel sounds travel depending on how the balance is set.  The speakers are about four feet apart on my desk, but the vocals seem to come directly from the center of my desk.  As I moved the balance setting, the focal point of the vocals moved.  The only negatives about this system is the woefully too short connecting cables for the satellite speakers, that it defaults to Bluetooth when the power is cycled and that most of the controls are on the back of the sub.  .  Because the speakers connect with RCA plugs, that means getting an RCA coupler to have the sub on the floor under my desk.  The price is very reasonable, though not cheap.  I clearly got what I paid for and more based on other speakers I've purchased. I can't speak about their reliability as I only got them yesterday.  Hopefully it will last a long time.  I would not hesitate to purchase another set or recommend them if they prove reliable. </p>

 <p> I will start this off by saying that I love this speaker system, and many of my friends were very impressed with it. My friends and I all have very similar taste in music but when we all sat outside I didn't have a way to listen to music but I wanted something simple and this filled that role easily and some. I had planned on only really using it outside at first but it was so simple to use and easy to move around I found myself just moving it all over around the house.Pairing my phone with the system was very simple and paired up instantly, the sound was far louder then I was expecting and never found myself wishing I could make it louder but actually lowering it which is a good thing. It might look small but surely packs a punch which is why my friends were so impressed because of it's size, it's not small but it's not big either. The sub is also more then ample for what I needed especially at this price point. The sub actually put out closely to what my speaker set up for my pc does and those are far more expensive. Since I had just moved I actually ended up using this in place of setting up my speakers for some time because it was just so much easier. </p>

 <p> For what you pay for vs quality this product is a #Bang4YourBuck and that's an under statement. Don't expect this speaker system to blow you away but rather amaze you for what its worth. I like it and I think you would too. What I really like about the Kinivo is that it had bluetooth so you could connect with your ipad, labtop, ect. while it's connected to your computer. Awesome! </p>
