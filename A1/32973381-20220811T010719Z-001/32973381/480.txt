 <p> Had high hopes for this book, but alas, it seems to not contain a lot of creative ideas. I think the title is very misleading; however, there are some decent, but very simple budgeting ideas such as:&#8226; Setting Goals and Timelines for meeting your goals&#8226; Pay off debts with higher interest rate&#8226; Use online financial calculators&#8226; Shop around for health insurance&#8226; Don't shop hungry&#8226; Be diligent to avoid bank feesNothing wrong with any of the ideas above--but they hardly qualify as &#34;Robbing&#34; the credit card company.Chapter 10 is entitled, &#34;HOW TO LEGALLY ROB CREDIT CARD COMPANIES.&#34;  Aha! I thought this is where the really creative ideas would lie. I read this chapter over and over to make sure I wasn't missing anything. Alas, that chapter can be boiled down to these few points:&#8226; Do not work with debt settlement companies&#8226; Tell the creditor you will pay the creditor first who agrees to a settlement of your debt&#8226; Try to negotiate a debt settlementThat's about it. The entire meat of the book is in 2 pages, with just a few simplistic points.&#8730; Some useful information on avoiding debt, budgeting, etc.  But nothing very impressive. There are far better books available. </p>

 <p> In this book, the author talks about budgeting, types of bad debts, How to pay off your credit cards, How to manage your bills, and other vital financial information. I would say this is needed to survive the financial crisis facing most Americans. </p>

 <p> I was forced into debt in 2014 after my wife suffered a debilitating condition, causing her to lose her job and our financial independence.  My credit score was severely damaged.  It was a financial crisis and damage control was necessary.  The situation literally trapped my family, as my income dipped while expenses rose exponentially.  How to Legally Rob Credit-Card Companies opened my eyes, I believed it was impossible to effectively deal with bill collectors while recovering my credit score.  I quickly learned that bad credit could make or break your financial future.This guiding light helped me to overcome and attain financial freedom through debt consolidation services.  Gerry Marrs recommendations offered me an alternative to the turmoil created by bankruptcy, bad debt, and late payments to improve my credit score.The book served, as my personal credit advocate, to educate me while offering a logical solution.  It alleviated my stress while I regained financial security.  If you find yourself swimming in an ocean full of bad credit, reach for this lifesaver.  I steadily recovered my original credit score after a few months with assistance from the book.  You can achieve a similar result with patience.  Thanks Mr. Marrs! </p>

 <p> I gave this book a 4 because it didn't have anything new for me to try.  The information is sound and parts of it have worked for me in the past. We are in our mid 70's and have a traumatically brain damaged son we are care taking.  Having exhausted all our resources we have medical bills now piling up.  I have gotten us out of debt a number of times in the past using these remedies but emergencies keep occurring.  Would  love to be debt free again. </p>

 <p> The author is completely practical, real, comprehensible, and furthermore, he speaks with true integrity. I am already doing most of what it says. Very practical book. Very helpful, and filled with ideas to bring spending under control. I wasn't expecting much from an e-book but how wrong I was! I wish everyone would read this book whilst young and use it as a financial compass. there are a lot of gems in this book. it did inspire me with new ideas. There are so many things that you can do to save money and help others that you never really would think about doing yourself.Easy to understand ! We think everyone would get something from this reading. I would like to thank the author for sharing his wisdom in such a generous fashion. so many good ideas to help save money. Would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to retire some day! I got thrilled with this book when I started reading it and one by one I got acquainted with a lot new ideas for becoming debt free. I loved that l could read it on kindle. Once I started reading it, I couldn't stop. This will help a great deal of people with financial growth. </p>
