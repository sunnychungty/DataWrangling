 <p> Don't let the flimsy box deter you from picking up this bargain set of the Criterion Collection versions of four films by one of the best directors in cinema history.  Japan's Akira Kurosawa was influenced by John Ford and other directors, and in turn influenced the work of George Lucas, Stephen Spielberg and many others.  Kurosawa used techniques and shots that are still used and, as a true auteur, his vision can be felt in every scene.  The four films here are all samurai films and all star Toshiro Mifune, a national treasure of Japan and a real joy to watch.SEVEN SAMURAI tells the story of a village of desperate farmers who hire the samurai to defend them from a horde of roving bandits.  Mifune as Kikuchiyo, the clownish and crazy misfit, and  Ko Kimura as Katsushiro, the new samurai just learning his trade, experience the most change in the film.  The 1988 commentary track by Michael Jeck is just wonderful; we learn a lot about Kurosawa, Mifune, the actors and techniques, and other films, as we listen to it.THE HIDDEN FORTRESS tells the story of a princess and her protector as they move through enemy territory and encounter two bumbling thieves.  An eight-minute featurette shows George Lucas talking about Kurosawa in general and this picture, in particular, as influencing Star Wars.  YOJIMBO and SANJURO tell the story of a samurai who means well as everything around him seems to go wrong.All four are heard in Japanese with optional English subtitles.  The Criterion Collection treatment, as usual, results in crisp, clean prints with great soundtracks.  All four films are accompanied by their trailers, and in the case of SANJURO, that includes tantalising bits of behind-the-scenes footage.This set may not be worthwhile if you already own two or three of the Criterion versions, but if you have pre-Criterion prints you want to replace, or if you only have one, this would be very worthwhile for you.  Wonderful prints of four great films by an amazing director. </p>

 <p> Purchasing a Kurosawa movie released on DVD by Criterion Collection is always an easy decision, despite the price. This Box Set brings together four of Kurosawa's best Samurai movies, all featuring Toshiro Mifune, in one box and at a reduced price no less.Without a doubt, the jewel of this collection is "Seven Samurai", often cited as one of the best movies of all time. Blending action, comedy, and hard hitting drama, this movie is a pure masterpiece. This is the most complete Criterion release, with commentary and flawless restoration of both picture and sound. One disappointment, though. The running time of this version is listed as 203 minutes, while other prints from Criterion run at 207 minutes. The perfectionist in me always goes for the full version.Next up is the masterpiece "Hidden Fortress", one of the many inspirations for Star Wars (the two bumbling peasants are what influenced the characters C-3PO and R2D2). Having seen this film many times, and in many formats, this is by far the best. This version is completely restored, with a new and improved translation and better subtitles. Also included is a George Lucas interview, in which he discusses to what extent her was inflenced by Kurosawa.Also included for good measure is the two part Samurai saga "Yojimbo" and "Sanjuro", in which Mifune plays a rogue Samurai who has a knack for getting mixed up with the wrong people while trying to do the right thing. Both are a pefect mix of action, comedy, and drama. Both DVDs are newly translated, with flawless subtitles and picture quality. The sound on Yojimbo does crackle a bit here and there, but it's barely noticeable. Both come with theatrical trailers, and "Sanjuro" comes with some behind the scenes footage which is interesting, but too short.Kurosawa movies are always a pleasure to watch, and I love how Criterion takes the time to produce top quality prints for movie lovers (like myself) to collect. This box set is a wise purchase for someone who is new to Kurosawa (you get his best movies, basically), as well as someone who is mroe than familiar with his work. But for someone who already owns these Criterion DVDs separately, it is not worth getting. Nothing special above and beyond the DVDs themselves is included, unless you count the box. But no movie collection is complete without ample Kurosawa. </p>

 <p> I was thinking about purchasing all four of these movies, but to have them together in a box set is a beautiful thing.I will not bore you with the reviews of these movies, those who love Akira Kurosawa movies sees the stories closely matching those of Shakespeare, a Clint Eastwood Western, and Star Wars.For the price and what you get, it's a steal. </p>

 <p> AKIRA KUROSAWA - 4 SAMURAI CLASSICS is the definitive cinema collector's set, containing four of the most significant films by one of the world's greatest and most influential filmmakers. Each of these films feature the venerable Toshiro Mifune, Japan's greatest actor, who worked with Kurosawa in one of the most productive actor-director collaborations ever seen. These films set standards of excellence which have been emulated by directors since, from George Lucas to Francis Ford Coppola. In terms of cinematic brilliance, engaging plots, and phenomenal value, this set is unparalleled.The crowning piece of this collection is Kurosawa's magnum opus, THE SEVEN SAMURAI, hailed by critics worldwide as one of the greatest films ever made. This film's fascinating storyline is centered on a poor village that seeks help from seven samurai, who nobly defend the farmers against a gang of marauding bandits. This film has been imitated -but never equaled- throughout the years by films such as The Magnificent Seven and A Bug's Life. Spectacular cinematography, profound philosophy, engaging character development and rip-snorting battle scenes make this an unforgettable movie experience.THE HIDDEN FORTRESS is widely known for influencing George Lucas' in his development of Star Wars. Both films involve a princess who must be taken to safety through hostile lands, and have two bumbling characters who provide the viewer with perspective -and belly-busting laughs- throughout the film. But that is as far as the similarities go; The Hidden Fortress remains superior in its blend of breathtaking action, wry humor, and compassion for humanity.YOJIMBO is one of Kurosawa's darkest films; it portrays a ronin's intrigue and guile against feuding gangs in a corrupt and lawless village. Brutal violence and black humor make this a stunning film; it was imitated in a Fist Full of Dollars and Last Man Standing. SANJURO is the follow-up to Yojimbo's story; the ronin must help nine young samurai save their uncle from a corrupt official. This film is as brutal as its predecessor, yet lighthearted and humorous.All four cinematic milestones are available individually from Criterion, but now one can purchase these classics at half the price though this collector's set. Perhaps the only films missing are RASHOMON, the first great Kurosawa classic, and RAN, one of his last achievements. This is an offer no true lover of cinema can pass. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! </p>

 <p> THE DEFINITIVE KUROSAWA COLLECTION </p>

 <p> Action movies like Akira Kurosawa's are a rarity. They have stories, and the action revolves around that; there's nothing used for shock, but they manage to hit you in the gut anyway. Each film in this collection of &quot;Samurai Classics&quot; is vivid, compelling, often humorous and stars the fantastic Toshiro Mifune.&quot;Seven Samurai&quot; is the now-classic tale of an impoverished country village, which is regularly pillaged by bandits. Desperate to protect themselves, the villagers send out some young men to hire samurai to help them. What they get is a ragtag but willing band, led by a weary veteran and including an eager-puppy teen, a seeming nutcase (the predecessor of Captain Jack Sparrow?), and basically anyone who will fight for a square meal.&quot;Hidden Fortress&quot; was one of the shaping influences on George Lucas's &quot;Star Wars.&quot; In it, a general (Toshiro Mifune) and a princess are attempting to sneak across a border. The problem is, they are being helped by a pair of greedy, not-too-bright farmers (Kamatari Fujiawara and Minoru Chiaki), who bumble as often as they assist.&quot;Yojimbo&quot; was an adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's &quot;Red Harvest,&quot; the story of a detective who cleans up a city. This darkly humorous film introduces a wandering samurai-for-hire (Toshiro Mifune again), who stumbles onto a war between two clans. He's smarter than just about everyone else in the film, and so he begins playing both sides, deftly avoiding disaster as he deals with the clan war in his own way.&quot;Sanjuro&quot; is probably the lightest of all Kurosawa's movies. The scruffy, wily hero of &quot;Yojimbo&quot; (Toshiro Mifune yet again) returns, this time taking nine naive, inept young noblemen under his wing. They have to somehow rescue the Chamberlain, his wife and young daughter from the Superintendent -- assuming that &quot;Sanjuro's&quot; army of nine doesn't botch it all up.Kurosawa's filmmaking is not flawless. For example, when people are cut down in battle they have a tendency not to bleed (or they bleed too much). However, for form it can't be beaten. Battle scenes have a flash-bang intensity, or the slow, building pressure of duels. There's also early slow-motion effects, as demonstrated in &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; during a one-on-one fight.Kurosawa was a lover of American cowboy flicks, and at times this shows, especially in the rugged hero of &quot;Yojimbo&quot; and &quot;Sanjuro,&quot; who acts like a medieval Japanese gunslinger (he even has the piercing eyes for it). But first and foremost, these are stories -- no more and no less. Kurosawa's storytelling ability is laced with drama, humor, and all this without meandering or preaching.For any rabid cinephile, Kurosawa's films are a must. Epic action movies with plenty of swords, mayhem and grizzled heroes don't come any better than these. </p>

 <p> That's right, these ARE some of the greatest Japanese films ever made and are especially wonderful samurai movies!By now you know abouth the movies that are included so let me make some technical reference to the DVDs.In terms of picture quality, Seven Samurai has been restored to present the best presentation of the film to date.  Yojimbo features a fine 2.35:1 non-anamorphic transfer of the film.  Don't get me wrong, it is quite good, especially for a film of its age, but you won't be writing home about it.  Sanjuro (my favorite of the bunch) is presented in a non-anamorphic 2.35:1 aspect ratio and starts off poor.  The film looks worn for the first few minutes and shapes up after that.  Overall, a very good transfer.  Hidden Fortress has the best picture of the bunch, having been mastered from a pristine interpositive to a high definition transfer!Sound on the disc is as follows: Seven Samurai features a restored mono track and is a improvement over the old video tape I used to watch!  Yojimbo's sound isn't quite as good.  There's a hiss throughout the Japanese 2.0 Mono track.  To sum it up, it is fair.  Sanjuro, happily, doesn't have the hiss present in the Yojimbo track.  It is a pleasant Japanese 1.0 mono track.  Hidden Fortress gives the viewer the choice of a 1.0 mono track or a 3.0 Dolby Digital track.Extras?  Seven Samurai features audio commentary by Japanese film historian Michael Jeck which offers insights into Kurosawa's work, the film and Japanese culture which combine to make a highly engaging commentary.  Also included is a theatrical trailer.  Yojimbo is pretty much a bare bones disc, including only the trailer and liner notes.  Sanjuro has the same features as Yojimbo.  Theatrical trailer and liner notes.  Hidden Fortress includes a theatrical trailer and an eight minute interview with George Lucas who discusses Kurosawa's influence on him as a filmmaker.In conclusion, these are excellent films with presentations that I'm sure are the best we will ever see for them.  Don't hesitate to add these to your film library! </p>

 <p> Kurosawa is not just considered a great japanese director - he's considered one of the best the world has known.Samurai are a passion for me anyway - however,  kurosawa brings them to life like no other.I sometimes wish he were working today with the technology available, but it's not a degradation of what he did at all.Details he pays attention to are easily missed the first time around and frequent watchings of these films with bring more to your eyes.Yojimbo's first encounter with the blackgards and braggarts - the wanted men in the town,  is ingenius and thrilling. Mifune plays the part so comfortably you can be lead to imagine he lived in his kimono.His demeanor is so casual and calm that you could fear him just through his confidence.It's something to take to heart. No real warrior needs to brag, nor does he threaten.Right out of the Tao te ching.Awright enough of that!With the hidden fortress you can really see Luca's inspiration for Star Wars. And also, the female lead for every anime ever created afterward.but my favorite is the seven samurai later to be remade as the magnificient seven in the west (what is it with the west and their inability to accept foreign films?).the old samurai who in the opening sequence plays a monk to rescue a trapped woman gives you the personality of a man who puts all at risk for the right. And teaches a motley band of characters to do the same.Every good fortress needs a weakness. :pENJOY </p>

 <p> This is must buy for fans of Samurai cinema. Kurosawa was the master of his artform, and these classics prove that traditional action can hold its own against today's CGI fighting.  NOT coincidentally, each one of these movies have been remade at least once, taking their basic stories and placing them in different times and places.  One of them, Hidden Fortress, was even remade to tell the tale a long time ago, in a galaxy far away.  There would be no Star Wars without these films, as Lucas lifted many a scene from these films. </p>

 <p> This is a great set to own - 4 of Kurosawa's great films in one reasonably-priced box set.  Criterion does a great job with the bonus stuff, and quality of film transfer.  The sound on these is mono, so there's not much more tweaking that Criterion could have done in that department.My biggest qualm is that 2 of the 4 films are not Anamorphic.  Those of you who have widescreen tvs will know what I'm talking about.  YOJIMBO and SANJURO, both 2.35:1, are not presented with an Anamorphic (or &quot;enhanced for widescreen TVs&quot;) option.HIDDEN FORTRESS is Anamorphic.SEVEN SAMURAI is 1.33:1 standard format, so it will appear &quot;square&quot; anyway.I was very disappointed to discover this after I bought the set.  I understand that Criterion is now trying to release their titles in Anamorphic format.  However, I wonder if they'll ever go back and re-release YOJIMBO and SANJURO this way? </p>

 <p> Nothing new in this set, merely the existing Kurosawa period flicks packaged together in a flimsy box.  It is a convenient way to pick up these four fantastic movies.  Each one is an absolute jewel.Criterion treats Kurosawa right, and they have been improving with each DVD release.  Seven Samurai, Sanjuro and Yojimbo are so of the earliest releases, so they do not benefit from increased experience.  I believe Seven Samurai is actually number 2 in the Criterion Collection.  The DVDs are fairly bare boned, with little or no extras.  Seven Samurai has a great commentary, worth the listen.  Hidden Fortress is a little better off, having an introduction by George Lucas.All in all, this is a great package.  if you don't already own them, go for it!  You won't be disappointed. </p>
