<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Wonderful characters, emotionally satisfying journey </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I just loved The Girls Club! It was a carefully plotted, naturally unfolding coming-of-age tale about a Northeast working class family. With the central character as a smart, funny, questioning young woman, incidents swirl, emotions bubble up and the tale takes you on a terrific ride. Penned with poignant honesty and lyrical writing, The Girls Club has universal appeal. As a publisher myself, it makes me wish Sally Bellerose was ensconced in my writer's stable! Looking forward to a second novel soon! </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This is the story of Cora Rose, whom we first meet as a working class, Catholic teenager with a confusing lesbian attraction to her best friend, and who has a somewhat dysfunctional relationship with her two sisters, Marie and Renee.  Cora Rose ages and matures into young adulthood in subsequent parts of the book, reluctantly dealing with her lesbian attractions, but painfully shy because of a physical ailment (ulcerative colitis, which she and her sisters always referred to as "dreaded bowel disease".  Her knowledge of what it means to be a lesbian comes initially from what she reads in advice columns, or hears from her sisters, until she discovers a local lesbian bar, The Girls Club, of which she is initially afraid, until she experiences the alternative "family" of women she meets there. The rest of the novel is essentially a late "coming of age" tale, as she deals with her feelings as well as her evolving relationship with her sisters, who have problems of their own.Well written, and painfully realistic in its "warts and all" approach to Cora Rose's life, this award-winning novel (which reads more like a memoir, although it is a work of fiction) about sisterhood and growing up is a gem, and much recommended.  Five stars out of five.- Bob LindEcho Magazine </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> The Girls Club: A Book Review </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> The Girls Club by Sally Bellerose centers upon three sisters, Marie, Renee, and Cora Rose, teenagers on the cusp of womanhood who are fighting to find their way in the world and out of the projects. Guiding their way is a strong Catholic upbringing and a large, ever-present extended family. As they grow from girls to women each one goes through a painful and beautiful journey where they learn to love themselves and their sisters even if they don't agree with them. The Girls Club capture truth about sisterhood: you may sometimes hate your sister but you will always love her, even when it is hard.Each sister is beautifully crafted and interesting to get to know. Marie, the eldest is head strong, belligerent and rebelling against her Catholic faith. She drinks, smokes, and screws around. She is regarded with terror and awe by her peers, teachers, parents, and sisters. A powerful raging force, she is humbled by the news that she is pregnant. After the father of the baby, Fletcher, offers to pay an abortion she turns back to Catholicism for strength and her sisters for support. After Marie's son Donny is born she is constantly wrestling with trying to do the right thing for Donny while still feeding her wild impulses. Eventually, she finds a stable partner for herself, gives up drugs and alcohol and comes to a tepid peace with Catholicism. Marie is a tour de force, whose journey into womanhood is a brutal, violent, gut wrenching transformation.The middle sister, Renee, is graceful, beautiful, and serene. She is the type of girl everybody loves and is irritatingly put together. She decides to go to nursing school and get out of the projects. She tries to support her sisters,  she glosses over their flaws, and doesn't look down them when they make choices that disagree with her world view. Renee presents a portrait of an easy, happy transition into womanhood. Her life is the ideal that most little girls dream about attaining. Renee is simultaneously a woman you want to be and a woman you loathe because she makes everything look effortless. Renee is often the butt of everyone's jokes for being so virginal and nice. She is also the one that the reader and he sister's wish they could emulate.Cora Rose, the youngest sister is the main protagonist of The Girls Club. She is 14 at the beginning of the novel and we follow her journey from a reserved, wayward teen to her mid twenties when she finally accepts and is comfortable with who she is. Central to Cora Rose;s story are three main forces: her budding sexuality, her faith, and her ulcerative colitis (coined The Dreaded Bowel Disease by her sisters). Cora Rose struggles with what it means to be beautiful, her embarrassment over having a The Dreaded Bowel Disease, and with her feelings of sexual attraction toward other girls. Since Cora Rose is not as blunt as Marie, or as serene as Renee she has to find her own path to being self-assured. Unfortunately, after her first love moves away and she is left with a broken heart, Cora Rose tries to bury her shame and fear by having sex with the first boy who seems interested. She becomes pregnant and eventually marries the father of her baby even though she has no real feelings for him. Most of the book describes how she breaks away from her marriage and accepts the challenges of living with ulcerative colitis. As she grows up, she realizes she can't hide her sexuality and begins going to a lesbian bar called The Girls Club. By the end of the book, Cora Rose has made a tentative peace with her demons; carved out her own identity; learned to love her sisters and not judge her self according to their standards.The Girls Club is frustratingly happy read. It captures the angst and heart of what it means to love yourself and love your sisters. It is about finding peace with the darkness in your life. </p>

 <p> A beautiful, literary novel.Hands down a terrific book.  I read a lot of fiction this last year and The Girls Club is a novel you want to recommend this year and 50 years from now. Sally Bellerose is obviously someone who has been crafting her words, her stories, her characters - seriously, thoroughly  and wonderfully for a long time.The story resonates so truly and deeply. Like Cora Rose, I too come from a Catholic family where I was one of three daughters growing up in the 1960s & 70s.This is a keeper </p>

 <p> I liked this. It is definitely excellent writing. I don't mean to sound surprised, but there's so much mediocre stuff out there. This has a lot going on and sure made me glad I wasn't aware of my sexuality sooner. This time period was not an easy one to come out into. The relationship among the three sisters was very well done--says someone with no sisters. It made me think of my wife's sisters and my cousins, all have this kind of complicated love/hate vibe going on. I thought the setting, Chicopee, Mass., could have been a bit more vivid. Could have been just about any working-class town. The end didn't go quite where I'd hoped, but it was satisfying. I wonder if the theme of guts was intentional. It sure was fitting. Cora Rose lost her guts, but she sure gained some. This is not a Romance, just so you know. It is a very good, literate novel about being a lesbian. Very nice. </p>

 <p> I'd read an excerpt of The Girls Club on Amazon and got so sucked into the main character's plight, I just had to buy it and finish reading it that day. It's beautifully written, the characters are richly drawn, and the story is compelling. The transformation of Cora Rose, the protagonist and narrator, throughout all the stages of her life from growing up in a Catholic family with three sisters, to her illness, marriage, motherhood, and subsequent sexual awakening is absolutely riveting. I'm looking forward to reading more work by Sally Bellerose. </p>

 <p> I feel the rating is somewhere between 3 and 4 stars mainly because I really didn't feel the first person narrative worked very well in the beginning. But the character really grew into her voice, or the other way around.Four stars because this is a book just the way I like it and would like to see more of in lesfic. Not a romance, thank you very much, just a story about life that includes love, but so much more as well.Very satisfying read dispite my problems in the beginning. </p>

 <p> ..."For the record, times are changing. Sooner or later people are going to wake up and being a lesbian won't be a big deal." My favorite line from this book by Sally Bellerose, local author from Northampton, MA. The setting for the story is Chicopee, 1970's. With the angst of relationships that sometimes work and sometimes don't, throw in the mix of trying to understand your own sexuality as a teen....yep, think she's got a winner here! Some parts of the story cross the timeline and can be imagined today...young people pushed together by unplanned pregnancy, struggling to make ends meet in a difficult economy. I've seen Cora Rose in so many women in my lifetime, her struggle for happiness, to be a good mother. The conflict of trying to understand her sexuality and her Catholic upbringing make this story memorable. Her relationship with her sisters makes her crazy at times and also keeps her grounded....wow, same as most of us with sisters! The characters in this story are so well written, I felt like I was in the room watching the scenes unfold. Kudos!! </p>

 <p> Your sister.  For a woman, she's the person who knows you better than you do yourself sometimes.  She knows your secrets, your strengths and how to push your buttons faster than anyone else.  She'll torment you incessantly and then punch in the nose any bully who tries the same thing.  Sisters form a girls club unlike any other.The title of Sally Bellerose's debut novel has a double meaning.  One refers to a lesbian bar that has particular appeal to one of the characters.  The other refers to the ultimate club shared by Marie, Renee and Cora Rose LaBarre.  Like most sisters they fight, they compete and they form a united front against the world, most of the time.  Cora Rose is the youngest sister and the focus of the book.  Her life is a jumble of issues from her conflict with her Catholic upbringing to the fact that she ends up married to a man she doesn't love because she tries to conform to what society dictates and ends up pregnant.  The truth is that her attraction is to women, but she doesn't know how to cope with it.  Blunt, direct Marie calls her on the issue when they are still teenagers and sophisticated, beautiful Renee will help guide her to the light eventually.  In the process they deal with unplanned pregnancies, men who fail to meet their needs, drug and alcohol abuse, creating careers, dealing with family issues and the general struggle with life.  Cora Rose deals with two extra issues, her sexuality, which she doesn't understand, and a chronic illness dubbed the Dreaded Bowl Disease.  That last issue isn't one that normally appears in books, but it plays a central role in what happens.Bellerose has created a book that doesn't easily fit into any category.  Cora Rose is a lesbian, but her life does not revolve around that.  There are no torrid love scenes to appeal to romance lovers, but there is a type of romance that develops between the sisters.  Their love for each other, even when it is disguised as something else, is the strongest relationship in the book.  There is no mystery or adventure here, except that which normally appears in life.  Instead there is a complex story of how people interact, especially within a family, and struggle to find direction in their lives.  Marie, the most direct sister, takes on life with a "take no prisoners" attitude.  Renee, the perfect child, is a study in unfulfilled potential and Cora Rose is a passive aggressive personality, letting life shove her from event to event, resenting much of what she is presented with, but basically incapable of directing her own story.  When she finally begins to assert herself and establish her own course, there is no surprise that the two people who are pushing and leading her along are the ones with whom she has spent her whole life.Readers will find much to relate to in this story as they recognize how the sisters interact.  Instead of depending on emotionally powerful scenes, Bellerose makes her point by letting the reader just watch the sisters and their lives unfold.  It has a slow steady pace, but it becomes clear by the end that the pace that is used is the only one that works.  The reader can expect a story that is deeper and more intricate than the average lesbian novel.  It requires more attention than just sliding through a typical story of girls meets, girls resolve their conflicts and live happily ever after.  It's similar to watching an intricate dance or drinking a fine wine.  The reader won't get the full effect until the end. </p>

 <p> Sally Bellerose is absolutely brilliant in her approach with this title.  I vacillated between loving, liking, being annoyed, being uncomfortable to just simply being impressed with it all by the end.  Cora Rose is simply a character that one can spend mental time wanting to fuss at, as well as fuss over.  That is what makes this title work so well.  This is a discussion of life just like our own lives and families. It was a pleasurable surprise that the discussion of coming out/lesbian attraction took a back seat to life and bowel diseases.  I highly recommend and look forward to Ms. Bellerose's next title. </p>
