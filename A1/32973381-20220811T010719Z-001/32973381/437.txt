 <p> Salmon is simple - olive oil, garlic & lemon juice; poach or sear.  These recipes have ingredients that are not generally in my kitchen. </p>

 <p> I had previously purchased and enjoyed the tasty, boneless chicken recipes from this same author and was delighted to see that the high standards set in the chicken book have been followed up here.The recipes in this book are quite easy to make, which is great for as aspiring, beginner home chefs. The range of vegetables suggested really suit the recipes. Many kids don't like salmon, however the fish fingers recipe is a great idea to get them to try it. None of the recipes are too outlandish, so people that enjoy salmon should enjoy the bulk of what they find in this book.My personal favourites were the paprika salmon and the lemon salmon kebabs. </p>

 <p> I have been trying to find a good cookbook for fish recipes for ages and I am so happy to say this is it! All the other books and recipes were so complicated and used methods and ingredients I did not really understand. The recipes in this book are easy to follow and so diverse. The book has salad dishes, pastas, marinades, breakfast ideas, you name it. What I like the most, is that they are quick to make. None of the recipes take longer than 40-50 minutes. That's perfect for someone like me who loves to cook, but never has time for it.I loved the Salmon Fish Cakes (I always wanted to learn how to make this) and I made the Salmon Curry for my husband for dinner and he loved it so much he asked me to make it next time his parents visit us. Really happy with this book. Definitely recommend it! </p>

 <p> I love the devise range of salmon recipes in this book; from a smoked pate to salmon cannelloni it covers lots of styles.My children love the salmon picnic rolls, which they like to that in their school lunch box. The picnic rolls take about 40 min's to make and there is just over 30 over them in each batch.Most of the recipes are easy to whip up and they are very easy to follow! </p>

 <p> I eat a lot of salmon, and go fishing in the Pacific Northwest yearly for them. While high grade salmon is delicious just baked with some butter, salt, and lemon, those that eat a lot of it may want more complex recipes. Plus, these recipes sound like they would be good with the lower quality pink, or farmed salmon, which is better with some added ingredients.A few of the reviews mention that the recipes have ingredients that are not common in a normal pantry, and I agree. But most of the recipes only require one unusual ingredient, and I'm willing to buy it for a change up in a meal.Many of the unique ingredients are herbs or spices, which the author recommends to buy fresh. I agree with that, Examples are fresh coriander, basil, thyme, dill, chives, ginger, parsley and marjoram.Other not too common ingredients are Thai curry paste, cr&egrave;me frache, jerk seasoning, harissa Moroccan spice, fennel bulb, sherry vinegar, and fresh chervil.I tried the smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, and it was delicious. I'm going to make the baked salmon strips next.In time, I will make all of the recipes in the book. These aren't anything you will find on the internet.Highly recommended for salmon lovers. This book is a keeper. </p>

 <p> This book has 31 easy to follow recipes for salmon dishes. I was grateful that the author broke away from the most basic recipes for this meaty fish and gave us some new ones to try without making them too complicated. Most of the items you will need to make these dishes can be found in a basic pantry. I thought the book was well organized and easy to follow and I liked the personal touches the author used when describing the perfect meal accompaniments. I look forward to trying a few of these recipes as they are versatile and can be modified easily to meet the needs and desires of your family. </p>

 <p> I've purchased and read other cookbooks by Jenny Collins and I really like her style. The recipes are very easy to follow and I like the mix of simple and complex dishes.Fish is not really something I normally prepare but I really want to start including this in my regular diet starting with salmon. This cookbook, like the others, does not disappoint. There are many recipes that look very tasty to me starting with the Salmon Curry, Salmon Fish Cakes and the Parsley Encrusted Salmon Fillets. I'm adding one of these to my menu planning for the week. Well done on another great cookbook! </p>

 <p> I loved Jenny's chicken book and I love salmon, so as soon as this book came up, I grabbed it. Once again, the recipes are easy to read and the directions are perfect.I can't wait the make the Salmon En Croute. I will make it for something special, but this group at my house has to have Turkey for Christmas.Her children must have very sophisticated palates to have salmon as their favorite fish. I couldn't get mine to even eat fish.I immediately made one of her wonderful simple recipes. I made the fish cakes and My husband and I really enjoyed them. The nice thing about Jenny's books is that you can usually find what you want to cook already in your freezer or pantry.Buy this book. You can't go wrong. </p>

 <p> We eat a lot of Salmon at our house, but we've kind of gotten into a rut with the same couple of recipes. This book is filled with great ideas that I can't wait to try. Finally bought my own BBQ grill and am especially looking forward to the grilled Salmon recipes. The recipes really are quite simple to make. </p>

 <p> I liked this book, and enjoyed reading all of the recipes, but I have to agree with the other reviewer. The recipes contained a lot of ingredients that I don't have in my kitchen. Also, the formatting was hard to follow because recipes ran together. There were a lot of ingredients in the recipes as well, so they seemed more complicated than the title implied. Sorry! </p>

 <p> I am a HUGE fan of Jenny Collins' cookbooks.  I bought her Chicken cookbook31 Tasty Boneless Chicken Breast Recipesand have made almost every recipe in it.  So I was excited to see her new cookbook with Salmon recipes.  Salmon is a superfood and I've included it in my diet since early Spring.  But it's hard to come up with new ways to prepare it.Jenny has some wonderful salmon recipes in this book.  All of her recipes are simple, easy to prepare, fast and yet elegant.  And they all look delicious!  As with her chicken cookbook these look to be original family recipes.  She has a nice introduction to each recipe which I enjoyed reading.  She also includes the servings, prep time and cooking time.  She's the only author I've seen who provides cooking temperatures in celcius, farenheit and gas mark.  There's also a nice mix of grilled, pan-cooked and oven-cooked recipes.Some of the recipes that I'll be trying first:  Salmon Cooked in an Italian Style Tomato Sauce, Salmon Fish Cakes and Pan-Fried Salmon Fillets with Cheesy New Potatoes.  If you like simple, easy and tasty recipes I'd recommend this cookbook by Jenny Collins. </p>

 <p> Did not find a single recipe I would even try.  Most of the ingredients were not readily available in my local grocery store.  I think if is geared more to a European market. </p>
