<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I enjoyed this book. The story line was interesting and kept me hooked until I completed the book.  It was clean and a sweet romance with some trouble added to it.  Julianne needs a husband in order to get her inheritance from her father.  She has 8 months to do it or he will choose one for her.  Her butler finds her a man that she had seen bathing in a lake on her property.  She is attracted to he stable hand and hires him to be her husband. They arrive back in England and fall in love with each other.  But there are some other problems. Julianne's younger sister Maddie wants Andrew aka the stable hand for her own. She causes a lot of problems with the couple and the man she is to marry. </p>

 <p> This is book three. Book one was a good story with likable characters but very bad editing. Book two was the same but the editing was better. Now comes book two with a very good story but the editing has gotten worse. When Andrew is stepping down from a coach he suddenly becomes ''she&#34;. Later some one is looking at someone else &#34;in disbelieving&#34; not in disbelief. Instead of &#34;suspected&#34; the truth about something someone is &#34;expected&#34; the truth. One of the characters thinks &#34;nah&#34; to herself instead of no and the last line is &#34;Ditto, my love&#34;. Ditto? Really? In a historical novel?Okay, now that I have expressed my displeasure with the sad state of editing in this electronic world I will say that I do really enjoy the stories. They are entertaining, passionate yet clean and have enjoyable characters. I'm just so tired of grammatically reconstructing sentences. </p>

 <p> I Felt Like I Was Watching A Soap Opera Unfold </p>

 <p> Once again, I found myself disappointed. I thought I was going to read a &#34;sweet romance&#34;, other reviewers on Amazon called it that, but I found myself reading a soap opera instead. I like Juliana. I liked Andrew. I liked that Andrew married her in earnest instead of a fake marriage. I did have a little trouble with her sleeping with him latter on that count. She thinks they aren't married, and that this relationship is temporary, but she goes along with that anyway.My biggest complaint was her sister though. First, she sixteen! Second, what is she doing hitting on her sister's husband? Third, who tries to sleep with her sister's husband when he's drunk?  That really felt like a soap opera, and just plain trashy! While all of the content was technically clean (not described), the subject matter was not. There was marital sex, there was an almost rape, there was consentual sex with a minor, and an attempted seduction of a married man. I've enjoyed Marie Higgins other books, but this is the second one in this series with iffy content. I'm just done reading this series, but I'll give her other books a try. </p>

 <p> 'True Loves Deception'  was a chore to finish.  The plot wasn't plausible.  Many of the characters weren't believable.  The movements leading up to the ending were unreal. </p>

 <p> As in the first two books in this series, my interest was captured from the very first. Juliana manages to teach her 'pretend husband' gentleman manners to fool her family. Her stepsister tries to break up the marriage for her own selfish desires and it puts an interesting twist in the situation. Loved it!! </p>

 <p> I enjoyed this story overall.  This book, like all the others in this series need some serious editing.  SPOILER! They lost me on this one when the younger step sister (a gently bred young lady) is thrown out of the house.  That simply would not happen in that era.  You might as well send her to a brothel.  Arrangements would have been made to remove her from her family, but see to her needs.  Except for that huge issue, the book was a fun read with great characters. </p>

 <p> OMG, just finished my 3rd book by Marie Higgins and absolutely loved it. You have the ice queen, deception, honor, love, lies and intrigue all rolled into one great book!!! Juliana needs a fake husband fast to get her inheritance to pay her grandmothers debt. The only eligible male is her new stable hand Andrew Dean. She offers him more money that he will earn in a lifetime to pose as he husband. What she doesn't know is that Andrew paid a real priest to marry them. He is welcomed into the family with open arms, a little too much in Maddies case (Juliana's step sister). She tries to break the couple up as they slowly fall in love. Andrew finds out he us the lost son of Matthew Lawrence and he is actually a wealthy and titled gentleman. Juliana and Andrew go through some trials but end up happily ever after!!! Off to book #4. </p>

<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Stable Hand, Headstrong Woman and a Jealous Sister, oh my what a story! </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Juliana needs a husband in order to save her Grandmother but she does not want to give up her independence.  The solution is to hire a pretend husband but the pickings are slim leaving her with the only choice available--a muck covered stable hand, Andrew.  Juliana offers to pay Andrew to be her husband but she looks down on the servant.  Andrew needs the money so she agrees and tries to tolerate the snobbish and entitled employer.  Juliana deceives her friends and family, Andrew deceives Juliana and Juliana's half sister, Maddie, plots to ruin everything.  The delays in Juliana and Andrew consummating their marriage is cute.  The storyline is unique and makes for an interesting book.  The book is a fast read and the romance is sweet and beige with no soft porn descriptions; however, that does not mean the book is not full of romance and love.The downsides:  There was a twist in the story that is easily figured out early on but it did not diminish the story but I would have liked to see what would have happened to the characters without the twist; Andrew had such dreams of making his own fortune and home, the plot twist seemed to take that away and this is why I gave the story 4 stars.  In addition, the story could have been longer because a few scenes and story-lines felt rushed and not fully fleshed out.I read the book in one setting and enjoyed it enough to get the other books in the series. </p>
