 <p> I already own several doll pattern books, and this one is a fine addition to my collection.  It has a number of patterns that can easily be adapted to taste.  I especially love the traditional coat.  Once I make the first one, I am going to adapt the pattern to make a short jacket that will go perfectly with my doll's kilted skirt.  The accessories are really special  and add that finishing touch to the outfits.  The puppy pillow would also make a nice camping pillow or set upon.  The dog pattern looks like a fun project.  You will have fun with this book. </p>

 <p> A good range of clothing, and  really cute accessories </p>

 <p> Bought this jewel of a book because I fell in love with the grey coat on the front jacket.  I've already made skirts and blouses to fit a little girl's American Girl doll and am now cutting out the beautiful 18" doll-size coat.  It's a fine book with well-drawn full-size patterns that fit well.  Just use this book and your imagination for some lovely dolly clothes. </p>

 <p> A great pattern and idea book ... </p>
