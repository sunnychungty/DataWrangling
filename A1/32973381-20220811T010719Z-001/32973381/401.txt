 <p> It's another free instructables book and can be a lot of fun and they're worth the time looking at them. There's a bit of tongue-in-cheek humor in the way theyre put together. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Another fun read for those who like books on hacks and the price is unbeatable </p>

 <p> I love any book that makes my life more fun and whimsical or easier and this book does all of the above. I am going to get a copy of this book for anyone just starting out in life not so much for the exact hacks but to give them a fitting way of thinking.  To help them think in a different way. To give them a more critically cognitive way of thinking.  " OWN THE DAY" </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> TRULY AMAZING!!! </p>

 <p> It's a series of short &#34;hacks&#34; about stuff that are mostly self-evident. It don't think I finished it, actually. Done </p>

 <p> There are a few instructables inside that are interesting to read. It's free online and with the Kindle edition, so you can't go wrong.  The Mont Blanc pen hack is cool, if you want a top notch pen without the price. However, most of the hacks in this book are not ones I will use. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Instructable hacks in concise location. </p>

 <p> Didn' offer much in the way of new ideas and hard to understand. I might take another look at this book later when I have more time to understand it.My Mistake. On further review it is a very useful collection of ideas and how to apply them. I followed directions the second reading and had great success. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> My mistake. </p>

 <p> It's hard to dislike a free book. The subjects and examples weren't that helpful for my everyday life, but it's interesting if you are into being more resourceful, less wasteful, or creative. The link to other projects were interesting as well. I think I spent more time learing about activated carbon than reading the section that applied to it. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> interesting reads and tips </p>

 <p> This is not so much life hacks as it is a bunch of projects for specific random needs....most people will never need any of this information. For those who do I am sure that the same information is available on the web. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Not what I call life hacks </p>
