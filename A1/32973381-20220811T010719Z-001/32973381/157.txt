<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> See more of Sherilynn Fenn after midnight.... </p>

 <p> A lushly photographed Continental retelling of the Beauty-and-the- Beast/young-girl-comes-of-age-with-demon-who-turns-into-handsome-prince story, my commentary will part from other reviewers (I found the story predictable, and acting melodramatic) by mentioning my primary reason for purchase of this video: the Tuscan villa setting including the famous "Monster Grotto". The sculpture garden attributed to a retired 'condottiere' who commissioned grotesque sculptures for his meditative garden, reflecting his supposed cynical worldview. The views of this Tuscan curiosity are worth the lightweight fairy tale surrounding it. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Sherilyn Fenn stars as Catherine, the heiress to a beautiful Italian villa. Catherine is visited by her friend Gina, and together, the two set out to see a traveling carnival that is passing though town. The girls invite the performers back to the castle, where they are drugged and seduced by their guests. As Catherine and Gina soon discover, they have become trapped in a family curse which can only be broken by true love and not carnal desire. Charles Band's dark fantasy plays on the traditional fairy tale of Beauty and the Beast, which has been updated and eroticized for mature audiences. MERIDIAN features a strong cast, competent storytelling, and unique creature effects by Greg Cannom that make it one of Full Moon's better Gothic Horror films. Band shows that he can provide all of the same stylism and atmosphere as many of the bigger names, but on a much smaller budget. The onscreen romance between Catherine and Oliver also feels genuine, even if the characters are a bit shallow. Fans of the SUBSPECIES series and Walerian Borowczyk's THE BEAST are sure to enjoy MERIDIAN.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> ... or, I had sex with a werewolf (spoilers) </p>

 <p> If Laurell K. Hamilton ever wrote a straight romance novel, it would probably be something like "Meridian" -- lots of flowing shirts, rape... and sex with a furry werewolf.And if you aren't a fan of those things, then "Meridian" won't have a lot to recommend itself. This movie tries to be both a sexploitation movie AND a "beauty and the beast" gothic romance, but just ends up being painfully slow-moving and incoherent. Not to mention that the constant rape and furry sex completely neutralizes any hint of actual sexiness to be found.The story follows Catherine Bomarzini (Sherilyn Fenn), an American art student who returns to her family castle in Italy. Then her idiot friend Gina (Charlie Spradling) invites a troupe of wandering magicians to dinner at the castle, led by the arrogant Lawrence (Malcom Jamieson). Then the troupe drugs the two women so Lawrence can rape them, followed by him handing off Catherine to his twin brother Oliver (Jamieson again).Apparently we're supposed to view THEIR sex as being real lovemaking, but she still seems rather dopey. Oh, and Oliver turns into a werewolf while raping Catherine.The following day, Catherine begins seeing strange visions from the past -- a dead girl in a flowing white dress, a werewolf (guess who it is!) and a secret passage filled with red light. She also begins to figure out that there is a longtime curse associated with her family, and that Oliver (whom she thinks is the same person as Lawrence) can only be freed by her.The first half of "Meridian" is pure sexploitation (rape, boobies, Sherilynn Fenn naked), with every possible excuse to show boobs bouncing out of tight shirts. But after our first glimpse of the werewolf, director Charles Band starts trying to turn it into an atmospheric gothic romance with curses, a werewolf, a tormented Byronic hero in flowing white shirts and a mysterious painting. It fails. A lot.The movie sludges along at a painfully slow pace, with awful dialogue ("I have no world without you") and a lot of things that are never explained (that giant secret passage leading directly into a bedroom? Never explained). It drapes itself with scarlet velvet, moonlight, silver jewelry and shirts straight off of a romance novel cover, but Band can't hide the wretchedly contrived story.And the climax is fascinatingly ludicrous: a werewolf holding a crossbow is thwarted by a whip-cracking dwarf in Elizabethan garb. I felt like someone had slipped drugs into MY drink.One of the biggest problems is the rape. Not only does the villain date-rape the heroine and her friend, but it's shot in a slow-motion, erotic manner, as if Band was trying to make it alluring. And it's made even worse because the HERO also rapes her. Yes. While the heroine is meant to be coming out of her drugged stupor, her lack of reaction to having sex with a werewolf shows she was still pretty out-of-it.Oh yes. There is sex with a werewolf in full furry form, and we're supposed to find it erotic. It's not erotic. It's actually rather grotesque to those without furry fetishes, and it negates any slight hints of sexiness that the movie might produce.And despite Fenn's decent acting, the characters are just awful. Catherine is a walking blank who reacts instead of acting, and Spradling's entire purpose in the movie is to clean a painting and pick up a crossbow. As for Jamieson's double performance as Lawrence and Oliver (oh, cute), he's a little too excessive as both the evil mustache-twirling rapist and the brooding sad-eyed woobie."Meridian" is a disaster in every way -- a rapey sexploitation movie that tries to transform itself into a gothic romance. As anything other than a showcase for slow-motion boobs, it fails. </p>

 <p> A Beauty and the Beast romantic fantasy story crafted by a horrorsmith </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This is a Beauty and the Beast romantic fantasy story crafted by a horrorsmith using horror elements.  Surprisingly good!Director Charles Band (the Puppet Master, Subspecies, Ghoulies and Trancers franchises) in this more seriously approached, surprisingly good Full Moon romantic fantasy-horror release.Two attractive American women find themselves in Italy after graduating from art school.  Gina (Charlie Spradling; Bad Channels, Puppet Master II, The Blob) is working in art restoration and her friend Catherine (Sherilyn Fenn; Boxing Helena, The Wraith) has just inherited a castle.  The castle comes with a curse about some wizard who built the castle and cursed people by turning them to stone--and there are loads of statues.After enjoying a traveling carnival attraction complete with a dwarf  (Phil Fondacaro; Troll, Ghoulies II, The Creeps), strong man, snake charmer, fire eater, belly dancer, magician and other carney weirdoes.  Looking for some interesting company, Gina and Catherine invite the performers to dinner, after which they are drugged and sensually &#34;taken&#34; by the magician.  But the strange thing is--because, no, we haven't hit the strange part yet--the magician has a twin brother whose werewolf roots become most evident in coitus.The next morning the girls have little recollection of what events transpired and Catherine's nanny (Hilary Mason; Dolls, Don't Look Now, Robot Jox) is left to clean up the mess.  Later Catherine is plagued by visions of a murdered young woman.  The nanny reveals that the &#34;vision&#34; is linked to the castle's curse, Gina's recent work on a painting is connected to it, and that Catherine is the next!The effects and action are the primary weak points of this film.  The transformation scenes are mostly reduced to frame shifts between human and werewolf form (i.e., there is not much of an on camera &#34;transformation&#34; at all), the werewolf make-up is unimpressive, the limited action is implied more than really being delivered, and there are no scares.  But &#34;horror&#34; wasn't really the point of this film, implied violence was all that was necessary for the story to be effective, and the lack of scares was intentional and not a product of shoddy direction.  This is more of a romantic fantasy story crafted by a horrorsmith using some horror elements.This film revealed that Charles Band is capable of so much more than his campy, gory horror.  The sexuality of the magician and his twin tender a strong dichotomy.  The magician is cruel, manipulative and lustful whereas his werewolf twin is gentle, protective and passionate.  The werewolf offers a more Beauty and the Beast sense of fantasy.This was surprisingly good!  Really. </p>

 <p> Okay, what can i say, this movie is a classic. I realy miss all of the Full Moon Entertainment, Straight to Video Releases. I miss those good old days, lol. When people could just drive down to the Video Store, and Pick up a VHsS, and rent it. But, Whatever happened to Charlie Spradling? She was always my favorite actress from the Fullmoon Films, and i haven't heard from here since then. Waste of good talent. </p>

 <p> The acting was more than fine.  I have to remember that times have changed and that includes background and set direction in movies.  By reading the movie summary, I should have predicted it would not be rated with five stars by me.  I am changing my original star rating from three to four, since I need to remember the year it was produced when providing the star rating. </p>

 <p> EROTIC TAKE ON BEAUTY AND THE BEAST BY RICH J.SPANBURGHFull Moon Video took full advantage of the new sexy genre take on creature movies.Taking advantage of European locales using old castles as settings for stories of the occult. using new faces like Fenn and unknown actors who get paid scale.I really like this movie,it has beauty,a good story,a slight twist and a small amount of nudity just to keep the viewer aroused and to take in the whole story about a woman who is chosen to change a curse put on a man who has the mark  of the beast.I give this movie 3 stars out of 5. See this movie,it's not a classic but it will keep you interested. </p>

 <p> Another DVD that I got because of the lead actress. The movie itself is quite formulaic, with one or two small surprises. I don't think Sherilyn Fenn has ever looked better...in a movie, anyway. </p>
