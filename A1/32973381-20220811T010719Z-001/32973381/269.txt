 <p> I now have the entire ten seasons of JAG.  Season seven begins with the second half of the season six cliff-hanger &#34;Adrift.&#34;  Mac's engagement to Brumby comes to an abrupt end and that's just the first part of this excellent season.  Each of the actor's has settled into their roles and are all believable.  The military part of the show is true to life.  The uniforms and medals are correct and the military courtesies are also portrayed well.  This has always been one of my favorite series as are its spinoffs (NCIS and NCIS: LA). If you like courtroom and military drama then this is a must haves.  It certainly is for me.  One can watch these episodes over and over and never grow tired of them.  I definitely give this two thumbs up. </p>

 <p> After having watched season 1 of Jag, my mother was so enthused with Jag, that I had to order all of the subsequent tapes, but luckily just two at a time for her.  She is now up to season 7,  how many more are there to go????? </p>

 <p> Adore David James Elliott ... can't believe this series was going to be cut after the 1st season, wonder who took the heat for that 'million dollar' mistake!  The JAGATHON episode was hilarious and excellently strung together, loved the flash forward sequences.  Absolutely, absolutely can not wrap my head around the fact that Harm is married to Lt. Singer in REAL life!!!!!!!  The one person on the show that doesn't seem affected by his charisma and charm AND it's his real life wife, totally blown away! </p>

 <p> I never used to watch TV in the morning until I happened to see JAG and have been a faithful "watcher" since. Unfortunately because of my work I have missed a lot of episodes. I have 1 to 5 series but I wish they would release all of them so I can have them all- in one package. I think it is the best put together drama- the cast is excellent and they all seem to be perfect for their roles, all attuned to each other. Altho my main hero is David Elliott, everyone is integral to the quality of each episode, superbly written and acted. I have not seen a more handsome and well put together man in years. Inspite of the fact that I was never in the military, I feel that it is very accurate in its depiction of the conditions in the real JAG. It is a drama that takes itself seriously- and rightly so. </p>

 <p> JAG was one of the best shows on TV and I still miss seeing it after 3 years.  It was a good tribute to our service men and women and showed them as normal human beings doing a difficult job that put their life on the line.  It also had its humorous moments in addition to the drama.  I have all 7 seasons released so far and love watching the shows again.  For some reason a person never tires of watching them over and over again.  Not many shows have that kind of appeal. </p>

Adrift (2)2. New Gun in Town3. Measure of Men4. Guilt5. Mixed Messages6. Redemption7. Ambush8. Jag-a-thon9. Dog Robber (1)10. Dog Robber (2)11. Answered Prayers12. Capital Crime13. Code of Conduct14.

 <p> I like all the episodes of this show/I guess it is in part due to seeing men & women in uniform as well as watching Elliot, Bell,  and Jackson perfect their craft so as to make their roles so believable to me. I will not be sorry to have made this purchase/the series to me shows no aging as time goes by. </p>

 <p> This has got to be the best year ever for this series. Not only are Harm and Mac tiptoeing around their love for one another, but there are several "continued" episodes that leave you wanting more. One of which involves the dreadful LT Singer and the beginning of the wonderful series NCIS. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I did not see these when they were on TV, so I am watching them in retrospect to see how the series led to NCIS.  The writing doesn't quite measure up to that of NCIS, but the use of characters' backstories to move the action forward keeps one watching for the details. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> A successful TV show... </p>

 <p> JAG tv series got better bit by bit and the whole show was good. I particularly liked Adm. Chegwedin's (John M. Jackson) acting and I hope to see more of him in the future. He's a great actor and really can be a top actor in the film industry. All in all, JAG series was a lot better than the other military focused tv shows. It got better in each season and it could have continued to this day. A successful tv show! </p>

 <p> I can not be a very fir judge to any of the stories in any seasons because I am a big fan of it.  Specifically season 7 includes many events that changes people's lives makes very interesting, clean, and humorous. </p>
