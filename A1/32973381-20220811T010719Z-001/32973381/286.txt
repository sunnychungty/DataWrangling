 <p> This is a cute DVD for any Disney fan, especially Jake & the Never Land Pirate fans!  My boys (3 and 5) have loved this show since it started and I admit I like it too because Peter Pan has always been one of my favorite Disney movies!  This DVD is great though because it features so many great episodes, including one we hadn't seen before featuring Captain Hooks mom!  Even though we have seen all the other episodes it is nice to have the DVD to watch Jake and the gang anytime.  We brought this DVD to grandmas, the car, even the hospital while my little guy was there.  The animation is great, the singing is fun, and the lessons are perfect for preschoolers to understand. </p>

 <p> Jake and the Never Land Pirates combines a tot's-eye-view of make believe pirate games (where pirates have pop music dances and tea parties) with the Peter Pan setting -- plus a morsel of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, a dash of Dora and the coins of Mario Bros.What is doesn't always have is Peter himself, except in this "feature" special now on DVD (actually a hour long episode) in which he does appear and the gang helps him regain his gift of flight and happy thoughts. (Fans of Walt Disney's original 1953 Peter Pan might get a kick out of his reverse angle song, "I Can't Fly, I Can't Fly, I Can't Fly."Adam Wylie, who costarred as a child on Picket Fences and has become a veteran of stage, TV and voice acting (as well as a magician at Disneyland), voices Peter with a good feel for Bobby Driscoll's performance. The show really doesn't try to recapture the film, but instead takes a colorful preschool approach, with simple characters designs and lots of peppy songs. There's even a live-action pair of singing pirates in each episode (similar to what Filmation did back in the early '70s with The Hardy Boys).The breakout star of every show is Captain Hook, played brilliantly by Corey Burton completely for comedy and minus the menace. To keep true to the source material, Hook, Smee and his crew are never familiar with the more contemporary materials that Jake and company enjoy, calling anything modern a "thingy" or some such. Scooby Doo fans take note: more than once, Hook refers to the young pirates as "meddling swabs."The DVD is generously supplied with other episodes in addition to "Peter Returns" with ten additional segments, or the equivalent of five half hour shows -- including one featuring Hook's mother, voiced by Sharon Osbourne! </p>

 <p> Jake and The Never Land Pirates: Peter Pan Returns is a 2012 Disney DVD compilation of a 48-minute direct-to-DVD premiere and five of the Disney Channel/Disney Junior animated series based on the Disney animated classic Peter Pan. In this DVD Peter Pan returns to Never Land and visit Jake, Izzy, Cubby and Skully the Parrot after Peter's trickster shadow ran away and causes trouble for Capt. Hook and his crew. So when Hook captures the shadow, he sends a warning to Peter and the Never Land Pirates and Jake and his crew must rescue the shadow before Peter loses his magic. Also, there are five episodes of the Jake and the Never Land Pirates, which includes the Pirates meeting the Pirate Princess and Capt. Hook getting a visit from his mother, Mama Hook(Voiced by Sharon Osbourne, The Talk, The Osbournes). The special features includes a music video by Sharkey and Bones and sneak peeks of other Disney favourites, like a promo for Disney Junior, and a teaser trailer for the Disney/PIXAR animated film Planes, to be released later this year. Peter Pan Returns is perfect for pre-schoolers and toddlers alike and a great addition to any Disney DVD collection. </p>

 <p> This is a movie that is engaging even for the young at heart. My youngest loves Jake and this movie was a no brainer! He actually watches it all the way through which is tough for youngsters! I even enjoyed it! </p>

 <p> A win win! </p>

 <p> Peter Pan returns to lead Jake and The Neverland Pirates on their first full length adventure.  During the game of &#34;catch me if you can,&#34; Peter Pan's mischievous shadow slips away and ends up in the hands of sneaky Captain Hook.  Jake, Izzy, Cubby and your child help Peter rescue his shadow.There is more, five more episodes.  The DVD is full of action, songs, fun, and teaches good friends can do great things when they work together. </p>

 <p> My little one loves Jake. The movie included is the one where Peter loses his Shadow. There are several other episodes on this video. Lots of good songs and of course lots of Sharky and Bones. There are some bonus features but we haven't gotten to them yet. We just hit play all and enjoy. </p>

 <p> Great Value - Movie plus episodes </p>
