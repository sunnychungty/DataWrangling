<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Tip snapped off within first week </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Initially I loved this item and it seemed like a great deal. However I installed it into a wall and everything was fine until I turned my tv just slightly and the tip snapped off. I thought it might be my fault but looked closer at the other tip and it is very loose. Not sure if i got  bad cable or not because all the great reviews but I am returning as defective and purchased a longer cable. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> it works. </p>

 <p> This is a well-built, high-speed hdmi cable. I wanted it in white to match other mac-ish cables, and it looks good. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Great for a small media setup </p>

 <p> This cable is perfect for our OUYA and Macbooks connecting to the TV in our bedroom. Our bedroom has a single glass shelf for media and TV mounted to the wall. I wanted to get a white cable to reduce visibility. Now if I could just figure out a way to make shadows invisible the cable will blend into the wall perfectly. </p>

 <p> Just right </p>

 <p> I'll say it again: there is NO REASON to pay big store prices for HDMI cables! I have had no issues with ANY of the many HDMI cables I have bought on Amazon in the past few years. </p>

 <p> The connections aren't tight, but i'm not sure if it's the monitor or the cable.  Other than that it works. </p>

 <p> The cable arrived when expected and works great built well and you can't beat the price, if you are still buying your cables at a store why unless you need it that very moment. </p>

 <p> i just got this in the mail, and the cable was so thick, it was just generic, had generic ends that look nothing like the picture, I got this to go with my Cable Matters av cable to go between my ipad and hdtv(awesome product). This one didnt even say cable matters on it, so I returned. Amazon has been great to deal with so far in 2 years, love them. Anyway, I ordered the rocketfish, hdmi ULTRA THIN cable. Thats what I need, not a heavy bulky cable that pulls on my CABLE Matters av cable, out of ipad, alot of times. So I realized I needed the ultra slim, light weight, bendable. I am very happy with finding the rocketfish and sorry still learning hpw to post links on here with ipad. So, I have ipad2 to cable matters av cable (32.95) to hdmi cable 6 ft to vizio 42 inch hdtv 120hz, and telefunken ipad stand and I totally love this setup, I added an ihome bluetooth speaker, idm12, and that just adds a wireless speaker, either that, or ipad speaker or tv speakers, very happy here.I might have made an assumption about the size of the cable, but it was generic, so 1 star, it really only deserves a half star. </p>

 <p> A Good Quality HDMI Cord For When Color Matters </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I recently mounted a television in my parents custom kitchen, but there was not a good way for me to run any cords through the wall.  This cord blended in well with the molding that I used for the wall run.  The picture quality and consistency have been what one should expect from a quality HDMI cable. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> good cables </p>

 <p> I got this cable for my new  TV. I got the extra long so I could place it in the wall and extend it out when I need to. It does fine. </p>

 <p> This product is just as it says. It arrived quickly, picture works fine even through an HDMI splitter.  I would purchase this item again and especially at the price. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> The cable is thicker (more insulated) that I thought. I have bought many different kind of HDMI cable and this one is nice, thick one. Of course, if you need to go around bend (like 90 deg), it might not be suitable, but this cable should be able to shield it from all sort of surrounding interference. </p>

 <p> Good product </p>

 <p> Works great.  Have had it since November with no problems.  Great price and blends very well with my apartment's white walls </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Great value quality built and HDCP compliant. HD television and devises have copy protection and cheaper HDMI cables don't all support this industry standard. Your DVD may be legitimate but it still may play.  Avoid wasted time and get HDCP compliant cables. </p>

 <p> Great Deal </p>

 <p> I purchased this cable to use with my iPad because I wanted a white cable to match my iPad cables.  This one works great--no problems at all with compatibility, sound or video.  I have been very pleased with it and highly recommend it for anyone looking for an HDMI cable to match Apple products. </p>
