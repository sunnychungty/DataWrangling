<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I love this version, because it is gender neutral and MUCH more understandable.  However in reading it in a study group where some of us have hard copies and others have Kindle versions, it would be SO nice to have it &#34;page number enabled&#34; so we can track each other better.Truly, if you have tried and tried again to read A Course In Miracles but get turned off because of the male language bias or the iambic pentameter prose making it difficult to understand, this is the version for you.So many times in the regular Course, we found ourselves puzzling over what a sentence could mean.  Was &#34;He&#34; or &#34;his&#34; referring to the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, or something else.  We had to stop at evey paragraph to try to figure it out.  This version makes it all very clear, and I actually feel included as a female too!Honestly, I went to one group where the leader translated every paragraph for the group.  Why should this be necessary? Thank you Liz!  I am so grateful that you stepped up to the plate and took on this monumental task.Now if you could just enable the &#34;page source&#34; function it would be easier to use in groups. </p>

 <p> I have tried many times to study ACIM, but the language was beyond me. It seemed to "talk' in circles. Liz's translation has brought it all home to me and now I feel I will finally get through the course and be able to apply it's wisdom to my life. Thank you Liz for this must have book! </p>

 <p> After reading the various versions of the A Course in Miracles texts I finally found one that is really user friendly. The Hugh Lynn Cayce version is good but this edition compliments it and brings out further details in clarity. I will be looking forward to the author's workbook edition. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I've been involved with A Course in Miracles for 23 years and found Liz's book "...A Translation of the Text in Plain Language" very helpful. I think it is beneficial to realize that the content(the message), not the form (wording)is the important issue. Some people try to make the "form" sacred and miss the content which is ACIM's unique defintion of forgiveness. Heck, there were several translations of ACIM from the get go, such as the Urtext. Again it's the "content" that needs to me mastered.  Liz is a wonderful mentor and her book entitled "The ACIM Mentor Articles...." is equally helpful. Highly recommend it as a pratical companion book. I can't close with best wishes to each of you studying the Course without saying that it is the BEST thing I ever done in my life. Jim Keil </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Mis-Translation of A Course In Miracles </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> A translation of A Course In Miracles from its incredibly beautiful prose to something someone here in form has to say is down right laughable. To get the message of the Course is all about reading it and reading it some more and some more, over and over again.  It can not be dumbed down and still be the same book, the same Course, the same anything resembling "A Course In Miracles".  Changing Jesus' words and thinking you are saying the same thing is preposterous.  This book is not supposed to be an easy read.  It is meant to be mined for the precious metals of thought and original statements of Truth contained therein. People are drawn to the Course for reasons they themselves may not know. This is not the kind of book one picks up to read cover to cover and then puts away.  It is a book to study. There are so many wonderful gems of information and instruction layered purposefully into the writing, including the beautiful flow of the language, to try to translate that, and from what I read the author misses much, is quite impossible.  If the author wanted to write a book about her impressions of A Course In Miracles, then by all means write on, but not under the guise of "The Message of..." as a translation. To put this forth as though it were the Course, using her words in place of Jesus' words I find to be disingenuous and just another way to "market" herself. If you are not reading, "A Course In Miracles", you are not reading, "A Course In Miracles", and you are reading something else.  Please do not call it "A Course In Miracles". </p>

<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> A Splendid Shining Pony </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I wonder how many of you out there have ridden a pony.  Oh, I don't mean a young horse...I mean a translation of a text written in some language of which one has not the firmest of grasps which helps one figure out what on earth the original text is saying.When I was in high school, slightly after the discovery of the alphabet, one rode through Caesar's Gaellic Wars on a pony.  That is to say, one threw up one's hands (and one's Latin dictionary) and consulted the pony, which was a literal translation of the text.This version of ACIM is a splendid, shining pony, far above, in comprehension and style, those dreary little pamphlets we relied upon to muck our way through Caesar.It is NOT ACIM, and it certainly does NOT offer the subtleties of Dr. Wapnick's commentaries (which perhaps are NOT for everyone); I don't think anyone in their Right Mind can maintain that.  But it is a splendid pony, helping one do a run through  of the Text.  And its endearing bonus is the inbuilt insights of the translator.I much feared an ersatz version of ACIM when this book was published.  Instead I found a splendid pony.  I got on and I'm riding.And guess what?  It's fun!Scott Hutton(Sidebar to those indentured to fear:  this work is also a night mare.  That is NOT to say a bad dream...that is to say a worthy mare upon whom one can ride through the terrors of the night.) </p>

 <p> I had tried to "do" the course before, but couldn't manage to understand the text....and after just reading the first section of the "Plain Language" version, I have a greater understanding right away. I feel that now I can complete the reading of the text and have just ordered the plain language version of the workbook. I am very happy.Great book, it is so very helpful. </p>
