<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Good structure, flat characters </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This story is nicely paced and structured, but the teen girls are about as flat as the giggly teen girls who are killed off in the first few minutes of a horror movie. (I should clarify, flat as in undeveloped characters, the girls in horror movies tend to be far from flat in the physical sense!) If they were more realistic and the reader could identify with them more, the story would be much stronger as they learn more and more about the ouija board and exactly what is driving it. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Mix twin teen girls with a Ouija board when they decide to while away the time during the enforced visits they must make to see their virtually catatonic grandfather in a nursing home.  They get a whole lot more than they bargained for and I think most readers will feel the heart rate pick up, with maybe a shiver down the spine. Well done short story. </p>

 <p> This was such a good short story and I can't believe he gives so much of his stuff away for free.  I love everything he writes, check out all his other stuff. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I found "Ouija Be My Friend" to be a quick, spine-tingling read that was rich with the flavor of the Georgia Lowcountry. Twins bored with spending time with their paralyzed grandfather each week at the nursing home entertain themselves with a ouija board. The secrets they discover on the other side spill into their lives in a deadly way. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> An absolutely fabulous scary story! </p>

 <p> First a word of warning!  Don't, and I mean don't, read this book at midnight and then plan on sleeping.  Mr Lupo scared the life out of me with this short story and, yes, I did read it at midnight.  Actually, I should be going to bed now but honestly I would rather sit here in my kitchen with all the lights on writing this review than go upstairs where it is dark and scary. Ok, so an owl hooting outside just made me jump, not to mention the bats that are flying around out there. Time to draw the curtains I think!So here it is, an absolutely fabulous scary story of the ghost of a serial strangler, two young sisters who just so happen to be twins, a nursing home and the twins grandfather.Not wishing to give too much away about this story but suffice to say the Ouija board, scary porter and a seemingly innocent nurse are worth paying attention to.This is such a fun read and honestly it is scary! Fabulously well written and skilfully crafted, Mr Lupo has managed to develop excellent characters an amazing plot and all the tension and suspense you could ever hope for in this short story.A brilliant read and a lot of fun. Thank you Mr Lupo for scaring me to death. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Could Have Been Better </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> The story was interesting and with a revamp or two could be better. The main trouble with it is that the girls are such brats that it is impossible to like them. In fact I was really hoping they would end up as victims. There is a small mark to denote a new section but the story could have been formatted a lot more neatly than it was. I actually think that stretched to novella length it could be a little better. The nurse side story was very interesting but handled way too quickly. Oh, a side-note to the author, it is ok to just write &#34;she said&#34; occasionally instead of constantly using other words. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Creepy but... </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> The premise of this short story is fun. I enjoyed the use of a Ouija board and found the plot creepy - a murderous ghost haunting a nursing home and speaking to the main characters through the game. Nice.Unfortunately I found the characters a bit flat. I didn't connect with them or like them. I also have a very hard time with the dialog used for Catherine and Rita. It was forced and actually comical at times - times that weren't meant to be funny. I feel the author was trying too hard to make the tween girls sound young and over shot it immensely.I downloaded this as a freebie and feel it was a fun read. It would be even better with a rewrite. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Ouija?  No. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> A short tale where twin teen girls act like obnoxious little brats and treat their grandfather like garbage while "visiting" with him at the nursing home.  When they find a Ouija board on a game shelf and decide to use it to pass the time, they get a little more than they'd bargained for.  I unfortunately found the characters both flat and typical, and the writing mediocre.Now, if grandpa had killed the little twits with the Ouija board at the end, THAT would have been a story. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> It was "ok" but the dialogue ruined it... </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This was a freebie, and a very quick read.It was a decent story, aimed completely at young adults. But the main characters attitudes and swearing got on my nerves. There was no need for it.The editing for Kindle was also a little off. No paragraph breaks and whatnot to signify that it was the next day/next week, and both characters dialogue ran into each other a few times.It was a nice (although a little predictable) story, which could be found in one of those collection of scary stories books. But what ruined it for me was the editing and the snotty attitude of the girls.2.5/5 from me. </p>

 <p> I just read a day ago.  As soon as I started reading I was intrigued.  But I didn't realize this was a short story; so I was a little disappointed.  I wanted the story to continue.  Needless to say, I really enjoyed this "short" story. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> What a pleasant surprise </p>

 <p> I started reading this book not really knowing what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised. The story of two young girls and how their lives get intwined with a Ouija board. What starts out as an innocent diversion becomes a really interesting story. It's a well written story that will hold your interest all the way through. Recommended! </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Nothing too original or exciting here </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> A Ouija board is such an established horror convention.  My hope was that an author using it would bring something new and fresh to the idea.That didn't really happen here.  Two bored sisters decide to play with a Ouija board and, yes, it does allow them to connect to a spirit.  The characters aren't presented with any level of depth or originality and things progress pretty much as you would expect. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Interesting idea </p>

 <p> What would happen if a living human body without a mind was used to contact a spirit using a Ouija board?  You hope that a couple of selfish teenage girls get what is coming to them.... </p>
