 <p> Eating low cholesterol dishes is a must for some people who have health concerns. Low Cholesterol dishes are usually thought to have no flavor at all, but this book gives you a bunch of recipes that actually taste very good.  There are those that have the misconception that serving a special diet costs more money than just eating anything you like, but that is not true.  The recipes in this book do not cost anymore to make than you are paying right now and you might even save money.  The book is separated by type of food and includes main dishes, side dishes, and dessert.  Other chapters include grilled recipes and all pastas.  These recipes are so good, you and your family won't even notice they are considered low cholesterol. </p>

All the recipes are for low cholesterol which is a given, but they are also divided in different kind of dishes such as main dish, pastas, side dishes, grilled food and because everyone loves it, healthy desserts for those that can't go without it.The recipes are easy to follow, the directions are very explicit, i'm not that experienced in the kitchen yet, but I was able to prepare some of the dishes myself without any problems. The recipes are good for almost everyone. </p>

 <p> This is an excellent cookbook, full of easy and flavorful recipes. There are no pictures of the dishes, but the book layout is very simple and useable. The recipes make the most of the natural ingredients instead of loading up on artificial substitutes. I own a lot of books about cooking and food, and I love to sit down with a cup of coffee and read my cookbooks. Absolutely wonderful with healthy recipes! </p>
