 <p> I'm so happy to have this superb collection including films I haven't seen before.  They are all masterpieces from first to very recent.  It's interesting to see Antonio Banderas in Law of Desire playing and looking like a 20 year old.  I only wish there were some film notes in the boxed set.  A great buy and definitely a collector's item. </p>

 <p> I can't say it any other way. As one critic once said, Almodovar doesn't just make movies. he is THE MOVIES! In light of that, he deserves his own box set.While not a complete box set of his works inclusive, this does feature a pretty good cross section of early works & recent works which confirm that Almodovar is indeed a film-making genius in every sense of the word. Let me also mention Law of Desire & Datador have never been available in dvd format here in north america prior to the release of this box.It may be a shame, however, for some customers to buy this box set if they already own all the other films in the package aside from those two. On the other hand, this is a great find for many as virtually all of the films here are now very difficult to find & some are currently out of print.Fortunately, I only owned Bad Education & Talk to Her on dvd before this was released so I didn't lose much by purchasing the entire box.As far as the plots or storylines go, I think it's fair to say the critics have already done a fantastic job so I'll skip the film introductions here. I can also safely assume all of us who are shopping for Almodovar know pretty much what to expect whether it be controversy, heartfelt stories, or madcap humor. If the gods of celluloid cinema would find it in their hearts to release another box set, I would surely appreciate it as there are four more films that are either out of print or never released in the states on dvd which would make nice gifts or great collector's items as well.In the meantime, I'm quite sure we are all atleast marginally pleased with the box we've received.The box itself is quite attractive featuring nice artwork all-around, lobby cards including orignal artwork for every film included here, & a bonus disc with special features sure to please every die-hard fan. There are no individual cases for the films here but they are fastened relatively tight by spindles which tend to overlap a bit. I'd initally feared that the individual discs could become dislodged in transit causing damage or scratches but everything was in it's proper place.Most of the discs don't offer much in the line of extras so they are basically standard issues with the usual subtitles, menu, & chapters. Overall,the quality of each movie is QUITE good but not great. In fact, some of the discs are only a tad better quality than the old vhs tapes which are hard to find these days as well. Yet again, I'm just greatful that these films are readily available so the overall picture quality may be mere small potatoes as far as I'm concerned.Nearly all the films here are deserving of the five star rating I've supplied even though I can't say that Bad Education was my all-time favorite. for some reason or another, I thought this was a bit too dark & had been hoping for a bit more madcap humor or warmth which Almodovar is generally known for. Nevertheless, Almodovar did an excellent job & Gael Garcia Bernal was phenomenal making Bad Education a worthy film to view. Unfortunately, this one is as unsentimental as it gets. I can hardly wait for the release of his latest film volver on 04/03/07. Isn't life grand? </p>

 <p> It's complicated to sum up Pedro Almodovar's Film's easily. Dark comedy, complicated families, with Hitchcock Twists! You never know what's going to happen and who's who? A master at unconventional plots! Art house film at its best! Time and time again I have learned to enjoy all these films. Spanish,Subtitled and rare to find this collection! </p>

 <p> This is a fine set, with handsome but awkward packaging (watch the spindles) and decent extras. These are the same films that made the art-house circuit before the release of "Volver." Almodovar's earlier films aren't easily found in the U.S. -- at least at your local Blockbuster -- and so we welcome "Live Flesh," "Matador" and "Law of Desire." The thriller "Matador" was last seen on laser and VHS two decades ago. It's terrific here, awash in color and black comedy, although the shock value has lost some of its power over the unruly decades.The remastered version of "Women on the Verge" doesn't feel like a big upgrade. "All My Mother's" makeover is more elegant, with fine flesh tones. "Talk to Her," "Bad Education," and "Flower" appear to be straight port-overs from the single discs already available here. In general, audio is uneven but good. Subtitles take some liberties. Unfortunately, the early '90s films "Tie Me Up!" and "Kika" aren't part of the deal. Antonio Banderas shows up in three films; Penelope Cruz is in two, but only at length in "All About My Mother." Watching these films more or less back to back is quite the rewarding experience -- you'll laugh, cry and spend a lot of time trying to figure out if you're watching a man or woman. Viva Pedro! indeed.Your mileage may vary, but I rank these films like this:1. All About My Mother2. Women on the Verge3. Matador4. Talk to Her5. Law of Desire6. Bad Education7. Flower of My Secret8. Live Flesh </p>

 <p> L'agonie silencieuse, intimit&eacute; f&eacute;rocement secr&egrave;te, le silence de deux mes des femmes f&eacute;minines prises au pi&egrave;ge dans leurs corps dormants - tous rappellent un de nos propres b&eacute;n&eacute;dictions apr&egrave;s avoir regard&eacute;  ella de contre de Hable . Les murmures doux ne peuvent pas r&eacute;sonner sans la bienveillance montr&eacute;e, l'attention par deux hommes (Benigno et Marco). Beningo est l'infirmi&egrave;re personnelle pour Alicia (comateux) pendant que Marco dirige sa propre veille masculine sur Lydia comateux (un matadoress c&eacute;l&egrave;bre a encorn&eacute; dans l'anneau &agrave; la hausse, maintenant dormant dans son lit d'hpital). F&eacute;roce est aussi l'&eacute;rotisme graphique pr&eacute;sent&eacute; dans ce drame de langue espagnol par notre sc&eacute;nariste & le directeur (Pedro Almod&oacute;var, 2002 oscar pour Sc&eacute;nario le mieux Original ; 2003 R&eacute;compense de Gant Dor&eacute;e pour le Meilleur Film d'Etranger-Langue ; la cin&eacute;matographie par Javier Aguirresarobe ; la musique par Alberto Iglesias). Le complot est intens&eacute;ment jou&eacute; dans un dans sc&eacute;nario de faon complexe romantique puissant. Les bouquets roses devraient tre distribu&eacute;s &agrave; Leonor Watlin (aussi Alicia) et Rosario Flores (que Lydia Gonz&aacute;lez) pour leurs ex&eacute;cutions complexes. Le travail superbe a &eacute;t&eacute; fait par Javier C&aacute;mara (aussi Benigno) et Dario Grandinetti (que Marco).Oui, l'intimit&eacute; extrme entoure tout le discours romantique. Et oui, le dialogue richement-textur&eacute; &eacute;l&egrave;ve le film. Nous atteignons la catharsis tr&egrave;s tt ; nos &eacute;motions sont hors tordues par II d'Acte ; nous saisissons &agrave; l'&eacute;rotisme comme si c'&eacute;tait notre chaloupe de sauvetage. Peut-tre c'est. Qui j'est de dire ? Les flash-backs transmettent &agrave; nous aimons les miroirs tourner qui clignote de retour dans le temps - l'histoire unique de chaque femme. Nous savons ces femmes comme s'ils &eacute;taient nos soeurs. Lydia mal est si encorn&eacute; qu'elle meurt dans son coma. Alicia devient enceinte pendant que comateux et a un b&eacute;b&eacute; mort-n&eacute; ; Beningo est inculp&eacute; du viol, a envoy&eacute; en prison, et se suicide plus tard - incapable de faire face &agrave; sa culpabilit&eacute;. La trag&eacute;die sup&eacute;rieure m&eacute;rite d'hautes marques. Le d&eacute;nouement est complet dans tout le respect. La passion n'est pas sacrifi&eacute;e. Le th&egrave;me complexe d'amour forc&eacute; (le viol) par Beningo sur Sylvia est directement contrl&eacute; par Almod&oacute;var sans le pr&eacute;texte. Il est arriv&eacute; ; il y a des cons&eacute;quences tragiques s&eacute;v&egrave;res &agrave; l'acte. Toutefois, il y a Sylvia d'espoir une fois elle reprend. Marco prot&egrave;ge cet espoir en ne disant pas Benigno de son r&eacute;tablissement avant son suicide. L'ironie dramatique condense devant nos yeux mmes. Agir III joue secr&egrave;tement son d&eacute;nouement, suivi par un descrescendo, alors par l'ironie subtile que c'est maintenant Marcol surveille Alicia &agrave; son concert de danse.Les applaudissements doivent aller au directeur, &agrave; la distribution, et &agrave; l'&eacute;quipage de film pour assembler une oeuvre d'art sup&eacute;rieure - qui sugg&egrave;re &agrave; tous sans exception qu'aux th&egrave;mes beaux et d&eacute;licats sont tre tenu cher - mme &agrave; ceux qui restent comateux. L'amour &eacute;tale ses ailes soyeuses o&ugrave; qu'et quand - elle d&eacute;sire si. La compassion r&eacute;sonne en ceci. La colombe palpite juste au-dessus du sc&eacute;nario pour garantir - comme dans l'Amelie de film romantique superbe (en franais, 2001) - que les h&eacute;rones poss&egrave;dent noblequalities, quand a abattu mme, qui r&eacute;v&egrave;le beaucoup de leurs mes f&eacute;minines. L'idylle pur mme dans un environnement clinique, mme pendant que les rves d'un malade pourraient tre am&eacute;lior&eacute;s par le contact avec une me gentille - devient notre connexion &agrave; cette belle histoire ; nous investissons des &eacute;motions, et le film nous r&eacute;compense. L'idylle comme une colombe dans le vol est parti sa pleur sur nous en affichant Alica dans sa pose de ballerine. Toutes les unit&eacute;s classiques ont &eacute;t&eacute; adh&eacute;r&eacute;es &agrave;. </p>

 <p> I'm so glad I bought this collection from amazon,The delivery was really fast and very well packed  in a box with protective airbags inside,just the fact of having All about my mother, Matador  and Law of desire worths the price you pay because they are really hard to find separately. I personally love all the Almodovar's movies,It would be great if High hills was included also because is missing in this collection to be perfect. It has 9 DVD total (8 movies and 1 features) and nice cards poster replicas inside of the box.The dvds are not boxed individually but the whole box is beautiful. </p>

 <p> I don't love every film in this collection.  Almodovar is too brave and experimental for every one of his films to appeal equally to all but the most devoted fans.  If you like his early, wild, anything-to-break-convention work, you may find his later work too mild or conventional.  If, like me, you find those later films deeply moving and appreciate their more mature tone, you may not be as thrilled by the early work, finding it full of guts, but lacking a bit of heart.But having these films altogether is a wonderful look into the extremely diverse work of one of the bravest and most interesting film makers of our generation.  Even the films I don't deeply love personally are full of unforgettable images, moments, pieces of acting or writing.  In a world of film that often aims for the middle, Almodovar shoots for the stars, and that's worth seeing whether you personally think an individual film gets there or not.The prices fluctuate wildly, but this set can be a good deal.  To get these 8 films seperately is going to cost you at least $80 or $90 with shipping, and some - like 'Live Flesh' - are currently out of print and overpriced themselves anyway.Also, a couple of these discs - 'All About My Mother' and 'Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown' are in upgraded form -- although there is some argument whether the upgrades are for the better.  DVD Beaver, which I find the most in depth DVD review site concludes the versions in the set ARE superior, and provide side by side images for comparison.While everyone will (and should) have very individual reactions to these complex, challenging (if often fun) films, here's my order of preference and my personal notes on the films;All About My Mother (1999) - My favorite Almodovar film to date. He finally combines the best of his older, absurdist films, with his new found maturity and real emotion that began to emerge in 'Flower of My Secret' and 'Live Flesh'.  A woman's son dies, while trying to get an autograph from a great actress, leaving his mother bereft, and trying to start a new life. I won't give away any details, but her journey is both funny and tragic, and leads to some terrifically unexpected and sometimes ironic places. Full of odd and wonderful characters, and some very strong acting. A bit cute or 'forced' in a few moments, but overall a moving, special and wonderful film. If you don't know Almodovar's work, this is an excellent place to start.Talk to Her (2002) My second favorite Almodovar film.  A moving and complex study of the relationship between two men, and their connection to women in comas. A few brilliantly funny moments, and some ultimately very creepy undertones keep it from being over-sentimental. Every character is more complex then they first appear, and the confusion between what is good and what is bad in both intent and effect is very rich. Some great camera work too. Gets slow in a few spots, and the sentiment still goes over the top in a few places, but still a terrific film about the similarities and differences between love and obsession.Live Flesh (1997) A maturing Almodovar in a less absurd - if still melodramatic - mode than his early films. This time the tone is more film noir/mystery/character study. Unlike most of the early work, this is generally `serious', with just touches of his humor. Visually very striking and dark. Wonderful performances, including an early one by Javier Bardem.  I appreciate how all the characters are grey, no one is `good' or bad'. Basically it's a love triangle with multiple angles, and a cop drama about violence and love. What it's missing (for me at least) , and keeps it a very good film, not a great one, is deeper levels of emotion. It's always interesting, but I didn't ultimately find it affecting. Also a couple of key plot contrivances are clunky - which the anarchic young Almodovar could get away with, since everything was absurd anyway. But when you're being more `real', forced twists feel more... well, forced. Still a highly enjoyable film well worth seeing, and another important step in the growth of a major filmmaker.Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (1985) Great fun, as Almodovar's visual sophistication continues to expand from film to film, and his ability to create a subtle mix of the campy, the surreal, and real emotion grows ever stronger. Full of odd and silly twists and turns, and populated by absurd but still very human characters. It's also a film with a theme - the amazing strength and resilience of women.  So why not a 5 star rating for a film a lot of smart people consider a flat-out masterpiece?. Maybe I need to re-see it a third time, but on recent round of working my way through all of Almodovar's films, it felt paper thin. I enjoyed it, but it didn't feel like a film that would stick with me, or effect me. In some ways, I found the far more flawed `Matador' has more unforgettable images, moments and challenging power. That said, this is still very worth your time. You'll smile a lot.Bad Education (2004) Fascinatingly complex nourish mystery. A film-maker is reunited with a boyhood lover, who wants to tell a dark story from their Catholic school days. But is the story true? And who's story is it really? Gael Garcia Bernal is terrific in a complicated, multi faceted role, and all the acting is very good. Gorgeously shot, with a great score.  I wish I felt more emotionally, but my mind was always completely absorbed, even if my heart stayed a little cool. Maybe that's the nature of a film where everyone is hustling and using each other.(mild spoilers ahead)A bit obvious and self-conscious in a few spots, and pederastic Catholic priests is a clich&eacute; the film only partially transcends (although the humanity given to the priest makes it far more interesting), and a couple of the climactic twists feel less motivated than what comes before. But worth it for the `Vertigo' like layers of reality that keep getting pulled back and forcing us to keep reassessing `good', `bad', `art' and `real.' Many critics consider this Almodovar's masterpiece - and I could see watching it a third time. This is the kind of film that grows on repeated viewings.Matador (1987) Almodovar meets DePalma in this dark thriller with less `jokes' than most of his films, though black humor pervades the whole thing. All the characters are obsessed with death; a murderess who kills during sex, a teacher of matadors who lives to kill, and masturbates to snuff films, and a student who wishes he could kill but faints at the sight of blood. Some of the twists are silly, obvious and/or cop-outs, and the characters never feel `real', but there are some great, operatic disturbing and funny moments as well. Sort of a thinking person's, surrealist `Fatal Attraction'. Some of it is clunky, but the film sticks with me. Very good performances all around. Most critics I respect liked it even more than me, and I'll probably re-visit it down the line.  As with many Almodovar films,  it seems like the kind of film that could easily grow on a second viewing -- its flaws more forgivable, its strengths more powerful.Flower of My Secret (1996) Sweet, and very well acted. This is much less wild and outrageous than earlier Almodovar, but compensates by having more real emotion. Still, this has two of his usual key elements -- dramatic use of intense color, and a melodramatic, almost soapy, story. It's clear he loves melodrama at the same time he gently pokes fun at it.  But in 'Flower of My Secret' the soap has more underpinnings in humanity, with subtler behavior and humor. Technically he gets even better with this film. It's beautiful, shot in a more subdued style than his earlier work. Not a great movie, but a good, entertaining, human one that paves the way to his later fully 'real' and moving masterpieces like 'Talk to Her'. Lovely performances.  There seem to be two distinct groups among Almodovar fans. Those who prefer his earlier, wilder, more genre busting work, and those who prefer his more recent, subtler films. I'm in the second group, but can completely understand those who feel differently. And where you fall on that scale is likely to have a big impact on your reaction to this film.Law of Desire (1987) Clearly a technical step forward with some stunning visuals, and solid performances.  But the melodramatic love/murder plot of a director obsessed with one man, while another is obsessed with him just got a little creaky and tiresome for me after a while.  It's not absurd  or campy enough to be funny, or real enough to raise strong emotions. </p>

 <p> Note: This release is an eight movie collection with "Volver" thrown in as a stand-alone DVD.Certainly one of the most lauded of international filmmakers, Pedro Almodovar's films can be notoriously hard to come by on the US market. Generally after an initial release, they have gone out of print and have disappeared from mainstream buying outlets. It seems strange, Almodovar is easily one of the best known and most acclaimed Spanish filmmakers in history. Having been recognized worldwide, been honored by the Oscars, and having worked with stars that have crossed into the English language film world such as Antonio Banderas and Penelope Cruz--you would think that his films would be more readily available. So, it is with delight that I welcome "Viva Pedro"--a collection of 8 films that show the colorful and dynamic world that is Pedro Almodovar. And while not a complete showcase of his larger work--I lament the exclusion of "Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down"--there is much to rejoice. This set is great for lovers of Almodovar, and priced right for new viewers who wish to get some very significant films at a reasonable cost.Starting with films from the late 80s, Almodovar uses colorful imagery and melodramatic acting to create some very personal films about love, desire and sex. Often done in an over-the-top, almost soap opera style, these films are instantly recognizable due to Almodovar's distinctive visual flair. All three films from the 80s showcase a young Banderas. "Matador" is a sly black comedy featuring an ex-bullfighter who ties death and killing with sexual excitement. "Law of Desire" is a seriocomic look at sexual desire and obsession that crosses various gender lines. And "Women On The Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown" was Almodovar's international breakthrough (and Oscar nominee for Foreign Film) that manages to be a madcap and outrageous comedy and an insightful character study.The middle films include "The Flower of my Secret"--perhaps my least favorite in the set--about a novelist who wishes to change her life at any cost. "Live Flesh" features Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz in a complex story of how violence and sacrifice can link people together. Both films are interesting, if not altogether successful.And the last three films of the set showcase a more mature side of Almodovar. The Oscar winning "All About My Mother" starts with a son's tragic death, and takes the wonderful Cecilia Roth on a spiritual journey that redefines life and her place in it. "Talk To Her" tells the story of two men who bond while their girlfriends lie in comas--this won Almodovar an Academy Award for Screenwriting and a Directing nod, as well. And "Bad Education," with Gael Garcia Bernal, is an homage to Hitchcock examining the results of religious upbringing and sexual abuse.With this box set, they have thrown in "Volver" as a stand-alone DVD.  An accomplished realist mystery about more fierce women pushed to the edge, this one boasts a great Oscar nominated turn by Penelope Cruz.  An obvious muse for the director, I had never really bought into Cruz as a leading lady until this film!Of course, anyone who knows Almodovar knows that these brief descriptions do nothing to highlight the complexity of these films. All of the films develop interesting characterizations and the way the various characters interact, combat, and collide is a showcase for the genius that is Almodovar's writing. Wildly funny, wickedly tragic, confrontationally sexual--Almodovar is an adult filmmaker working at the top of his game. Please treat yourself. Not every film is perfect, but this set in an excellent primer to the important work of a major writer and director. It's not to be missed. KGHarris, 01/07. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> A cinema-fanatical friend of mine turned me onto the works of Almodovar in the late 80s. I began with movies like "Law of Desire", "Matador",etc. his films were immediately addictive and it began my near two decade fascination with his body of work. I had owned only Super VHS ('member that videophile format?) copies of the aforementioned early titles. So to finally have them on DVD has been a wonder. My favorite Almodovar film may well be "Mala Educacion" possibly tied with "Talk to Her" and "All About My Mother". The early films turned me onto the best work that Antonio Banderas has done to date. Almodovar and Banderas is a perfect union. So to see them reunited in the new, recent "The Skin I Live In" which I now have on order once it is released on Blu-ray in a few weeks. Possibly the oddest Almodovar film to date is 1997's "Live Flesh". A launching pad for such Spanish treasures as Banderas and Penelope Cruz, I would love to see Almodovar featured all three of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s in one one movie.But until then, this Almodovar DVD boxset is something I treasure. For like the title of his most recent opus, "The Skin I Live In"........Almodovar seems to know how to peel layers away from the 'skin I live in' with his provocative, dark at times but colorful just the same celebrating life in Espana despues de Franco.(For completist, which I am, it is missing "Kika"). </p>

 <p> Love Almodovar films! These movies are very addicting and you can never guess what the ending of the film will be,It always keeps you guessing. I have to admit i just bought this series because of the movie Law of desire with antonio banderas playing gay! but i ended up loving all of them. :) </p>

 <p> After having waited a long time to get "Law of Desire" and "Matador" on DVD, I was delighted to find them included here. They're two of Almodovar's best films.  And they look great.  However, the others, with the exception of "Live Flesh" and "Bad Education", don't look as good. Particularly "Women on the Verge". As one reviewer said, it's botched pretty badly. The packaging is beautiful with nice xtras, but you have to be careful as the discs are stacked and could scratch easily. I wish they had been packaged separately. Also, "Kika" should have been included in this set (as it's out of release) to really round out the Almodovar experience. Well, just having "Matador" and "Law of Desire" makes it worth it for me. But Almodovar fans may be disappointed at the imperfections here. I was. </p>

 <p> Brilliant fimmaking, enormous vairety, lovely transfers. The material is difficult ot see. If you didn't catch these things when they were first released, you are up the creek. The theatrical reissue that was meant to promote the video release didn't last long enough for me to see but one of them. The dvds of most are out print, but I had LIVE FLESH, TALK TO HER and BAD EDUCATION on dvd and WOMEN ON THE VERGE on laser disc. But still, I had to have the set. Really terrific. got a good price at amazon Marketplace and i'm totlaly satisfied. </p>

 <p> This box-set has been too long in coming.I'm most excited about this set due to the inclusion of 'Law of Desire', which I have never seen and have not been able to find a copy of locally.Pedro's films are beautiful, messy, sad, hilarious and just about any other adjective you can think of.Those who have seen his films will no doubt add this to their collection and understand my love of anything Pedro.Those movie lovers who have not seen some or all of his work, will most definately want to add this set to their collection and I hope that they will introduce new fans to Pedro Almodovar's brilliant work!peace :o) </p>

 <p> A pretty good collection, if strangely inclusive of BAD EDUCATION, a recent film, with the older batch of films, mainly of 1980s.  This could be because LAW OF DESIRE's film director character is a forerunner of the film director in the later film.  The problem is in reviewing the collection or the individual films.  For instance, there are 3 documentaries on the filmmaker included on an extra disk.  Otherwise the movies are presented w/English subtitle options but no extras, except for one of them.Almodovar's style as a whole is for wildly improbable plots involving situations and characters that run of the mill people would never experience.  American film reviewers love this, as they love French farce, and so give these films a free pass, awarding a blue ribbon.  The true question is whether the same films would be as highly reviewed if the identical screenplay were presented as a solely American product.Almodovar's film staples include (on the 8 films represented in this package):  (1)  Penelope Cruz going into labor (ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER; LIVE FLESH).  (2)  The homely guy is always slick, a real winner, at least professionally, and sometimes a film director (BAD EDUCATION; LAW OF DESIRE).  (3)  There's always strained theatrical moments, such as presentations of A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, that take up much screen time, and often are comical without being meant to be.  Ditto a usage of older films that his characters seem to be greatly influenced by.  (4)  The cute guy, who in real life would probably be greatly sought after as a romantic partner, is always a loser who becomes obsessed with another person or thing to the detriment of everything else (LIVE FLESH; LAW OF DESIRE; BAD EDUCATION).  (5)  Usage of FF nudity is primarily male.  (6) Everyone in the world (or at least Spain) is personally acquainted with a transexual or transvestite.Briefly, on the films themselves, ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER is a tear-jerker that goes to extremes and unfortunately goes on way too long.  Good acting, but improbable characters and their life histories make this film an experience to endure.BAD EDUCATION has the superlative Gael Garcia Bernal in it, and is also a blatant indictment of the Catholic Church's methods.  The twists and turns in the plot make it worthwhile as well as uniformly good performances.  Unusual film from this director, who usually focusses more on the women. For those squeamish of homosexual content, this film is not nearly as explicit as LAW OF DESIRE.LAW OF DESIRE has the young Antonio Banderas seducing/seduced by a film director whom he is obsessed with.  There is FF nudity from Banderas and others.  Rather interesting, not quite a thriller, but an ending that brings the story-line full circle in a way.  Rather a moral on how what you're looking for may be staring you in the face but you have to be prepared to take it.  I found the plot weak whenever it got into the ancillary characters, as they were unnecessary to the main plot but presumably there to soften the main character of the film director.LIVE FLESH is an unbelievable situation of a young man from prison subsequently having affairs with two police officers' (one of whom he'd shot and crippled) wives.  Unfortunately this plot was wholly predictable though improbable.  Too many cliches of drunken criminal cop abusing wife, etc.  At times seems it was meant to be a music video, and should have been, with pop songs used as narrative.TALK TO HER, generally considered one of the more popular Almodovar films, and a quiet, sincere character piece.  I could easily have lived without the scene of the shrunken man interacting with a woman's nude body; that was outrageous for the fun of it, I guess.  But from what appeared to be a would-be homosexual union between two men veered in another direction that also made the ending quite believable.  It set up cliches only to knock them down.WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN has provided me an obsession with gazpacho that has haunted me to this day.  I didn't watch it again via this collection, but realized I have no memories of the film from first seeing it, except that it was fun; so that tells me nothing of the plot is essential, and I probably didn't identify with the characters.THE FLOWER OF MY SECRET is weird, as it takes off from the scenario of ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER, which isn't a good thing.  It's about a writer's crisis, this time her own self-conceit being played out on a public stage, as she is both a well known author but also writes under a pseudonyn attacking her own work.  Meanwhile, her marriage is falling apart.  So she's really a woman having an identity crisis, as an artist, and as a woman.  Maybe it takes a person who's undergone an identity crisis to understand this one.MATADOR can be summed as "Can two serial killers find happiness in death with each other?"  Add Banderas as a sexually confused young man who appears to have occasional perfect-radar psychic abilities and a young woman who's been sexually assaulted three times and is quite casual about it, and a closeted gay detective, and a psychiatrist who wants to seduce basically anybody, and you pretty much have a would-be psychology thriller very confused about what's going on.  The film has the confusion one would expect from a wholly improvisational piece, like the director was making it up as they went along in the filming.  I am blinded by the idea any of these characters would even exist in real life, except for the detective, so find it amazing they'd actually be stumbling into each other's orbit.  A fun movie to spend some time on, as it is an entertaining mix of psychological motivations and I guess you can breathe easy nobody like this lives on your block. </p>
