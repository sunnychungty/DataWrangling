 <p> LOVED this book! Such a heartwarming, touching story about family. This story is about Heath and his dad and their travels back to Massachusetts to live at the Inn. The story has some very interesting characters. I loved how well the characters were written - especially Preacher with his accent. Every time I picked up this book I was brought right into the story and could picture myself as a fly on the wall watching everything happen. It was like I was following Heath around learning as he did. The characters make it such a warm story that makes you realize that 'family' can be a variety of things. I could definitely see this story becoming a movie. It was so enjoyable to read and I think it'd be a shame to not have it on film. It's a good story that the whole family can enjoy. A+Tim Whitney - if this is your debut, I can't wait to see what comes out next! Thank you for the read! </p>

 <p> Book Review - Thanksgiving at the Inn </p>


<h2> review.date </h2>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> In all honesty, I'm not really sure where to begin with this review, and I don't mean that in a bad way. I loved and adored every aspect and each character in Thanksgiving at the Inn. Geared toward middle school aged readers, I wholeheartedly believe that this is a story for adults as well. While reading Thanksgiving at the Inn, I was reminded, repeatedly, of the style of writing of Richard Paul Evans. This is actually saying quite a bit on my part, considering that Richard Paul Evans is one of my favorite authors, who never ceases to touch my heart. Tim Whitney is most definitely in that league, in my opinion. His story, Thanksgiving at the Inn, touches the heart, quickly engulfs the reader within the story and in the end delivers a very valuable lesson that everyone should remember. This is also a story that is not easily forgotten and will remain with the reader, long after the final word is read.Young Heath Wellington III has not had an easy time of it. His mother left a while ago, his father isn't the nicest, nor happiest of people, and now Heath has been suspended from school for cheating - which he did not do. Life just seems to continue to throw curve balls to Heath. When the sudden and tragic death of his estranged Grandfather, Heath Senior, occurs, Heath and his father travel to Whately, Massachusetts to fulfill the requirements of Senior's will - to successfully manage Senior's Bed and Breakfast, The Sleeping Inn, for the next three months. This includes cleaning up and caring for the property as well as the occupants, four very different, but wonderful people. Each person has their own tragic story, however each has also learned the important lesson of being thankful for what they have and the second chances they have been given. Winsted, Mustang Sally, Carter and Mrs. Ferrel quickly embrace Heath, and he them, providing that family feeling that he has been so lacking.Heath and his father are like two bulls, constantly butting heads. His father constantly lashing Heath with verbal abuse. When Heath saves a young autistic girl from certain death, his father becomes eruptively enraged. This leads to a tragic accident that changes both their lives forever.Mr. Whitney does such a fantastic job bringing his characters to life and really making the reader care deeply for them. Heath is an exceptional young man whom I adored. His personality and strength are beyond admirable and to be commended, especially considering all that he has been through and has to deal with on a day-to-day basis. Winsted, the Jamaican resident of the house, is brutally wise and honest and such a delight to get to know. He is the chef of the house and seemingly the most in charge of everything that takes place. The other character that I really loved was Mustang Sally. This is a big, buff, tattooed man who has a heart of gold. Each and every character is fabulous, in their own way, and play an equally important role within Thanksgiving at the Inn (Yes, even the father who you just want to thunk every now and again).Through tragedy, comes understanding, hope and thankfulness. Thanksgiving at the Inn is a story that will bloom within the reader's heart, making it the perfect read for this time of year, or anytime. It is touching, beyond words, inspirational and impossible to put down.I do want to address the age level this is geared toward and set forth a slight warning. Thanksgiving at the Inn is written for middle school age children (ages 9-12), however there is some inappropriate language. Parents who are sticklers for this may want to be warned. However it is slight and in no way offensive or crude. That being said, I truly feel that adults will revel in this book as well. What a great way to share and get closer with your child, by reading and discussing this story. Though Thanksgiving at the Inn does focus around a young boy, Heath, I feel that this in no way targets the male reader. Rather, it is written in a wonderfully universal way that male, female, young adults and adult will enjoy.Thanksgiving at the Inn is a must read. It is guaranteed to warm your heart and bring hope alive. </p>

 <p> Relationships, family, forgiveness, gratitude, happiness - those themes play a central part in Thanksgiving at the Inn, Tim Whitney's heartwarming story for middle grade and young teen readers. Heath, the main character, clashes daily with his father (Junior), a withdrawn alcoholic and struggling author/carpenter. With no mother in sight, Heath does his best to abide by his father's wishes and rules but ends up getting constantly berated, always running short of his father's expectations. Junior has a hard time relating to his son, haunted by past experiences with his own father, Senior, the patriarch of the family. When Senior dies, both father and young son receive even more unsettling news. In order to inherit the family estate, they must move to back to the homestead in Massachusetts and manage Senior's unusual farmhouse bed and breakfast for three months. Things get even more interesting when they meet the current tenants, a strange group of individuals. As they adjust to the change, another tragedy forces them to consider reconciliation and, ultimately, they both grow, change and learn how to be thankful for what they have.Whitney's debut novel fills a much needed void. This character building book with wholesome messages is perfect to share with tweens/teens, both boys and girls. Thanksgiving at the Inn would also make an excellent family read-aloud, offering the following compelling discussion topics: alcoholism, autism, death, dyslexia and strained father-son relationships. The characters and plot appeal to both young and old. While it isn't exactly action packed, the coming-of-age story contains several enticing characters including a wise Jamaican man named Winsted and Mustang Sally, a tattoo-covered auto mechanic who also writes and illustrates children's books. I found only a couple minor issues with the book, both due to layout--the narrow margins may turn off some younger readers and the book cover may appeal more to adults than it would kids. Even though Thanksgiving at the Inn does take place at Thanksgiving, this isn't necessarily only a holiday read. The life lessons in the book apply to any time of the year - after all, we should be thankful every single day for what and whom we have in our lives!

 <p> Heath Wellington III and his father, Heath Wellington Junior are having a hard time communicating with each other, especially since his mother left and his father won't listen to him. Heath has been suspended from school but it wasn't his fault. Of course his father doesn't believe him. Heath can't wait till he can leave home.When they receive new that Heath Wellington Senior has passed away and in order to claim their fortune they have to run the bed and breakfast that Senior left behind for three months, otherwise they can kiss their fortune good bye. Heath has never known his grandfather. His father was estranged with his own father and couldn't wait to get away. After they arrive at the B&B;, they meet a group of very interesting characters.Thanksgiving at the Inn is author, Tim Whitney's debut novel. This had a nice story to it as well as some interesting characters. Though of all the characters in this book, I didn't really have a favorite. This is because no one engaged me that much. Something good about Thanksgiving at the Inn was that it did portray a good message that life is too precious to hold onto grudges. </p>

 <p> Heath Wellington the III is a confused and sad child with an embittered father who is fighting his own demons of alcoholism, rejection by his former wife and alienation from his own father.The cast of characters who teach Heath III how to understand his father reconcile with his father and Heath Junior to cope with his, are finely drawn and unforgettable.I strongly recommend this novel and look forward to Tim Whitney's next one.Diana Hockley </p>

 <p> Thanksgiving at the Inn is a heartwarming tale where the central characters not only learn from each other but also themselves.  I enjoyed watching the progression both remaining Wellington's made as each navigated their way through complex relationships.  I found the struggle for the father and son to bond after the loss of Heath's mother and Junior's father believable and honest.While I was disappointed in the elder Heath's emotional abandonment of his son at a critical juncture of life it drove the story with great impact.  I found it interesting to watch Junior replay and relive the sins of his father with his own son.  His behavior and actions echoed those that were perpetrated against him long ago and he still didn't have the common sense to look through his own pain to make it better for his own child.  The fact that he continued to be so spiteful towards Senior (despite the man no longer being present) made it more believable that his own son did his best to be the better man.I adored the youngest Heath as the central character.  Despite some challenging circumstances and situations his reactions and behavior were far more dignified than a typical boy his age.  He was so well mannered and caring, love starved even, as he built relationships with the Inn-habitants and other members from town that he interacted with.  He was not without his faults but was honest about them and did his best to become a better person.Whitney built a wonderful cast of characters in the Inn-habitants.  The diversity of their lives allowed Heath to experience different life lessons through each.  Even better, the author did well to showcase each individual and their life story without side-tracking the all encompassing plot  by focusing too much on any.  They were all a means to an end not the main story.If you are looking for a light, quick read about family dynamics and growing as a person then Whitney's Thanksgiving at the Inn is a wonderful selection to add to your shelves. </p>

 <p> Heartwarming Family Drama </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> Two years ago the mother of teenager Heath Wellington III walked out on him and his dad Junior.  Since she left, Junior treats his son as a slave with chores all the time when the kid is not in school, which he is not having been suspended for cheating.  When Junior's dad dies, Heath realizes he cannot remember what his grandfather Senior looked like as they drive to Massachusetts for the funeral.  Senior's lawyer Lloyd explains that Junior and Heath will inherit the Sleeping Inn if they run the place for three months and take care of the residents.Heath feels at home at the B&B; with the Jamaican sage Winsted, elderly Mrs. Farrel who is giving away her late husband's fortune one letter at a time, muscular children's author Mustang Sally, and TV news couch potato Carter.  He also likes neighbor Savannah who apparently is his dad's first love, and her autistic daughter Tori.  On the other hand he loathes his father who sees the world as one endless loveless chore.This is an engaging inspiring family drama as the son becomes the father (think of Chapin's song Cat in the Cradle) although Senior learned too late what he did to his offspring.  Senior's legacy is letters trying to reach Junior before he repeats the mistake with the III.  In light of a photo showing three generations of smiling male Wellingtons, the lack of the back story between Senior and Junior hurts any transformation that may occur.  Still fans will enjoy this fine holiday tale as everyone learns to be thankful for all the good in their lives by celebrating together THANKSGIVING AT THE INN.Harriet Klausner </p>

 <p> Heath is a delightful, thoughtful boy who struggles with finding his place in life.  He craves his father's love, but all Junior can seem to do is criticize and neglect him.  Like many fathers and sons, Heath and Junior butt heads and can't seem to get along, andJunior's own struggle with alcoholism and finding his own place in life, doesn't help the situation.  Once Heath and his father arrive at the inn, however, Heath finds the family he's always dreamed about having, even as his own father grows more distant.  The other residents take him in and, from them, he begins to learn about love and gratitude, and even begins to understand his father a little better.I think that this is a terrific book to read any time of year, but it's particularly heartwarming to read during the holidays when gratitude and family are at the forefront of people's lives.  While the target audience is middle school age, it is certainly a book for all ages.  I loved Heath and Winstead and Sally.  I found the characters fairly well developed and certainly likeable.  Some might say the story is predictable, but I loved the lessons that Heath and his father learned:  the true meaning of gratitude; that family is important; and being there for someone else really just might make a difference.This was a charming novel and a terrific debut for Tim Whitney. </p>

 <p> As an adult, when reading a children's book you often have to keep the author's intended audience in mind. With Thanksgiving at The Inn I didn't have to try so hard. Young, Heath Wellington III has had a difficult time since his mother left him and his father. His father, Junior is a struggling single father, aspiring writer and an alcoholic. When Heath's grandfather dies, Heath and his father go to Massachusetts to run the Bed and Breakfast that will be left to them in the will, if they meet the strict requirements.This book brings to light the age old father and son struggle. A parent always wants the best for their children and so they guide them but for some parents the guidance is sometimes a push in the other direction. I wonder if young minds will be able to pick up on the subtle themes and suggestions of this novel? I am by no means saying that it is too subtle or not suggestive enough. I am more wondering at the power of the young mind.This is a wonderful book that I could see turning into a timeless classic. </p>

 <p> First off I want to congratulate Tim Whitney for an outstanding novel. It was one of the best books I have read in a long while. I was lucky enough to receive an ARC of this novel for review and enjoyed it so much! The different characters at the Inn were so entertaining and just different! Winsted, the old and wise Jamaican guy; Mrs. Farrel, the elderly woman who was giving away her late husband's fortune; Mustang Sally, the tough guy who is an author and illustrator of a children's book; Carter, the T.V. junkie who in reality graduated from Harvard in the top three of his class; Junior (Heath's father), an author who is constantly rejected; and last but not least, Heath, who doesn't know who he is. This book goes through Heath's journey into finding himself. There were a lot of things in this book I loved! First off, I loved how he explained "Secret Garden". I've actually never thought about it like that before. He explains it as, everyone has secrets and they plant them in a garden, you keep them planted long enough and they'll rot. When I read that quote, it literately gave me chills because it's just so true! The other thing that struck me the most was the "Three Types of People" as Sally explained. Those that make things happen, those that watch things happen and those that wonder what the heck just happened. As I read this book, I kept thinking about the relationship between Heath and his father; it started making me think about my relationship with my mother. This is just one of those books that makes appreciate the things you have. Like with Savannah, her daughter is autistic and her husband had an affair. She could see past her husband's betrayal and her daughter's condition because of the unconditional love she has for her daughter. Even though bad things happen, it doesn't mean that you should stop everything. Or if your novel keeps getting rejected, it doesn't mean you should stop trying. This book was a really great read! I give it 4 paws out of 5! </p>

 <p> Thanksgiving at the Inn turned out to be the perfect feel good read for me right now. I received the book earlier this summer from Bancroft Press but didn't get a chance to read until last night. It turned out to be perfect fall reading and to get me ready for the Holidays that are quickly sneaking up on me.Heath Wellington III has been suspended from school for cheating, his father is a sometime alcoholic and a struggling writer and his grandfather just died. Life isn't easy but things begin to change when he and his father make the trip to Massachusetts to take over ownership of Senior's Inn. Heath and his father find the kindness of others and family in a new place and are able to begin healing their relationship right in time for Thanksgiving.A wonderfully, sweet story of families and love. A great group of characters that keeps it interesting throughout. I never knew who else I would be meeting and what their secret would be. Loved it. I look forward to more young adult books from TIm Whitney.Thanksgiving at the Inn came out on October 1st. </p>

 <p> Perfect Holiday Read </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> Thanksgiving at the Inn is an easy, enjoyable read that is not only perfect for the holiday season, but any time of the year. While on some levels I felt that this story could pass for middle grade reading (except for some mild profanity), it is a story that really anyone of any age can appreciate. This story reminds us the importance of being thankful for what we have--and that it's important to remember that at all times, not simply when tragedy strikes.In my opinion, the writing is generally solid, though the plot may be a tad predictable and some of the characters could stand to be fleshed out a little more--particularly Heath's father. What I did enjoy was the variety of characters we see--the synopsis sums them up nicely, and they make for an interesting premise. Some elements of the plot may not seem believable, such as Junior's transformation after his accident, but I think the real importance of this book is the message that Whitney is trying to send. While all of the serious issues are dealt with on a superficial level, that does help to keep the read a little easier for those young adults out there that Whitney is targeting.If you are looking for a book that is a quick read with a message of gratitude, then you might considering giving Thanksgiving at the Inn a try. </p>

 <p> Thanksgiving at the Inn was definitely a feel good kind of book for me. Heath is having a tough time living with his dad who is not easy at all to be around and his mother is out of the picture. Because of him, he never really got to know his grandfather. So when the chance comes (through his grandfather's will) to learn more about his Grandfather, Heath is sort of interested in this opportunity but knows his dad sure isn't.I love the cast of characters we meet at his grandfather's inn. Winsted who basically runs the inn and is friendly to all, Mrs Farrel a mysterious old woman, Mustang Sally, who is multi-talented, and Carter the reluctant Harvard graduate. They all bring something to the story and teach Heath about his family and how you don't have to be related to be a family. I personally loved Winsted and Mustang Sally, they both had hearts of gold!The author really covers a lot of ground dealing with things such as grief, guilt, alcoholism, autism, and love among other things. I thought it was fitting to frame the story around the Thanksgiving season. The author really created a heartwarming story of redemption. Overall a heartwarming and hopeful story! </p>

 <p> Young Heath Wellington III doesn't get along with his father, which isn't a surprise because Heath's father doesn't get along with his father (Heath's grandfather) either. Now Heath Sr. has passed away and left an odd request for his son Heath Jr. to follow, or he doesn't get any inheritance. The will mentions an Inn that the grandfather owned, and he wants his son and grandson to live at the Inn and take care of the animals and people that come with it.This story is told through the eyes of the younger Heath. He makes new friends and tries to understand his father and himself. Even though the book has Thanksgiving in the title, it does not have to be read during Thanksgiving. It's a heartwarming story with charming characters for any season. </p>

 <p> Thanksgiving At The Inn was a timely read that I had intentionally left for Thanksgiving weekend to read.  I enjoyed 12 year old Heath as the narrator of the book.  I think this perspective really added to what this book was and I can not really imagine what it would have been read like if it would have been told from Jr's perspective.  Author Tim Whitney made a smart choice when he wrote the book this way and it really made me think how books can totally change when told by a different character.A smooth easy read, I found the book lite and at the same time the subject line had an inner deepness that I found surprising and appreciated as an adult.  I guess what I am saying is that while this book would be a good read for a younger person, I didn't find it too simply written.  The characters were good fits with the book and I enjoyed learning that each one had a bit of quirkiness.  For a young person reading this book I think these characters are a good way to remind us not to judge someone and that you really don't always know what a person has going on inside.Over all a good read that I really enjoyed. </p>

 <p> THANKSGIVING AT THE INN tells the story of three generations of Heath Wellingtons: Senior, Junior, and Heath III.Heath and his father, Junior, are living a hand-to-mouth life in New Jersey when they receive word that Senior has died. With Heath suspended from school and Junior trying to write a novel, Heath is disheartened by the harsh way his father treats him.The two head for the Sleeping Inn, the Wellington home turned bed-and-breakfast, to attend the funeral and hear the reading of the will. What awaits them is an Inn filled with a collection of misfits that Senior has "collected" over the years and tried to help.A rough relationship between Junior and Senior led Senior to will Junior the Inn with several conditions. Junior does not want to abide by those stipulations; he wants only the money to pay the bills while he writes a novel.Full of quirky characters, the "Inn-habitants" become the supportive and loving family that Heath has missed since his mother left them. A Jamaican preacher, a tattooed mechanic, and an eccentric old woman hold the power to turn the Inn and the money over to Junior if he follows the terms of the will to their satisfaction.THANKSGIVING AT THE INN is a story that young-adult boy readers will be able to identify with. Heath is a kid in trouble at school and home. His father is hard on him without reason. Heath must learn that he doesn't know everything about his father. Maybe his father's reasons for living his life the way he does, while not always right, can be understood.It takes losing the grandfather that he never knew for Heath to be able to connect with his father.Reviewed by:  Kelley Burrow </p>
