 <p> The author is a self-described "specialist in romantic travel" who has been visiting the Caribbean for over twenty years.  The recommendations in this book are based on that experience.  Typically, there's a brief general description of a location, a photo, and a hotel recommendation.  This is a short, introductory book that may be useful for stimulating some interesting vacation possibilities. </p>

 <p> What could be better than getting advice about romantic getaways than from The Romance Lady. I like everything about this book -- I was hooked by the cover. This is a well-organized book for those looking to get away from it all. The Romance Lady does not just give you places to go but reasons to go there. She also supplies links to more information should you want to do a little of your own digging.If you are heading for the Caribbean, get this book. </p>

 <p> If you're like me, married for a while and creatively thinking of things to do, or places to go to spice it up. Then this book comes as a welcomed surprise. It exposed me to a myriad of options and places to go via the Caribbean Islands. I could actually imagine being on one of the secluded sandy beaches, slipping pina coladas and listening to the peaceful waves lap against the shore.It's a great book to get those dusty ideas off of Hawaii and on to something fresh.... </p>

 <p> Written by a romantic holiday expert, this book presents information about several islands in a concise format. f you are going to the Caribbean, this book will give you some great information about what you will find in the different locations. Sometimes a large book has too much information to wade through and you don't have time to find what you really need to enjoy yourself. That is where a shorter ebook like this can really help. If you are planning a romantic holiday in the Caribbean this ebook will help you choose what to look for and which places to look into. Happy holidays! </p>
