 <p> I enjoyed this movie overall, its clearly a silly farce--but I wasn't expecting anything less from this movie with the Elvii.  Elvis plays Josh (a military guy) who thanks to his roots in the same area as a mountain the army wants to build a missle launcher on, is recruited to convince the family that owns the mountain to lease it to the government.  Up until this time the family (about as hickville as they could make them) has been chasing off government people with guns.Josh shows up and is instantly mistaken for Jody the blond Elvis, that gets fixed and Jody does not like Josh.  Jody seems to have a pretty small part actually, he is a bit more of a bum than Josh--it seems, even Ma and Pa depend on Josh in their times of crisis that happen in this film, instead of their own son, Jody. (Really Jody is a bit of a cad, as he foists himself upon a pretty military girl--litterly running her resistance into the ground)The most memorable song for me, was the the one song Elvis didn't sing, Ma's lament of Pa (who has dissapeared on a possum hunt).  Elvis did a good job and I enjoyed his songs, but none of them are oustanding numbers.I was pretty amused how inspite of this being set in the mountains that somehow (government paid for them in an attempt to win the family over) all of the girls end up in bikinis.  Yes! I want to run around the woods in a bikini, nothing like a little deer tick or poison ivy.A fun and amusing film. </p>

 <p> If you thought that IT HAPPENED AT THE WORLD'S FAIR was a weak picture, wait until you see THIS one!For some reason, they had Elvis play two roles in this picture: a black-haired city boy and a blond haired  hillbilly. It was an idea that having two Elvises would certainly create  big box office numbers.The storyline is quite trite, the black haired  Elvis tries to convince a family (in which the blond Elvis belongs) to let  them use their property for some army-related project.The funny thing  is, while Elvis plays two roles in this picture, he isn't really shown any  more than in any other picture. Most scenes feature either the black haired  Elvis or the blond haired Elvis.The songs in this picture are fair to  poor. The only real standout is the quite nice &quot;Tender Feeling&quot;.  On the other hand, there's &quot;Barefoot Ballad&quot;, one of the worst  Elvis movie songs of all time.KISSIN' COUSINS is hard to sit through in  some parts, but it's still better than some of the pictures to come, namely  TICKLE ME and HARUM SCARUM. </p>

 <p> For fans, this is a romp with Elvis playing a dual role.  Unfortunately, the storyline itself is corny and the girls scantily clad simply for effect.  Thus, the &#34;low&#34; rating.  Nevertheless, it is a must have for collectors of the Kings films. </p>

 <p> Elvis with blond hair?  Less than memorable songs.  Not to mention an Elvis who is less than in his prime.  Incest is never a good thing.  The only things that should be kept in the family are mafia business and heirlooms.That said, in a way, it's a creative Elvis movie.  He plays a dual role.All in all, however, I recommend avoiding this if possible.  If you want to see Elvis, try something better, like Clambake.That's all. </p>

 <p> Of the "33 movies" Elvis made (though some were documentaries), this was among the worst. I liked Harem Scarum better. I liked this more than Stay Away Joe. That's where this movie falls.The music? The saving grace of most Elvis movies? Bah! Ugh! What an awful movie for music. What in the World were these song writers SMOKIN'? These songs are really, really bad.You'll watch this movie because you like looking at Elvis, and he makes any song seem a lot better than it really is. But even when Elvis elevates these songs, they still don't rise above being clunkers.Oh wait. There is a bright spot to this movie, and the reason why it received two glorious stars: Yvonne Craig. Land B'Goshen, she is HOT!!!! And the good news is, Elvis makes out with her! Yeah, baby! When you're a guy, you want to be like Elvis. If you're like Elvis and you have your choice of women, you choose Yvonne Craig. What a bod. Yummilicious.Yvonne Craig in a bikini is worth watching this movie. And seeing Elvis. The movie itself really, really stinks. Too bad Craig wasn't in more Elvis pictures. I would've rather seen her as the leading lady in Tickle Me and Roustabout. </p>

 <p> I bought this movie so I can work on my Elvis collection and I watched it for the first time in a very long time and I forgot how cheesy it is. I'm completely aware of the time that the movie was shot but come on. If MGM could make a pink bubble turn into the Good Witch of the North in the 1930's, then they could find a way to put two Elvis's in the same scene in the 1960's. When the dark haired one was in a shot, the other wasn't there or he was turned around so you couldn't see his face. It also wasn't hard to tell that when the two of them were in the same shot, one was a total &quot;look-alike&quot;. I gave it 3 stars because the movie wasn't his best but it's Elvis. In my book, no one can sing or move the way he could. I don't think someone could look as beautiful as he did on screen either. I'm a HUGE Elvis fan, but this movie is just cheap compared to a couple of his others. </p>

 <p> Was a great movie to watch. Seeing Elvis as a blonde was very interesting as well. I really enjoyed the film and found myself being interested in how they had got him to play 2 people at the same time since they wouldn't have had the things to do it digitally in the days when Elvis was making films. The film was worth the buy and added to my already big collection of Elvis movies, I was really happy with the film. </p>

 <p> I enjoy this movie every time I watch it. I have been viewing it since it first came out many years ago. It's one of those movies that the whole family can watch and enjoy.Today you can be an idiot and become a movie star. You don't have to do much but use four letter words at the right time. Those people that aren't very bright or don't have a very good hold on the language can be a movie star. The era that this movie of Kissin Cousins was made there were many Academy Award movies that did not use vulger language in them. It seems stupidity reigns supreme today. Thanks.John </p>

 <p> This movie is an Elvis Presley hillbilly versus military nonsense musical comedy, so it's just great fun to relax and watch.I especially liked one of the songs that he sings, "TENDER FEELING", so I learned to sing it, recorded it, and posted my homemade amateur video recording at the YOU TUBE web site, and on my own personal web site, "OUR ETERNAL STRUGGLE".There's also a particularly amusing episode with the family hound accompanying the matriarch as she wails her lament. </p>

 <p> "Kissin Cousins" is another film that is considered, by popular opinion to be a cheeseball. You have to try this film first and see what you think. If you like it and recommend it write a review here. I'd like to add that Elvis movie fans better listen up! If you like any of his films, POST A REVIEW FOR PETE'S SAKE! I see only 5+ reviews for his movies. Disappointing! In fact I see it on all products that's Elvis except the 30 #1 Hits CD which has 205+. MUCH BETTER! Finally we wised up on that one. Getting back to "Kissin' Cousins", Elvis does double duty and plays an air force pilot named Josh Morgan (my name, except for the Morgan part) and his hilbilly blonde look-alike Jodie Tatum. I'm still wondering how this film was done with two Elvis on the screen at once in some scenes. I agree with the person who said that Yvonne Craig should have been in more of Elvis' pictures. She's a hot potato. Again, give this one a try and rely on what your thoughts tell you. Elvis is still the King no matter what type of picture he's in. This one is pretty good, overall. </p>

 <p> I realize that Elvis movies are not to be taken seriously --  mindless fun.  However, this movie was simply the corniest, silliest movie I've ever seen.  I watched with my whole family and no one liked it.  It was painful to watch.  I'm not a huge Elvis movie buff so I can't compare to his other movies, but I can say it fell far short of Elvis' Jailhouse Rock.  I purchased this DVD after reading all of the positive reviews.  I'm really stunned at how many people have given this a strong rating.  It's not only silly, but it's extremely BORING. </p>

 <p> Considered his weakest flick at the time, KC lands in 2K with a fairly low  EMBARRASSMENT FACTOR of 3 (of 10), attributed to a typically congenial  Presley, some bouyant tunes, and a generally happy atmosphere (despite the  reported 18-day shooting schedule). Careful post-production musical  deletions and reduction of running time would have helped. (Rating is a  high-2). </p>

 <p> I have to strongly disagree with those who rate the music in this Elvis movie as "really bad". Actually, the movie has several "really good" ballads. Admittedly, "Barefoot Ballad" can go in the trash heap, but songs like "Tender Feeling", "Catchin' on Fast", "One Boy Two Little Girls" and one that has been cut from my copy of the VHS, "Anyone" are great songs. The movie also features two of the great character actors of their time, Oscar winner Jack Albertson and frequent Elvis co-star, Arthur O'Connell. Both do great jobs in their roles, especially O'Connell playing Elvis' folksy mountain cousin. I got a kick out of those reviewers who hated Elvis as a blond in this movie when any true Elvis fan knows that his actual hair color was more blond than black. </p>

 <p> The Elvis movie formula takes time off from the usual frolic on sandy beaches, and shifts to Hillbilly Heaven. For those who just can't get enough Elvis, he plays a dual role in this movie. The comedy is lighthearted, and maybe even a little light-headed. The music is the '60s pop rock fluff typical of Elvis'  flicks. Some of the movie extras look as if they are practicing for an appearance on TV's &quot;Hee Haw.&quot; The fussin', feudin', and fightin' is all in good fun. The sparkin' that passes for romance up in the hills is &quot;G&quot; rated, of course. The military wants to put an intercontinental ballistic missile on Walton's mountain, er, the Tatum family property. Air Force officer Josh Morgan (Elvis) is ordered to help acquire the missile site because he is a distant cousin of the Tatums. Josh's lookalike cousin Jody (Elvis in a blonde wig) resents the intrusion. It seems all government men are suspect because they might be &quot;revenuers.&quot; When Josh uses the phrase &quot;ICBM&quot; to Pappy Tatum (Arthur O'Connell), Pappy replies, &quot;You do? Where?&quot; Shades of Abbott and Costello. This is far from the greatest movie ever made, but it's okay light entertainment. Aging baby boomers can relish the nostalgia. Knock yourself out. Enjoy the nonsense. </p>

 <p> This film doesn't get the notoriety of Jailhouse Rock or Viva Las Vegas, but is still a pretty entertaining film with great songs and lots of Elvis and Yvonne Craig (Batgirl from the Batman TV series).  Elvis looks great, and seem to be enjoying himself in this movie.  Although it probably won't be considered his best film, it's still very worthwhile.  Lots of funny scenes, great music, good acting. </p>

 <p> Elvis Presley's first truly bad movie. Produced by low-rent Sam Katzman, &#34;Kissin' Cousins&#34; (1964) saddles the King with a sitcom-level script, forgettable songs and cheap sets. Presley and the supporting players try their best, but it's a hopeless situation. Not surprisingly, Elvis hated his contrived dual role and the blond wig. </p>

 <p> How much mun fun do you want, got Elvis Presley staring in a movie, you see him in love, and sining too. But how about another Elvis Presley. Believe it or not, Elvis Presley is playing to characters in this movie. I am giving this movie 4 stars because, there was one minor problem I had with this movie. There is a scene in movie when Josh Morgan (Elvis Presley) is willing to help Ma Tatum  when Pa Tatum is missing, and he does that after sh treats him. Earlier in this movie, when Soble promises the girls gifts on from the army, and they become to lazy to do they chores, Ma Tatum orders Josh and all the rest of the army of the mountain. If she treated me like that, and she needed help I would not help her and I would her &quot;because of the way you treated me and my army, you can do it yourself&quot; relative or not. I have also remembered that there is one song in this movie that is not sung by Elvis and that is &quot;Pappy won't you please come home&quot;. </p>
