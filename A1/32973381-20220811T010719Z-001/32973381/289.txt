<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> This film is extremely well acted, and the cinematography is amazingly impressive. The opening scene of Act III at Christmastime would itself make a charming lithograph or holiday greeting card.  The legendary music of such icons as Roy Orbison and the entertaining drag shows featuring impersonations of artists such as transsexual vocalist Romy Haag and others really gave the film a quick paced feel.Most heartwarming was the wonderful love story between the 2 main characters, Frank and Jake, which was sadly overshadowed by Jake contracting AIDS. The support, respect, and unconditional love shown to Jake by his friends and lover as his disease progresses moved me beyond words. And no surprise here---Stephen Fry(star of the phenomenal movie, "Wilde") gives a wonderful performance as Jake's caring physician, Dr.Marsh.I selfishly wish the movie had focused a little more on developing the love story between the 2 main characters rather than on the hospital scenes and agonizing progression of Jake's suffering.  However, I respect Writer/Director Jean-Claude Schlim's technical decisions because all in all this is a truly great contribution to gay cinema. It's a movie that has it all----homoerotic passion, unconditional love, superb acting, technical excellence, and a beautiful love story and tragic drama--- all coming to a bittersweet conclusion when Frank and Jake's former girlfriend, Carol, embark on a pilgrimage of sorts to Morocco to scatter Jake's ashes and fulfill Jake's dream of seeing the exotic land associated with Jimi Hendrix's legacy.  The beautiful young singer, Nyco Lilliu closes the film with a heart wrenching rendition of "La-bas" ("Somewhere")/"Quelqu'un" ("Someone")  Songwriter Cyril Collard himself is heard singing the English version during the closing credits.This is the type of movie that is worth owning, sharing, embracing, treasuring, and celebrating for the truly splendid masterpiece that it is. Along with "Beautiful Thing" and  "Shelter", "House of Boys" is one of the three films that I consider the all time best and most beloved trilogy of gay-themed movies. </p>

 <p> Frank is a gay teen who runs away from his repressive parents in Luxembourg, in order to live his life in the hedonistic, drugs-and-sex fueled nightlife of 1984 Amsterdam. He finds work at the House of Boys, a notorious private gay show club/bordello run by the strict Madame, a drag queen. Frank immediately develops a crush on Jake, his roommate in the club's dorm, who makes it clear that he is straight and has a girlfriend. Of course, being in this line of work suggests Jake is open to other possibilities, and the boys eventually become very close ... too close, according to Madame, who feels it may be bad for business. But the real villain here turns out to be AIDS, then called "gay cancer" in the media, which eventually impacts heavily on their lives.A look at the movie poster or DVD cover, or even most of the trailer, could lead you to believe this is just another fluff film about go-go boys playing their customers and each other. It is much more than that, actually a well-crafted coming-of-age drama that is also a nostalgic look back at the attitudes and music of the eighties.Most of all, it is a riveting look back at the early days of the AIDS epidemic, with news clips and talk of the early misconceptions of the disease, and how it affected diverse groups of people. It is obviously sad, but realistic in its portrayal of what actually went on, something that we need never to forget. It also reinforces the concept of "family" as being something you are not necessarily born into, and how one should never let go of your dreams. The story is cohesive and well presented, technically excellent, with acting that is mostly very good. Overall, it rivals "Longtime Companion" and similar films built around the epidemic, although AIDS is not the main focus in this one.DVD release in the US is 5/27/12, from Breaking Glass Pictures, and also available for download or streaming on various services and on-demand systems. Not rated, but would be a solid R for language and sexual content. I give it a solid four stars out of five. </p>

 <p> On December 8th, 1 week following World AIDS Day, I watched an unexpected film titled 'House of Boys'. Expecting a cute sexy, even funny film, I was instead delivered an intense saga of life, and death from a film set in the mid 1980's in Amsterdam. It took me back 20 plus years, when as a nation in America, we watched people die of ignorance and an inability to beat the disease. Ironically, the film made me a bit angry. Angry that in 2012, we're still fighting AIDS, and worse, people are still becoming infected. I've never been to Amsterdam, and I hear it's still far more liberal than America, but even there, efforts are being made to change and control the acts of the people.Torch Song Trilogyis to the 70's what House of Boys is to the 80's. Both are set in nightlife venues catering to/for members of the gay community.  But House of Boys adds the dire consequence of a relatively unknown and deadly diseases in it's earliest days.  I was honestly shocked that the film was made around 2009.  Unlike others, this one is a real unexpected slap across the face.  Much of the films centers around our cast of young male dancers ("dancer for money" as Tina Turner said in her 1984 song 'Private Dancer').  While Tina is not on the soundtrack, many other great artists are featured in the film including Klaus Nomi, Roy Orbison, Marc Almond (The Very Best of Soft Cell) and Jimmy Somerville.  It's as easily a true story as any others, and all the characters / acting and directing are 4 & 5 stars.  You will get some cute and sexy fun, but watch for the curve balls throughout the film.Watch this film, if nothing else, for a grim reminder AIDS still kills, though maybe not as horrifically as it did more than 2 decades ago. </p>

 <p> I like the intention of this film, but it did not coalesce for me. The first act tries to be a sexy look at life in a strip club, with gay runaway falling for straight guy who is gay for pay. In Act 2 (as the film divides itself) we make a quick spiral downward to the AIDS crises. The writing and script lack a lot in this section of the movie, and I just think the two halves did not add up to an effective whole. </p>

 <p> Light hearted little film with stylized acting and stereotyped characters.  Much like an art film where the characters have been sketched in oil paint.  No deep hidden evil villains or sinister plots.  Everybody likes everybody which in itself is refreshing.  A few really sexy teaser dance routines in the cabaret style &#8211; after all 98% of the film takes place in the House of Boys brothel located in the red light district of Amsterdam.  Occurs during the early stages of the AIDS plague.  Might not be for everyone&#8217;s taste but I found it entertaining and well worth watching - sort of like a light not so serious sparkling wine.  Hopes this helps &#8211; Enjoy. </p>

 <p> Some viewers, unfortunately, will pass on this film as the cover of the DVD makes it appear to be a gay sexploitation waste of time. It is anything but that. Written and directed by Jean-Claude Schlim (with assistance from Christian Thiry and Robert David Graham) this is one of the finest films about the early days of the AIDS pandemic and long with `Longtime Companion' is probably one of the more important films for the public to understand the inception of the disease that still hovers darkly over the globe. The cast is rich in talent and the method of unfolding the story is superb.In opening credits we see an apparent carefree young lad running through sunlit cornfields - perhaps reference the path to Oz: where that goes is revealed at the end of the film. It is 1984 and a gay high school lad Frank (Layke Anderson) escapes his rigid parents by moving to Amsterdam where he lands a job as a bar boy in a gay dance club, the House of Boys run by a man referred to as Madame (Ugo Kier) who keeps everyone in tow as well as performing in drag on stage. Frank is assigned a room with a straight boy Jake (Benn Northover) who is the club's most popular dancer and who makes considerable money participating in passive physical gratification for the gentlemen who frequent the club. Jake has a girlfriend who sneaks in through the window of their room at night for trysts with Jake: Frank must then move in with transgender Angelo (Steven Webb) and raunchy mohawked dancer Herman (Oliver Hoare) for the night. Frank is talented and wants to leave his job at the bar where he assists the gentle lovely Emma (Eleanor David) and become a dancer. In the meantime Frank has fallen in love with the unattainable straight Jake but the two become close friends. Jake has been saving his money as a dancer and as an escort to run away with his girlfriend, but when his savings go missing he realizes his girlfriend has taken the money to abort Jake's baby. Jake is decimated by this but at the same time he leans on Frank for succor. The two boys realize their friendship has turned to being lovers. Jake introduces Frank to his way with clients and in the process falls through a glass tabletop sustaining cuts the require sutures. Frank takes Jake to the hospital where they encounter Dr. Marsh (Stephen Fry) who ultimately discovers that Jake has no T cells - and the mystery and cruel head of AIDS arises. Jake is fired form the club by Madame who fears for the reputation of this new plague and Frank and Jake move in together, compliments of Emma. From this point Jake has obvious Kaposi's sarcoma and the rest of the film is how Frank and the friends of the club are supportive. The unique aspect of the story is that it is the straight boy receiving passive sex from clients is the one who becomes infected. The beginning of the film is repeated with the full story at the end.This story could have easily been melodrama but the manner in which the story is handled and the fine acting on the part of the actors involved allows it to rise into the realm of very significant films. It copes with tragedy but it also emphasizes the honest meaning of love in all forms. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, April 12 </p>

 <p> For a decade, HIV was fodder for some amazing films, novels, non-fiction, theater... then, as the new treatments became more effective, avoidance became the name of the game.  Forget the opportunities to explore the human condition - beyond any disease or diagnosis.  Heck, forget safer sex and prevention.  Denial is powerful - and it can cost opportunities to better understand ourselves and communities.Obviously, I don't consider it an insult to refer to this as an AIDS film.  Like the best of that genre, HIV is a lens for viewing family, friendship, love, work, and even those who use us for personal and financial gain.  It builds from a solid script.  The acting is solid, never cloying, and consistent across the cast.  The director clearly has a point of view, and conveys it without resorting to cliche.As with life, this film has plenty of joy and humor.  It is not a downer, does not seek to lecture.  It effectively gives us a way to look at others and to examine our own feelings and life story.  This all sounds rather intellectual - I enjoyed the film at a far more basic level! </p>

 <p> I knew from the start of this movie it was going to catch my attention, and that it did, all the way to the end of the movie.  It just kept getting better.  It turned very serious when one of the main actors contacted AIDS around 1984, the movie had some VERY disturbing pictures of his illness until he died.  However, the movie was about boys basically running away from home because of being gay or abused, and crossing upon this Go-Go Boy dance club.where they were taken in and became best friends and we learn the politics of AIDS discrimination even in our own community.  I don't want to tell you much more because it's definitely a movie you should see. </p>

 <p> Unlike some other reviewers, I watch movies for the quality of the entertainment, not for the quality of the preaching. If I want to learn about AIDS, about the history or symptoms or progression or politics of the disease, I'll look it up&mdash;I won't watch a movie. I watch movies ONLY to be entertained, never to be educated.The big problem with this movie is that it's stupid, boring and totally, totally unbelievable. It starts out like a farce, with cartoon good kids and cartoon bullies and cartoon bad parents all interacting frenetically; and the thirtysomething high school kid pumping his thing behind his unlocked door right when Mom and Dad and Little Sis noisily come home&mdash;but does he hear them before they barge in and catch him full-handed? Of course not! Or even like a high school musical (the painfully contrived, amateur Fame-esque dance that bursts out of nowhere on the high school steps as the opening credits roll?) Or God only knows what&mdash;except that it turns into a maudlin, preachy, soapy tragedy long before the end.This is a TERRIBLE movie, in which Luxembourgers talk like Cockneys and the Dutch talk like Americans and everybody always looks like they just stepped out of the shower... and it's all just a crazy, mixed-up, phony mess that's as annoying as gnats swarming around your face. I hated it. </p>

 <p> I loved this movie for all that it is worth. But what I love most about this movie that one should get from it, is the essence of Love, Friendship, and the beauty that change can bring. Although change is scary in all of the character's lives, they are all still close and tightly-knit to the extent of a family. Watch this movie when you have the time and the heart and I promise you that this movie will change your life as it has changed mine. :) </p>

 <p> This coming-of-age story is set during the time when I was likewise coming out.  The tale is heartbreakingly accurate.  Every young person should see this film to be reminded of how horrible HIV-AIDS was before we had today's drugs, and to remind them that infection-prevention is way more important than the ephemeral pleasure of unprotected sex. </p>

 <p> I gave the movie five stars due to the fine acting and its courageous portrayal of how AIDS affected the gay population in 1984.  The title can be misleading as it sounds more like a comical farce.  Far from it.  The movie touches on the pain of being rejected by family due to sexual orientation.  The love that develops between Frank and Jake is heartwarming and the devotion shown by Frank during Jake's subsequent illness is inspirational.  No sugar-coating here. </p>

 <p> How can one write about something was once forgotten but now in all of its glory and horror is resurrected.  So much of this film mirrors actual life, love and death.  Suggest that you view this film with open concentration.  The lives in this film could have been any of thousands in Western Europe during the late 70s and early 80s, in part, I was one. Enough said.  This film will become a classic, just like "Boys in the Band." It is a snapshot of but a brief part of the struggle against HIV/AIDS.  NJMJr! </p>

 <p> Set in the heady days of the eighties, before the onset of AIDS, this is a tale about Frank (Layke Anderson) who runs away from home with two of his friends; they head off to Amsterdam where he is abandoned by them. He then stumbles on `The House of Boys', who are looking for dancers, so he applies. Madame gives him a job behind the bar instead as he has to work his way up and tells him he can room with top dancer Jake (Benn Northover). Benn has a girlfriend and is allegedly straight, but this does not  stop young Frank from falling for him.Jake also has a troubled past and we are allowed glimpses of that in flashback; he also does `private' work for his clients at the club. During one such session Jake collapses and has to be taken to hospital where it is discovered that he has a problem with his blood.This is a film about love; it uses the setting of this cabaret, backroom club as the vehicle. It also tries to chart the screaming lack of concern and research that happened in the early days of the AIDS virus. It is even referred to as `the gay cancer' by one doctor. Stephen Fry puts in an appearance as the caring doc too.This is not a sex fest although there is a smattering of bedroom and risqu&eacute; dance routines, but for any seasoned clubber there is nothing here to make you spill your cocktail. It is also nice to see that groin grabbing whilst dancing was not invented by the hippity hoppity brigade as there is plenty of that going on here. The music is quite authentic, with Soft Cell, Spandau Ballet and a few other tunes from the era.Most of the acting is creditable but some bit players that are more drama queen than award nomination material, which can be awkward at times. The lads are mostly sexy enough but some of the cabaret `turns' would not last 2 minutes in a modern club, you need more than make up to put on a good show dears, is all I am going to say.Still this tells of an important time in gay and world history through the microcosm of a few peoples experience with the disease and there are both good and bad times along the way. This is a two hour film and it kept me gripped throughout. Jean Claude Schlimm (`Shadow of The Vampire') has given us a touching, well made and very relevant story that should make you think and only the hardest heart would not be moved by this great piece of cinema. </p>
