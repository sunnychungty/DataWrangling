 <p> Big Ving Rhames fan always thought that Stacy Dash was a super fox appreciate Robert Townsend attempting to tell the story of such a fame and troubled sports figure. But the story moved slow didn't like how he filmed his fight scenes could have been more detailed overall a 3 star for not bad but good content. </p>

 <p> Not a first class fight film </p>

 <p> I had the chance to watch an advance screening of this film and am looking forward to owning the DVD to see it again. I was pleasantly surprised how great the acting was; Ving Rhames is terrific as Sonny L. Probably my favorite performance, though, was from Nicholas Turturro, who could give Joe Pesci a run for his money! At times, I had to remember that I wasn't watching a documentary (although I'm sure director Robert Townsend took a few liberties!)With the language and occasional violence, obviously this is a film for adults. Highly recommended! </p>

 <p> Ving Rhames is Sonny Liston in a fascinating story of one of the most hated boxers of all time. If you know little about Liston this film will fill in the blanks. </p>

 <p> I have noticed above on the spec's it says this movie has English Sub-titles, however when I was at Blockbuster as always I check to see if the DVD's are either closed captioned or sub-titled as both my kids are deaf, the DVD cover said nothing about either, so of course I put it back as I do any movie that has niether.So I am wondering if anybody out here that own's this movie can check for me if this things is truly subtitled and would like to thank whom ever in advance.  Thank You,  Fredrick </p>

 <p> I knew nothing about Sonny Liston before this film. All I ever knew was that I wanted Ali to win the fight between the two of them since I only developed an interest in the boxing world because of The Greatest. This film gave me an insite into this man's life and I was truly shocked by the things I learned. This is a film worth watching; albeit, I still wanted Ali to win his bout with Liston. Very good movie. </p>

 <p> Ving Rhames does a fantastic job of being Sonny Liston.  I've seen a few things about Sonny but this movie kinda gives you an inside view of the man and his frame of mind.  Good Job. </p>

 <p> I am surprised Townsend would make such a movie!  It was good, but not Sonny Liston as he really was.  I know it's difficult for Hollywood to make a realistic-type movie about celebrities, although they did an excellent job with Ray Charles.  Val Rhames was too old to play Liston, first off, especially in the 1950's and early 60's.  The people who really played a part in Liston's life wasn't there and they were inaccurate in many things.  I knew the &#34;real&#34; Sonny Liston, and although I like Rhames in many parts, I did not like him in this. </p>
