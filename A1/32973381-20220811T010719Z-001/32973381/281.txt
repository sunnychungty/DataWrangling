 <p> The stories are fairly decent and do surprisingly well in color...but...well...You just gotta see that red truck in"Approach With Care" Disc 3!It's the Sanford And Son" truck!I recognized those patches of primer on itlike stripes on a zebra.It must have been around before 1972 in props.well, everyone else has said it all already and...You Just gotta see that red truck!I just realized why this series works so wellin looking at "Nobody Loses All The Time" Disc 3;Richard Kimble isn't just a fugitive, he's a doctor.It's like he has this hidden power and he always uses itlike a super hero. He's like Superman disguisedas Clark Kent.Okey, no primer on the S&S; truck but...when, in this, it drives into that junk yard to escape the police,it gave me a false memory. </p>

 <p> I just bought season four volume one today and watched many of the episodes.  I am impressed about the picture quality, sound and of course the theme music (which was all there).  I also appreciate them putting, "Next, The Fugitive in Color," at the beginning of each episode.  Nice touch!  However, I did notice in certain episodes:  The Last Oasis, the jukebox music from the ice-cream shop was different from the original, Death is the Door Prize, inside the convention, the music was different, and the episode Second Sight, the music that was playing inside the bowling alley was jazz music.  Other than that, I can't complain too much.  All of the original theme music to the show is all there!  So, all in all, I am 95% happy with it. </p>

 <p> My copy of The Fugitive, season 4, volume 1 arrived this afternoon from Amazon. In an uncharacteristic stroke, I stopped what I was doing and actually sat down to watch a television program in the daytime...So long its been that I've waited to finally see these episodes on DVD. I dove right into the season kick-off, "The Last Oasis", a fairly good chase episode, with Mark Richman perfectly cast as a deputy sheriff on the US-Mexican border, who is "obsessed" with capturing Richard Kimble (Evidently, Barry Morse was unavailable that week).Keenly aware of the uproar over CBS/Paramount's meddling with the background music in previous releases, I was all too conscience of those ubiquitous melodies that we otherwise pay no attention. Right away, several passages sounded of that familiar synthesizing. The synthesized effect even carried over into the established Rugelo cues. Could the ENTIRE music score have been reorchestrated, new AND original? If so, the enhancing didn't stop there. The episode exudes a crispness that extends beyond the sharp, clear audio, and into the picture, where nary a speck is seen, the colors bold and bright, and the overall definition, while no Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea or Time Tunnel (These two Irwin Allen series have become industry benchmarks for standard DVD quality), is at least as good as any previous Fugitive release. On the outer case, there is a disclaimer stating that, "Some episodes may be edited from their original network versions", but at nearly 52 minutes running time, "The Last Oasis" couldn't have been one of them. Even the original ABC "IN COLOR" opening blurb, featuring the cartoon "running man", is left in. Outstanding!With "The Last Oasis" now a positive experience under my belt, I eagerly look forward to the next episode, and a personal favorite, "Death is the Door Prize". I know I won't be disappointed. </p>

 <p> The Fugitive is my all time favorite television drama series.  Possible the other two favorites are The Twilight Zone (the original hosted by Rod Serling) and MASH.  I know MASH is not a drama; but in it's later seasons it became a dramedy.Anyway, I am waiting for the final DVD set, The Fourth and Final Season, Volume Two comes out before I buy the whole shebang.  Hopefully it will come out in a nice box set.  Yipppeeeee!  Let's not wait for a long time between releases, okay? </p>

 <p> After three seasons in black-and-white, it's now time to watch Dr. Richard Kimble (David Janssen) run for his life in full living color, with the arrival of "THE FUGITIVE: THE FOURTH AND FINAL SEASON, VOLUME ONE", a 4-Disc DVD set released by CBS/Paramount on November 2, 2010.And while I think it's definitely true that the episodes in the fourth and final year of the series are generally not as high in quality (script-wise) when compared to the three previous black-and-white seasons, there are still several very good shows to be found in the last year of the series, including some worthy cat-and-mouse encounters between Kimble and the one-armed man (whom we see a lot more of during season four)."The Evil Men Do" is my favorite episode in this DVD collection, with guest star James Daly doing everything he can to help out Richard Kimble by attempting to kill Dr. Kimble's pursuer, Indiana Police Lieutenant Philip Gerard. Kimble must then decide what his priorities are: his own freedom or Gerard's life? Some tense moments are in order in Act IV.These 15 episodes appear to be complete and uncut (about 51 minutes per show), and the color video looks very sharp and clear. In some of the episodes, there is some dirt visible during the title sequences, which I've noticed is a common occurrence on a lot of DVDs.For some reason, the credit portions of some TV shows and movies on DVD haven't been cleaned up to remove all of the dirt and speckles. Such is the case with some of the title and credit segments in this "Fugitive" set.But I'd say that CBS/Paramount, overall, did a really nice job with these DVD transfers. The colors look very true and accurate, and the mono audio sounds nice and full and clean too.I was also pleased to see that the original "in color" bumpers and voice-overs that were shown at the beginning of each of the fourth-season episodes when they first aired in 1966 and 1967 are included on these DVDs. And for the most part, the original background music seems to be intact too, which is very good news indeed.====================BONUS MATERIAL:Unlike all of the earlier "Fugitive" DVD releases, this volume contains English subtitles and a bonus feature. The bonus item is a 10-minute featurette called "Composer Dominic Frontiere: Season Of Change", in which 78-year-old Frontiere is briefly interviewed about his career as a Hollywood music composer and his association with "Fugitive" icons Quinn Martin and Peter Rugolo.Quite a bit of Frontiere's music is sprinkled throughout many of these fourth-season "Fugitive" programs.Some interesting tidbits of information are revealed in this short extra. The final three minutes of the ten-minute bonus consist of scenes from the "Fugitive" episode "Second Sight", which features some of Dominic Frontiere's musical handiwork.The "Season Of Change" featurette is presented in anamorphic widescreen format (approximately 1.85:1).====================MISC. INFO:This 4-Disc set has single-sided DVDs, with either three or four episodes on each disc.The episodes are presented in Full Frame video (1.33:1); the audio is Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono (in English only); there are 7 chapter breaks per show; and the DVD menus are simple, static, quick, and silent (yay!).And there's one extra menu choice this time around, that being a "Set Up" option for selecting the English subtitles.The DVD packaging is identical to the first six releases of "The Fugitive", with all four discs fitting comfortably inside a space-saving standard-sized DVD keep case, with two swinging trays inside the case to hold the four DVDs (two per tray).This "swinging tray" design is nice, in that it allows easy reading of the episode information that is printed on the paper insert that shows through the transparent plastic panels on the left and right sides of the case.====================THE EPISODES:Disc 1:The Last OasisDeath Is The Door PrizeA Clean And Quiet TownSharp Edge Of ChivalryDisc 2:Ten Thousand Pieces Of SilverJoshua's KingdomSecond SightWine Is A TraitorDisc 3:Approach With CareNobody Loses All The TimeRight In The Middle Of The SeasonThe Devil's DisciplesDisc 4:The Blessings Of LibertyThe Evil Men DoRun The Man Down====================A FINAL COMMENT:Richard Kimble's run is almost complete -- 105 episodes on the DVD shelf, with just 15 to go. And these shows have all looked great on Digital Disc, with this first half of Season 4 being no exception.The fourth-year episodes themselves are a bit of a hit-and-miss proposition as far as the quality of the scripts is concerned, but anyone who has started collecting "The Fugitive" on DVD certainly won't want to stop now.David Von PeinNovember 2010 </p>

 <p> While I'll agree, that the balance of story and action come off as uneven in a few episodes, (the ratings were slipping at thetime, and the network felt that placing more emphasis on the action would help), I feel that it helps with the overall momentum towards ending the series.In the opening of just about every other episode in this volume, Kimble is literally on the run, and the Work-Hard-Play-Hard actor David Janssen REALLY looks the part of a haggard fugitive,having aged prematurely over the run of the show; I can honestly understand why he didn't wish to continue for another season!!Thankfully, the very few replacement music cues heard have been better blended into the audio mix, this time around. </p>

 <p> Great finally the final season  (or at least the first half of the season) of the great series and it even switches to color, which after three years of black and white episodes its kinda a nice change.Now I was too young to watch the series originally so if the music is changed I would never know it, but if it is I am sure the original audience will be upset. Lets hope this season is perfect but I don't hold my breath from the past volumes and reviews. David Janssen is the last of the great stars whose tv series is a wonderful experience to watch from  beginning to end. One of the few series that actually has a final episode, One of the highest rated episodes of a tv series.Thousands tuned in to See David finally catch the one armed man.A great series with a nice two part finale that settles the series wonderfully unlike most shows which just simply stop making new episodes without a ending episode.Definitely an oldie but a goodie.God bless you David Janssen. </p>

 <p> I have never seen the color series until now so I have nothing to compare it to but I have seen all of seasons 2 and 3.  As far as I can tell, no synthesizer or "Hayes" music was used.  If any changes were made to the music, then it may have been to the jukeboxes or radios playing in the background, in a particular scene.  And if this was the case, whoever was responsible for replacing music, probably used music that was available at the time that this series was originally filmed.  They also blended it so well with the original score that I took no notice that anything was different.This particular season used scores from artists that were not featured in the black and white seasons.  A very nicely done 10 minute short was included, interviewing the man who provided the bulk of the music for season 4.  I also noticed that some scenes in the color episodes borrowed cues from the original Outer Limits, just as some scenes from the black and white episodes borrowed cues from the original Twilight Zone.Closed captioning is different on this particular set.  If you wish to use the closed captioning feature, then it must be enabled on the DVD menu.  It does not use the built-in closed captioning on your television set.Overall, this set is worth having.  The same effort made to get the music right in season 4 volume 1 should have been put forth into seasons 2 and 3. </p>

 <p> I watched these episodes back in 1966 as a 14 year old eighth grade student with my Mom and loved the show. After watching 3 seasons now on DVD with B&W and wonderful scripts, I do feel the scripts in Season 4 are a step below. Also the color and the sets seem a bit less REAL than Seasons 1-3. Nothing can be perfect, but I am ecstatic to own Season 4. I love David Jannsen and Barry Morse.......could anyone have portrayed the characters better? I think not. </p>

 <p> I finished watching just a few days ago my copy of Season 4 volume 1 .... I can only state what the others have said about this set of DVDs .... I think that the video and sound are outstanding .... The series going color to me kind of takes away from it's nestalgia (kind of the same way it did to the Andy Griffith show), but hey thats just me .... Im glad that the music seems mostly intact and that the studio did right for it's fans of this series .... The package is done well with the synopsis of each episode on inner liner .... The DVDs are in a 4 disc tray in the middle so you can read each episode without removing a DVD to do so .... All in all this was worth the wait and the money spent to buy them .... Here's hoping that Volume 2 is the same quality and comes in timely manner .... Thanks CBS/Paramount for not letting us down .... I just saw on TVSHOWSONDVD.COM that the second part of season 4 will be released on 2/15/11 .... I just hope that like the first set of season 4 that most if not all of the music is intact ..... </p>

 <p> The series was great from start to finish; but its greatness did diminish a bit in the final season. The stories were not quite up to the standards of previous seasons. Also, the move to color was unfortunate. It's not that the color is a bad thing, per se; but, as someone noted, somehow when it went to color it seemed to be more obvious that everything was filmed in and around sunny LA, regardless of where Kimble was supposed to be. (For example, near the end of "The Blessings of Liberty", you get a glimpse of a boat in a harbor in the background. Prior to that, there was no indication Kimble was in an oceanside city. I'm not sure the boat and water would have been as noticeable in a B&W filming). I read somewhere there was consideration of a fifth season; I'm glad it was decided to wrap up this excellent series before then, when the shark certainly would have been closing in. </p>

 <p> I had just come home from my first year of college in May of 1990 and happened to catch the fourth episode of this season, 'The Sharp Edge of Chivalry," on A&E one afternoon and I was immediately hooked. I had never heard of the show before this, but I could not get it out of my mind. I loved it. I spent the rest of that Spring and Summer tuning in to A&E every afternoon to watch The Fugitive. I loved the character and the way David Janssen played him. By far it is my all-time favorite program and it was the Fourth Season episodes that were my starting point. Throughout that summer I began taping every episode I could. When I went back to school in August, the one thing that made it hard for me to go was leaving my daily dose of The Fugitive as I did not have cable at school. This show has never left my thoughts entirely. It will always have a special place with me, and maybe this Fourth Season above all because that is how The Fugitive came into my life. I like Route 66 as well, but The Fugitive will always be #1 with me. </p>

David Janssen does a fantastic job as a doctor on the run from the law, falsely convicted for the murder of his wife; reprieved by fate when a train wreck freed him.... to run before the relentless pursuit of the police lieutenant obsessed with his capture...."

 <p> On February 15th, we will finally have the remaining episodes of season 4, which includes the two part climax, "The Judgement"! I hope all of these episodes are released exactly as shown in their original broadcast, especially the two part finale! Some fans have said that some of the music score was still being re-recorded on a few of the previous releases, but I didn't notice at all, so I'm assuming it must have been very minimal. I especially hope that Paramount leaves "The Judgement" completely intact because I have seen these episodes more times than any of the others and I would notice any changes immediately. Please, Paramount, release these episodes in their original form! </p>

 <p> The seventh release (Autumn 1966) of The Fugitive suffers from the diminished production values of Adrian Samish.The show comes off as a short shrifted version of the then new series 'The Invaders,' another Samish production.Anyone familiar with the earlier 'Outer Limits' will recognise Dominic Frontiere's theme music from thatseries first season (1963) in every episode of 'Fugitive' vol. 7. It's entirely embarresing and a completerip off. I give this vol. 7 two stars at best.Keith Owen </p>

 <p> CBS appears to have made a real effort to get the music right this time.As usual, the video is excellent.  Colors are realistic without being oversaturated.Have the episodes been remastered from the original negatives?  I just don't know.  The picture is sharp, but not as sensationally sharp as Season One.  This is not attributable to color versus black & white, since other color shows of the same era have been remastered to spectacular sharpness, e.g., THE TIME TUNNEL.  I'd give S4V1 a rating of 9.8 out of 10 for sharpness.I have not heard one single note of the dreaded Heyes replacement music.  That doesn't mean that there aren't any replaced cues, just that CBS has done a much better job of blending the replacements.I'm suspicious that some of the cues that I heard were indeed replacements, but they were so well blended that they could easily have been mistaken for original cues.  I won't know for sure until I can compare side-by-side with original broadcast recordings.  And anyway, most of the replaced cues are incidental music -- radios, jukeboxes, and background music in bars & restaurants.One oddity is a line of replaced dialogue in THE SHARP EDGE OF CHIVALRY.  At time index 37:59, Kimble hears a voice coming from the other side of a closed door -- a policeman's voice saying, "IT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK LIKE HE GOT AWAY."But in the original episode, the voice is that of Lieutenant Gerard, asking, "THERE'S NO OTHER WAY OUT?", followed by Richard Anderson's character replying, "NO."Will CBS please tell us WHY it was necessary to alter this one bit of dialogue?CBS heard fan complaints of no subtitles on previous volumes, and has included English subtitles for the hearing impaired on these dvds.Even though previous volumes included Closed Captioning for the hearing impaired, the captions could only be displayed on American tv sets with so-called "Line-21 closed-captioning decoders" (required by law in the USA since 1993, for the hearing-impaired).This is of no help to Fugitive fans in the UK or other countries whose television sets do not usually include American closed-captioning decoders.  With the captions now formatted as standard dvd subtitles, they are accessible to everyone.There is a short featurette on disc 4 about composer Dominic Frontiere and the use of his music in Season 4.  The featurette is a welcome addition to this volume and represents the first extra of any kind on any of THE FUGITIVE volumes.  I suspect that CBS commissioned it in response to fan complaints regarding the absence of extras on previous volumes.In some of my reviews of previous volumes, I have raked CBS over the coals for their shoddy work.  But fair is fair, and I'm just as quick to praise CBS when they get things right.  CBS has done a first-rate job with this dvd release.I'm concerned that CBS will give us a shoddy S4V2, repeating their pattern of releasing a good volume followed by a shoddy volume (S2V2 & S3V2).  I hope CBS won't let the goodwill of S4V1 lull them into thinking that they can now cut corners on S4V2 to save a buck.CBS can do good work when they focus on doing a QUALITY job instead of trying to get these volumes out the door quickly.CBS, will you PLEASE go back and remaster Season 3 from the original negatives and fix the music in Seasons 2 and 3?  Pretty please? </p>

 <p> The first half of the last season is now out; the series was now in color.  The remastered episodes look rich and vibrant.By now guest stars were making repeat appearances in other roles, such as Lois Nettleton in "Death Is The Door Prize".  Kimble's escapes were beginning to strain credulity; in "Second Sight", for example, he is temporarily blind and behind bars, but still manages to eventually get away. Surely no series in television history portrayed law enforcement officials as more incompetent.Kimble runs into the one-armed man, Fred Johnson, again in "A Clean And Quiet Town", but gets in trouble himself.  He escapes this time with the help of the mob!  Johnson gets away, too.  Thanks but no thanks!  That episode strains credulity almost to the breaking point, but, like the others, was never less than compelling.Good dramatic TV series ended at the right time, and "The Fugitive" was no exception.  Despite the continued quality of each episode, certain plot devices, like Kimble's assistance to various young women with problems, along with the far-fetched concluding escapes, begin to get stale.  But he's closing in on the real killer!  It won't be long now! </p>

 <p> The fourth and final season has finally arrived and as I gaze upon the reviews, I see not one single crybaby whiner babbling about the music, so it's all good, I'm waiting for my copy to arrive in the mail and I'll be all set. This season has alot of great episodes in it, probably some of the best of the whole series.....ENJOY, I know I will. </p>
