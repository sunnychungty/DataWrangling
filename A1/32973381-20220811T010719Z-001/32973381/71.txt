<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> PRACTICAL KEYBOARD </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Very effective keyboard for lowvision users. The color and big letters size are big help. Service was excellent, fast and well packaging item. Thanks. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> This keyboard is great for those of us who are reticent to use our reading glasses.  Bright as can be.  Only suggestion is that &#34;they&#34; include descriptions of every key's functionality in the instructions, as there are some missing.  Good news:  I called the manufacturer and a very pleasant customer service agent looked up the keys and told me what they &#34;do&#34; (she didn't know either!).I would recommend this for the function it was designed for. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Easy to see. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> My friends and I are computer gamers, so we know crappy keyboards.  I bought this as a gag gift for my friend and can't wait to see his expression.Now in terms of QUALITY.  This keyboard feels like it could break if you type at about 70 WPM or more.  You know those toy pianos you buy for kids?  Well those have more durability than this.The drivers did install without any problems.  Just plug it in and give it a few minutes to do its thing.So who is this product good for?People who have a hard time seeing and type VERY slow, or someone who just wants to buy it for giggles. </p>

 <p> The keyboard is light and feels cheaply made.  The letters are as advertised - easy to read especially in low light.  This is the reason why I bought the thing.  You really have to press the L key hard to make it respond.  You get what you pay for. </p>

 <p> The keyboard showed up today and when I pluged it in there was  nothing for me to do but use it, I like that no disk to install or configure. The board is different thatn the last one so it will take some time getting used to it but so far so good! </p>

 <p> Great keyboard for the elderly or for people with bad eyesight. </p>

 <p> This is an excellent keyboard for seniors and children. people who want to be able to see what the keys are will be very pleased. only complaint is that some of the additional function keys such as page up and page down or page break and stuff like that uses 2 letter abbreviations. works great and is durable. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I purchased this for someone who is visually impared (essentially legally blind) and the difference it made for their computer use was significant. Very easy to read labeling coupled with a sturdy construction makes this a top notch keyboard. The keys feel weighty, the board itself isn't at all flimsy, and the labels themselves aren't cheap stickers but well applied and look like they'll hold up to years of use. </p>

<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Very badly made </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I had high hopes for this keyboard, and the look of it when I opened the box only raised them further, since the keytop lettering is extremely nice. But it's way too poorly made. Some keys stick, others don't respond, the whole thing clatters in normal use (maybe to remind you how cheap it was), and the hard plastic wrist rest is pointless unless you also have hard plastic wrists -- and it's integrated with the keyboard, so you can't remove it to make room for a better one.Unlike many of the positive commenters here I actually DO touch-type, and that probably means I'm not the target audience for this device -- which appears to be crotchety old grandpas still using one-finger hunt-and-peck. (And if you're wondering why a touch-typist would want a large-type keyboard, you probably aren't aware of how often a programmer uses the the non-alphabetic.) Bottom line: Nobody should have to use a keyboard where you suddenly find yourself inadvertently typing in CAPS because you didn't hit the Shift key just so, or worse yet, unintentionally selecting a big block of material because the Shift key stuck and you hit an arrow key for a legitimate reason.One star is generous. It's trash. It's also just barely too cheap to justify the hassle and cost of return shipping. And yknow, recently I see lots of items like that for sale online -- vendors must realize they'd be swamped with returns if the items cost a bit more, so they price junky stuff just low enough to sucker you in and make you not bother demanding a refund. That way the extra volume puts them ahead regardless. Beware. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I enjoy this keyboard. An excellent replacement for the traditional black keys with small white letters. On the plus side, I often work or internet surf at night and do not need to turn on a lamp to see the keys. The ambiant light from the monitor is enough to see the keys therefore what I am viewing on my monitor is not diminished by the light of a lamp. For the price I highly recomend this product. For the price it is a great buy. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> PERFECT large print keyboard! </p>

 <p> If you have a vision disability and want a keyboard with large, easy to read print, this is an excellent choice. The keys are normal size so you can touch type. The print is matt, so there is no glare. The keyboard has a good &#8216;feel,&#8217; much better than you might expect for a board that costs less than $20. And as a free bonus you get a row of hot keys which, with Windows XP will launch your browser and email programs and control multi media. I'm ordering a second one because a large print board this good is hard to find! </p>

 <p> Sometimes you get what you paid for sometimes you don't.  Compared to the &#34;keys u see&#34; keyboard I tried, this one is head and shoulders better.  Quality is really good and THE KEYS DON'T STICK OR NOT WORK on some applications like the other brand did..I RECOMMEND THIS AS A GREAT VALUE FOR THE PRICE! </p>

 <p> I don't like all the small boards which seem to be all one finds at the discount store these days.  It looks funky, but that's a plus to me, too.  Someday I'll even set up the shortcut keys above the function keys. </p>

 <p> Pretty much a basic keyboard with large, easy to see key characters and basic hotkeys. This one is yellow colored which I like for the contrast. hookup was easy with the adapter supplied from my old board or it can be plugged into USB port directly. For the price, even if the lettering wears off after a year's worth of use, it's not that expensive to replace. My "hunt & peck" typing method seems to work well with the key set up and key pressure. After several days of use, I haven't had a problem with it yet. Recommend it for those who need a large print basic keyboard.A side note that this item, was purchased through Amazon using Super Saving shipping. Keyboard was delivered in 3 days! </p>

 <p> Great product! Bought this for my Mom who is in her 80's. I was a little worried after reading some reviews. I waited a good bit of time before posting this review to make sure the keyboard was working well.  Item works exactly as described. I would definitely buy this item again. </p>
