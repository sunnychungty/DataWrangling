 <p> This item works as described and yes, works great with Windows 7. The device is almost completely plug n' play. I use this with my netbook in the anatomy lab at the college I work at when tutoring students with histology (I transferred the installation drivers from the CD-ROM enclosed to a flash drive and it worked great!). The resolution isn't as sharp as say a microscope camera system with an adapter ranging $300-$500, but does the job with superb results. Give it about 10 minutes to warm up and the refresh gets better. It does appear to use a CCD chip, and from my astronomy days, I remember these requiring an optimal temperature range to get to working at peak. This is normal, and hey, Celestron also makes telescopes. Might want to use with PhotoShop or GIMP to enhance contrast on some images. Matches images similar to those taken in textbooks! I love this thing! Great for the field if using a netbook or laptop. </p>

 <p> I use this with a OMAX 40-2000 stereo microscope. Camera goes in one eyepiece and view through other to center. I saw some comments about update speed...no problem at all with my Win 7 machine. Software needed latest version to work with 64 bit version but got it from Celestron. I can take videos or stills. Grain was not an issue...I chose the setting to double the pixel count...no issues.  Color is very good and resolution is outstanding with no stair stepping issues. Yes...the FOV is  smaller than with normal eyepiece...about same as a 15mm eyepiece in magnification with tighter FOV due to the small chip. To get more you would need a much larger chip (very expensive). I found a terrific way to get around this....download a free program called AUTOSTITCH.  It is a program that allows you to put together large mosaics without any worry about alignment, shooting order...just move the specimen around and continue to shoot lots of individual frames. Now select them all in AUTOSTITCH and the program will automatically place them in the right location, blend and even smooth out gradients.  I just did one that needed 40 frames to cover the whole specimen...and it was unbelievable. Final tweaking of color, sharpness, curves can be done in any photo paint program although I use Photo Shop. The only negative issue is that with the included software when you hit the shutter button it takes a couple of seconds before it takes the image...but not a big issue for me.After spending a lot of time with this camera I decided to update my review...gave it another star...it is that good. I sent some of the photos I did with it to Celestron. They were impressed and are going to use my photos in advertising!  You can't go wrong with this camera. </p>

 <p> For the past week, I have used this Celestron unit with my Carl Zeiss Laboval binocular microscope. Initially, I was impressed by the solid build--the housing, adaptor and set screws are well-made. The collector window also has an anti-glare coating; I was honestly expecting less for $35. I use this to photograph crystalline inclusions within gemstones, and once I developed a technique, the results have been superb. The unit's strong points are color sensitivity and clarity. If the unit has one weakness, it would be the lack of adjustable contrast--bright details against darkfield illumination easily get blown out. The solution here is careful adjustment of the lighting, and having precise condenser and diaphragm controls makes good results much easier to achieve. One other problem, which will be minor for most users, is the sensor picks up some IR fluorescence common to ruby, amethyst, and a few other dark stones.As others have noted, the software doesn't display full resolution images while in use, but if you have a good technique it's not much of a problem. Since the focal plane for my objects is not perpendicular to the lens axis, I must take multiple shots to capture all the detail. This is done by first setting the focus at one end of the image's focal depth, then taking successive shots while incrementally adjusting the focus. I then take the group of pictures into Photoshop, where I combine them into one sharp image. You can see examples of my technique in customer images. </p>

 <p> The value of this camera for the money is pretty good considering how cheap it is, but the problem is that while you are staring at the screen, you're getting a low-resolution image.  When you click the button, suddenly you get to see the full picture well.  This severely limits the utility of the device.  If you have a trinocular microscope, then you can look at the scene, and just click when you see something good.  But if you are using the screen alone, the video isn't great. </p>

 <p> I tried several of the USB camera digital microscopes to learn that there is absolutely no use in &#34;digital magnification&#34;.  Basically, you get a fixed pixel density that looks good on a computer screen until you start to zoom in....then the pixels just start to spread out.This little gem works very differently and works well.  Basically, you must use it too enhance your microscope.  We found a metal microscope with glass optics at a garage sale but there was no eyepiece....you put the camera in the eyepiece.The camera is about 15x which is a great pixel density for your eyes and screen.  Then, it allows the microscope optics to do the rest of the magnification...therefore, optical zoom.Our microscope gives an excellent image at 1200x!  Cells, bacteria, amoeba's, etc REAL SCIENCE for under $50! Add this to a &#34;decent&#34; glass lens microscope under $100 and you can share images on a computer, take photos and videos, awesome!it is nice after all the searching to find something that actually works! </p>

 <p> This works fine with the microscope and usues usb to connect to a computer.  The only drawback is it is only 2mp.  I would like to see more megapixels but believe it or not 2 mp is sufficient for the work I do.  It is so nice to take an image of my slide and be able to email it to an expert to get his opinions as I use it for parasite identification in my tortoises. </p>

 <p> Let me start by saying that I am not a professional microbioligist. I just wanted to get a nice basic microscope to satisfy a long time interest into our unseen world. The idea of an imager to enable more comfortble viewing via my laptop struck my fancy. The cost did not. Then I came across this item on Amazon. At one-fifth the cost of most other digital imagers out there I decided to give it a try. Frankly I didn't expect the imaging quality to compare very favorably with through the eypiece viewing. To my surprise and delight - it did! The installation was a breeze and the software loaded without fuss on windows 7. The ability to archive and email the images comes in as an added bonus. Couldn't be more pleased, and I feel confident that I made the best and most economical choice for my needs. PS, I am using it with my Celestron 500x microscope. From the other reviews I've read here, it should perform comparably with similar equipment. Highly recommended. </p>

 <p> If you're getting into video microscopy this is a good imager. It only works with a microscope, it's not a webcam like those other usb cameras. So don't buy it for that. The software is basic but it works fine for me on winxp sp3. Also Celestron has been around forever so I wouldn't be afraid of some fly by night company. Enjoy it to explore the ordinary things around the house. My kids 22 and 23 like it too. </p>

 <p> I'm sure on a different microscope this would be even better.  The camera itself is to small for my ocular opening, and the adjustment ring is too big.  BUT I can still get a great photomicrograph - either still or video - so it is a good product, and well worth the price. </p>

 <p> This is a great product, good quality at a nice cost/benefit rate, it does what it s supposed to do! Easy to install and operate software, at least it worked well whith my Windows 7 OS. I use it with a trinocular Labomed LX400 microscope and I've taken very nice pictures of blood smears and others human samples... Video is good enough, but could have been sharper, but it acomplish the task... for a 2MP resolution cam what else can you ask!I mean, for my purposes it's fine! </p>

 <p> I was quite surprised to discover the fine quality of such a relatively inexpensive devise. I was a professional Microbiologist prior to studying Medicine and still have three microscopes, including an ancient Swift International as well as a 50 year old Nikon with a rather ancient lighting system. Worked just great with these on all four opticals, including oil immersion. Very easy to install and to use on Windows 7 OS, including snapshot and video plus album, etc. Plenty of easy-to-use features. I have a more up-to-date scope but that is kept at my clinic so I haven't had a chance to experiment with that one but I figure it will be even better. I also have a Canon Imagezoom software but I have not used it with this devise yet. That might be interesting. Not disappointing! I definitely recommend this to both amateur and professional. </p>

 <p> I purchased this imager primarily for use with my AmScope microscope but also had hopes it might work with my telescopes as well.Still images of fixed slides were as hoped for with this microscope; about the same quality as actually viewed.  Still images of moving protists were a challenge -- three hands would have been useful to keep the organism in the field of view, in focus, and take the snapshot.  Videos worked well at lower resolution but showed some distortion at higher resolutions due to movement of the organism during the greater time needed to capture the frames.  I use the freeware applications infraView and AVI2BMP to extract individual frames from the video files.I haven't had an opportunity to use the imager for astrophotography due to travel and cloudy skies, so this afternoon I ran a test with my Orion 80x400 mm refractor pointed at a distant building using the freeware SharpCap.  The imager worked well, although the focus tube had to be extended to near maximum length.  A crude guesstimate of the magnification is about 50x with 400 mm focal length, and a field of view of about 10 feet at 100 yards.  I expect this imager to work well with brighter objects such as the moon and planets, but it does not have the versatility for deep sky imaging. </p>

 <p> As a hobbyist, I am impressed.  I bought a compound binocular microscope for my grandchildren.  I was anticipating the angst and noise created for the children waiting their turn at the microscope, so I added this to the list.The software was easily installed, intuitive in its use, and great company support.  The installation disk was cracked (although it seemed to install OK) so I sent an email to the company requesting a new one.  It's on the way.  The pairing of the camera to the microscope could not have been easier.The grandchildren love taking pictures of the things they are seeing.  The display on the computer is excellent.  This product exceeded my every expectation. </p>

 <p> This is a fairly low-resolution camera, so I couldn't say &#34;I love it&#34;, but I also couldn't afford the camera I'd really love.This one is super-simple, easy to set up, and does exactly what it says it will do.Despite one reviewer's comments, with just a tiny bit of effort, it CAN be made parfocal with your other eyepiece.  It just takes a spacer or some tape to do that.I would recommend this to others.LS </p>

 <p> I have an American Optical Model Sixty microscope- a classic student scope- that I use in my amateur naturalist studies, looking at insect parts, fungal spores, and so forth. I wanted a simple, cheap, way of capturing images from it, and the Celestron 44421 proved just the ticket, especially as I bought a used one in excellent condition for $24. I slipped the camera into the scope, plugged the USB connector into my Mac, and I was capturing images.Now there are some drawbacks to this camera; the first is that images are only 2MB in size. That's pretty small these days (although the first Nikon pro digital SLR was only 1.4MB.) The other, for Mac users, is that the supplied software doesn't support OSX- you'll need to use Photo Booth or some other commercial software. I was hoping Image Capture might work, but I haven't found a TWAIN compliant driver for this camera, and  Celestron doesn't supply one.But for the young scientist or the amateur on a budget, this is an excellent buy. It's whetted my appetite for higher resolution, depth of field, and contrast, and I'm already thinking about a better microscope and adapters for my M34 cameras. </p>

 <p> It works  tho the software that comes with it does not work correctly with Win 7.  I had to set the burst feature to 1 shot and use that to take pictures.  (I found that the free VLC software will also work with this gadget.)  Picture quality is lacking due to too few pixels. </p>

 <p> I am glad that so many people are having great results with this imager, I am not! I believe the biggest issue is the software. After plugging into my computer and opening the software I get a thumbnail of what is on my slide. To try and get a clear focus is next to impossible. I have a little handheld Celestron that gives me a much better image. I am now looking at an adapter that I can use one of my digital cameras on the microscope instead of this imager.I would not recommend this product. </p>

I did lots of research before buying the microscope for our homeschool and this imager just seemed the most natural add-on.

 <p> When I first ordered this imager, I wasn't holding out too much hope of being blown away with the image quality. After all, a high end version of a device like this can sell for a heck of a lot more than $50.00!  I mean seriously...  What kind of quality could I expect out of a version that sells for under fifty?  How about nearly as good?  I'm totally serious!  This thing is GREAT!  I recently purchased and returned several USB equipped digital microscopes looking for one that could not only give me impressive results through the eye piece, but also high quality SHARP images on my computer that I could then save, archive and share.  Unfortunately, all of the models I purchased prior to my last had at least one fundamental FLAW in the design that made it a poor choice for what I was looking for.As I was boxing up the 5th digital microscope product for return and refund to Amazon.com, I decided that I would just focus on a quality microscope first and worry about the computer side of things later. After spending a few hour reading up on the latest brands and models of quality scopes, I purchased theCelestron 44104 500x Power Advanced Biological Microscopefrom Amazon.  Folks, this is a GREAT scope for the money and I highly recommend it if you are looking for something solid with excellent optics without spending a fortune!  You can read my review of this great product in my reviews section. After using the scope for a few sessions and being thoroughly satisfied, I found myself still longing for that computer interface option.  I then searched the web for a stand alone USB microscope camera and was pleased to see that there were such things on the market!  My first search brought up a link to this product here on Amazon.com.  The fact that it was made by Celestron was a good omen and I figured that it should mate to my scope without too much trouble.  (Turned out to be totally true!)As I said earlier in my review, I was a bit skeptical on the quality based on the price and some of the low review scores this thing had received.  But, since low reviews on a product often say more about the reviewer's skills to read and follow instructions than they do about the product's quality, I went ahead and ordered myself one. After waiting for what seemed like an eternity *, the device arrived today and within 5 minutes I had the imager installed in the adapter ring and sitting on top of my 44104 in place of the eyepiece.I am using a Macintosh computer and as usual the Mac support from Celestron was practically nonexistent. This didn't bother me though because I already owned a copy of what many consider to be the best webcam software available on ANY computer platform.  I am of course referring to the award winning "EVOcam" webcam application from EVOlogical.  I plugged in the USB cable from the imager, fired up EVOcam and held my breath! My heart was racing as I pulled into focus my first slide.In a word... WOW!!  Not only did the image look EXACTLY like it did to my eye with the conventional optics, the imager was reproducing every byte of sharpness and brilliant color contained in the specimen under the objective lens!  I really don't think you could ask for any more from an imager than this!  With my 44104 now paired up with a great piece of webcam software like EVOcam, the sky's the limit in what I can do with this rig!  How about time-lapse movies of a bacterial culture growing?  The feeding habits of an Ameba of Hydra as it goes about its day?  I kind of feel sorry for the PC folks out there that don't have a program like EVOcam to use with their scope and this imager!So there ya go... Buy yourself a quality microscope first and then pick up this imager second for the ultimate digital microscope setup!  As for the 1-Star reviewer's opinions here on this product page?  I'll go with "UTTERLY CLUELESS" on a good day and down right idiotic on a bad one.  I don't know if the scope they were trying to use this thing with was total garbage, or they simply don't know how to read an owners manual!  Either way, their low review scores say more about their own reading and comprehension skills than anything related to this product.* My only gripe is with the retailer who sold me the product. (Adorama Camera) It took WAY TOO LONG to get here!  Come on people!  10 days?  That is ridiculous!  If you have a choice in which retailer to purchase this from on Amazon, CHOOSE SOMEONE BESIDES THEM!  Unless you don't mind waiting 10 days for your imager to arrive in your mailbox.  ;o) </p>

 <p> I'll admit, I had fairly low expectations when I saw the price on this imager. I've been watching imagers for 10 years and the price was always so high that I didn't buy. I am absolutely amazed at the images I've gotten out of the thing.My microscope is a 1982 SRC Research childrens microscope, very low end. It has 100, 300, and 600X.I tried this on Windows 7. Install went smoothly.I tried the software that came with the imager, and it wasn't terrible. Not exactly feature rich either.Pros:Image is fairly clearColour is goodImage resolution is very nice with the 2MP resolution.Simple installation, will adapt to microscopes and likely telescopes as well since many use the same eyepieces.Cons:Have to remove view lens from microscope. My old scope this is easy, but my nephews that I got at Toys R' Us was glued in and when I broke the glue I had to clean the lens tube of glue bits.Camera refresh speed is a bit slow, but not terrible. The only time I notice it is when I'm quickly moving a slide around searching for something.At first I forgot to remove the lens from my microscope, and everything was black and grainy except a tiny image the size of a quarter. Once removed everything worked great. A few of the lower reviews mentioned my above issue, so I believe they forgot to read the instructions like I did.An example image from this can be found on my flickr page:[...]Note: I'm using a very old microscope and I'm still learning to focus with a camera. </p>

 <p> I purchased this camera at a convention.  I have the Amscope  40x - 2000x tri ocular dark microscope I purchased on Amazon..  As other reviewer stated, I wasted two days trying to get my win 7 computer to &#34;see&#34; the camera.  Got the same error about not being hooked up to the computer or being used by another device.  Like the other reviewer, I too loaded the s/w, deleted it, reloaded it, rebooted my PC, etc.  I was getting really mad.  I finally got it to work, but it's horrible!  The s/w says it's win 7 compatible, but you have to run it in xp sp 3 to make it appear on screen.  Then, I can only get an image when I use the lowest pwr on the scope.  Anything higher and the picture is too large to fit on the screen.  My microscope even has a device specifically on the tri ocular lens which can be rotated up or down to get the image in focus. The camera still doesn't focus.  I've even hand held the camera higher and lower to the eye lens to try to get it focused and it still doesn't work.  The image is great in the microscope eye pieces, but the camera is worthless.Also, the software loads the drivers in windows as the camera is a video device only.  I tried everything I could think of to make my PC &#34;see&#34; the camera and not a Video device, but windows just kept telling me it already had the best drivers.  So, because it does that, the s/w locks out any options to change the camera settings, so you can't even try to adjust the pics that way.  I also get the black screen on my computer when trying to increase the magnification.  I spent a lot more money on this because I bought it at at the event.  They made it look so great and wonderful.  To me, when a product says it is compatible in win 7, that means it should RUN in the win 7 format and not have to be dummied down to make it work.  I did contact the company and told them all the things I tried to get it to work.  They did respond, but it was a joke.  They referred me to the s/w download I already had, and even told me it sounded like I've already tried what they were suggesting to me to try.  What the heck kind of help is that?  Telling me to try something they already knew I tried and didn't work.  It didn't make any sense.The comment about the help key is correct too.  When you go to help key, you get this slow scrolling msg about the dumb manufacturer.  NOTHING about really getting help.  Now I'm looking at having to purchase another camera that will work w/my new scope.  I'm in vet tech school and need this for microbiology.  My advice, save your money.  It's not worth it because it doesn't work. </p>

 <p> Save your money.  Won't work with win 7 and pictures and software are minimal, & too basic to be useful </p>

 <p> This is really a neat device to attach to your computer to view things on a microscope. The device is easy to use.. plug and play. </p>

 <p> I love this thing, it is awesome. I can not use the software that came with because my software for my webcam is using the camera and I can not figure out how to make the webcam software not use it but the webcam software is really good so I don't mind. I am sure there is a way but it doesn't matter since I did get it working. I have read other complaints with the software but there is a way to use the camera without it. This thing takes awesome photos and has great resolution, I am very happy with the product and the price. No where is it specified what the magnification of this camera is but I would guess its about 40X since it is much better than my 20X eyepiece, about twice the magnification maybe a little less. </p>

 <p> Compared to other cameras for microscopes this is a sale... resolution is poor but it gets the job done. You can measure using the software that comes with the camera </p>
