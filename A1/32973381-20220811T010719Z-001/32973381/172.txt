 <p> The spectacular scenery and fascinating wildlife of Alaska are seen at their most intriguing in this film, which was nominated for a Best Documentary Academy Award. The history of the land from the height of the last great ice age 18,000 years ago is also explained, showing in some well made graphics how man and beast were able to cross into Alaska on the Bering Strait from Asia.  With marvelous aerial photography, as well as some underneath a stampeding caribou herd, and underwater for the hatching of the salmon and swimming seals. Other animals seen hunting and at play are the brown, black and polar bear, bison, musk ox, eagle and red fox. Beavers building their homes, whales in unison making bubble circles to catch herring, sea lions, and their predators, the Inupiat (Eskimo), who survive their year around existence in the harsh environment eating seal and whale meat.It follows this great "land of extremes" from spring to spring, a land that took the lives of hundreds of men seeking wealth during the gold rush, as well as their pack horses, shown here in some historic still photographs.Directed by George Casey, and written by Mose Richards with clarity as well as an almost poetic grace, it is narrated by Charlton Heston, who is gifted with a voice that is always a pleasure to listen to.Educational as well as glorious to look at, this is an excellent documentary on America's  least explored state.Total running time is 40 minutes. </p>

 <p> This is not a high-definition DVD (as already noted by another reviewer, the picture quality is the same as that of a regular DVD). That's a pity because the photography is great. While watching this disc I thought "wow, this DVD would be great if it really were in high-definition". Darn! </p>

 <p> This fine IMAX production really captures the spirit of the Alaska region, though focusing upon the animals and geological features, not the people. Not that people are not interesting (I would not mind seeing a documentary on innupiat), but it is not every day I see a polar bear for instance, so give me a break.I have seen dumb IMAX movies before. This is not one of those duds. This is the best IMAX production I have ever seen bar none. There was one other IMAX movie about Alaskan explorers, or mountain climbers, something along those lines. It stunk. I don't even remember the title. I had paid the price of two tickets to see it. That was the last IMAX movie I ever paid to watch in the cinema.The problem with cinema is they want to charge $5, $10, then hit you hard for snacks and drinks of lousy quality. Fine. Then the movie better be awesome. Yet ninety-five percent of movies stink. So I never go to the cinema, and hardly anyone I know ever goes to the cinema. If you are a cinema owner, this is why you are looking at bankruptcy down the road.In a sea of dumb documentaries, this shines like a lighthouse, showing the way for all those wannabe producers struggling to navigate through the waters of film-making. Very hard-to-get footage. I am not sure how the camera crew got so near to wild predators like wolves and bears. You tell me. </p>

 <p> Tis is a short blu-ray movie that is somewhat interesting. Not much for the amount that blu-rays cost, however. </p>

 <p> Sometimes the impresive achievements of the Imax and dvd technologies exceed the quality of the content of a certain documentary. This is not the case. If any, this video keeps us longing for more, much more. Since the  beginning of this highly entertaining video we feel commited to watch one  of the untamed scenaries of our world. Virgin Landscapes (rivers and  mountains that are yet to be named), wild and funny animals (such as the  black bear taking a bath, the humpback whales bubblenetting, the wild polar  bear cubs and the stubborn salmon) and an extreme weather that changes the  sorrounding scenary on a daily basis are described and tought with either  the lightness of humour, or the concern of a nature fan. If you like to  watch beautiful images over and over, buy this dvd. </p>

 <p> If you're interested in bears then you might enjoy this.  As for me, I was hoping to see more of Anchorage & the Northern areas, and just more of the land in general.  But this movie is 40 minutes of bears, whales, and sea lions playing to a Charleton Heston narrative.  I liked the short clips about the Inupiat and the gold rush but other than that I just felt jipped, honestly I'd expect more from a documentary about such a great place as Alaska. </p>

 <p> I really enjoy the visual beauty of Alaska in this film.  But, this is in no way "high definition"  It looks the same as the regular DVD  (It's only $1 more, so not worth the hassle of returning) </p>

 <p> great photography, but NOT High Def </p>

 <p> This is wonderful for the family. Super shots of scenery and animals (the latter with good humor as well). Charleton Heston's narration is apt and not overdone (though the volume is a bit low as compared with the otherwise excellent music soundtrack that is Aaron Copeland-esque). A very nice intro to the glories of Alaska, it even includes a bit of history on the Gold Rush. </p>

 <p> Imax takes you to Alaska, and this will have the goose pimples going for a while.  Wonderful cinematography, and a superb narration by the late Charlton Heston.  It's a great journey, and the highlight is the bubble-net fishing excursion of the whalesequence.  Of course, we won't forget the rest of the animal kington, from the bears to the salmon.  If you want to really show off your big screen media room, this one is for you. </p>

 <p> This is true cinematic excitement! </p>

 <p> I was attracted to the movie by my wife who is a big polar bear memorabillia collector.  Though it's only an hour in length, it's scenic beauty will blow you away.  Can you imagine what it looks like on an IMAX movie screen?  WOW! </p>

 <p> I love nature and I love my high-end audio-video system...The IMAX series discs offer like minded people to get a trully awesome visual eye-feast.The narration by C.Heston fits the somber,harsh yet beautiful imagery of this  DVD.I know some people complain that for the money its to short.However,the  thrill of seeing such sharp,clear,pristine views in my view,makes up for  it.And,until more networks broadcast true HDTV programs,this is the best us  nature lovers can get! </p>

 <p> Another visual feast! </p>
