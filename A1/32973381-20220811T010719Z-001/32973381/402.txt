 <p> I was expecting a little more from this one. It sounded good from the description, I was expecting an experienced dom. But the part that really turned me off was the when they went shooting. Keaton showed professionalism with a gun. Pointing it to the ground, never pointing it at something he 'didn't want to shoot'. Until he decided to use it as a toy. While it had a live round in it. The gun enthusiast in me had a huge problem with this. Granted the scene lasted but a few paragraphs, but it was enough.I said earlier I was expecting a more experienced Dom. Keaton has hidden from his dark desires until now. Which isn't a bad thing. But I'm uncomfortable with novels that don't include peace of mind. He didn't give Maddie a safe word and they both had hopes he would stop if things got to far. It wasn't full blown bdsm, mostly some elements of bondage and spanking, but it still left me feeling uncomfortable.I did, however, like the symbol of the key. I thought this was interesting and clever on the authors part. I liked what it represented. </p>

 <p> A good story about power and those that wield it well - especially in the bedroom. Keaton knows a thing or two about how to take a luscious revenge. </p>

 <p> Although I don't practice it in real life, I enjoy reading about D/s in romantic fiction, and through those books I've got a pretty good idea of the rules that govern this community. "Safe, sane, and consensual" seems to be rule #1, and Keaton violates all three.The author assures us several times that he wouldn't actually rape her, but Maddie doesn't know that. As far as she knows, she has to do anything he says otherwise she goes to jail. Not exactly consensual.The stress of the situation causes Maddie to stop eating, which Keaton realizes but doesn't meaningfully address until she passes out. A responsible Dom would have had more regard for her safety. Strike two.Finally, during their visit to a gun range(!), Keaton places a LOADED GUN at her chest. This is erotic?? Forget D/s, this behavior violates common sense, every tenet of responsible gun ownership, and may even constitute criminal menacing. It makes Maddie deeply uncomfortable and makes Keaton look insane. 0 for 3, Keaton.The writing here isn't terrible and I would give this author another chance, but I found the Keaton character disturbing, which distracted from the romance. </p>

 <p> IN DEBT TO THE DOM is a quick and sexy read, featuring a hot and loving Dominant that made me want to turn to a life of white-collar crime!This erotic novella was hot. There were lots of sensual and sexy love scenes between Maddie and Keaton, but there was a romance developing between them as well. The chemistry between them was palpable, as they navigate a Dominant/submissive sexual relationship together and it seemed to click for them. I really liked the main characters. Maddie had to deal with some crappy circumstances, but she was a fighter. And Keaton...well, he was just amazingly hot and dominant, and I love that. I didn't particularly like the Maddie's sister, but I think that was the whole point.There was also this central theme in the book with a key. It was symbolic but also very erotic. I don't want to give too much away, but every time the author mentioned a key, I got all tingly. Along with establishing their relationship, the book also focused on why Maddie stole the money and what ultimately happened to Maddie's sister. That subplot was interesting and gave the story more substance than just sex.Although the story was short, it was still developed well. I felt that the pacing of the story was appropriate because although their relationship moved quickly, they were basically together all the time for a month. I think it's much easier to fall in love with someone when you've been around them like that. The plot was also resolved as well.Ultimately, this was a highly enjoyable read: it moved quickly, had great characters, steamy love scenes, a good plot, and a nicely resolved happily ever after. This is my second Jan Bowles read, and both times I've been thoroughly entertained with her strong heroines and sexy alpha heroes.Reviewed by Rhofor The Romance Reviews </p>

 <p> After Maddie has problems that seem to just keep hitting her in her personal life she gets one more in the form of Keaton. Keaton thinks that Maddie is pretty and wants to get to know her on a personal level but Maddie has been burned before and doesn't trust Keaton's true motives. However fate has other plans for these too. Can love be enough to get over it all and is it safe to admit you love someone without feeling guilty? This is a great read definitely would recommend it </p>

 <p> I debated with myself for months whether or not to purchase this book right now and I'm so glad I did. Maddie is a hard-worker and she loves her family, so when she felt her family was in trouble of course, you try and help. Who knew she would be decieved. Well i guess in a way she should thank her family because the deceit brought Keaton to Maddie and a love for life that they both needed. </p>

 <p> This actually wasn't a bad read, I purchase this book a couple of hours ago and just finished it. I like that the moment I started the book it captured my interest and the rest just flowed easily throughout the pages. Maddie  has a great job and loves her job, she believes her sister has been kidnpped and sets out to pay the ransom for her sister's safety by taking the money from the company (let's just say all is not what it seems regarding her sisters kidnapping). Keaton who is the CEO notices the money is missing and decides to use the opportunity to finally Have Maddie in his bed.The title seemed very interesting when I first purchase the book, but I must say for those who likes the Dom/Sub while I love this read it wasn't hard core Dom/sub it was soft core on the scale, the sex was not lacking though, a good smooth quick read. I think I would look forward to reading more from this author in the future.************* </p>

 <p> This was a wonderful story. In the begining not much was explained and the female character was on a bit of a high horse but everything worked out wonderfully! The male character worked hard to look below the serface of events and trusted his instinkts both in bed and out. He did pull back after some of the details came clear which seems less dominant to some. But dominance is not always about being emotionless all the time every person does things they regret sometimes but this shows what we all wish would happen every time you have a rough start!This did not a a lot of elements of BDSM, or domination but it was a great story about people stepping into the lifestyle. </p>

 <p> Maybe the book deserves a 2 1/2 or maybe even a 3 from some readers, but I can not see it deserving 4 or 5 stars.  It wasn't really a very bad book but I do not consider it a great one.  I did not hate reading the book but I had no problem with setting it aside and reading or doing something else nor did I have any problem with deleting it from my Kindle after reading it.  It was interesting plot but just felt flat to me.  A great book in my opinion is one that draws the reader into the story - where you feel almost as if you are part of it whether it is Modern, Sci-fi or paranormal.After finishing the book, I had a hard time determining what it was exactly that I did not like about the book.  It is a light read and sweet but it just did not pull me in.  Maybe because it was too "easy to read" where it felt juvenile and too "uncomplicated" so that the plot fell flat and phony.  Finally I realized that it was just too "Polly Anna" for me to really enjoy.  That I really did not care anything about or for the characters.  Even the few descriptive sex scenes were just words that did not do a thing for me.If you like your books to be sweet, uncomplicated, easy reads, with a little graphic sex thrown in - then yes, you will enjoy this book.  Otherwise, I would recommend you pass on this book. </p>

 <p> This story was predictable and didn't make sense.*MINOR SPOILER ALERT* (About 30% the book) The sister who was tricked into taking money from her bosses company by her sister.She finds out her sister tricked her to get money, she never tells him about it to clear her name. I stopped reading it at that point. I did quickly search through the story to see if I might be mistaken and I wasn't, I knew how it would end and I was right. I like smart characters, I like plots where I think, "wow I didn't see that coming". I like Jan Bowles books, this one disappointed me. </p>
