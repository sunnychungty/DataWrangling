 <p> This is an excellent resource for families who are brave enough to tackle the parks of Walt Disney World (twice the size of Manhattan).  Geared towards 10-14 year olds, but suitable for all ages, this guide makes it possible to have a family planning session months before you buy the (very expensive) park tickets, so that everyone gets to see all that they can see in your given time frame and budget.  Tickets get cheaper the longer you stay, so plan on staying a while - you can't do it in a day anyway.It contains guides to all the cool stuff at the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom, plus descriptions of the rides, shows and attractions - (S (Scary), A (Awesome), T (Thrilling), D (Dark), or W (Wet); plus important information on the tricky FastPass system, and tips on hotels, restaurants and fast food places. (There's TONS of information on eating places).  Like the others in the series, there are also historical facts, maps and a test your knowledge quiz at the end.This guide even contains a suggested timetable for booking rides with the FastPass system (book now, ride later) giving tips on attractions close by to visit while you're waiting your turn.  A must-read if you're thinking of doing Disney with kids, or you may find yourself wasting time and money waiting for rides and attractions you may not be interested in, or that may not be suitable for some family members.(Note: The Universal Theme Parks' Priority Pass system is way better than the FastPass system, with MUCH shorter waiting times - Disney, please take note)Amanda Richards, October 11, 2011 </p>

 <p> Planet Explorers Walt Disney World 2013 is the perfect travel companion. It has a treasure mine of information not only for kids but for adults as well. It gives ratings to the attractions, when to get a Fast Pass, height requirements, along with a blurb as to what the attraction is about. It also gives the reader the choice of skimming for areas of interest or reading more in depth by clicking on the websites mentioned in the book. Being on my Kindle it would come in handy to bring along instead of dealing with large maps etc. </p>

 <p> Planet Explorers Walt Disney World 2013:  A Travel Guide for Kids </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> This book is billed as a travel guide for kids, but is just as useful for adults planning a trip to Walt Disney World in Florida. The author has really done a thorough job. She provides everything from the origination of the idea with Walt Disney and the history of the site to updates of most current information. There are maps and photos of street scenes, rides, restaurants, hotels and venues. The author advises the best way to negotiate the theme park as well as Epcot Center and how to find the fastest lines. Information on regulations, safety, and transportation is provided.Readers will learn about things like where to find the characters throughout the parks, lots of plans that were never carried out, and where to go to find the best entertainment, restaurants and hotels. Advantages and disadvantages of the resorts are laid out to compare and contrast. There is even an informal tour of the Disneyland Hollywood Studios and the Animal Kingdom. Schaefer teases us with lots of fun facts of which I was completely unaware. For example, did you know that the whole park is built over structures called utilidores? The actors and personnel can walk around freely underneath the park! The science fiction writer, Ray Bradbury, helped design and write the script for Spaceship Earth. No one visits the park without jumping on some of the famous rides so the author even provides a key to classifying them with the following code letters: S D T W or A. These letters stand for Scary, Dark Thrilling, Wet, and Awesome.The book is organized by the sections such as Magic Kingdom Park, Epcot, Movie Studio, Animal Kingdom. Entertainment, Special Tours, and Resorts. I can&#8217;t think of anything that has been left out. Near the end of the approximately one hundred twenty seven page guide is a list of Disney isms which explain its unique characteristics. Maps of the monorail and railroad are also included. Finally, the author writes a quiz to see how well you have been paying attention. She ends with last minute planning tips to remember before you embark on your trip.I have visited the Disney Park many times and still found so much I did not know about it in this guide. Some critics complain they would like to see it in book form, but I am very happy with this kindle version, which I will definitely review before my next trip to Disney World. Happy Travels! </p>

 <p> I used to devour Disney World books meant for children back when I was a kid.  But now that they are digital and on the Kindle, I cannot say that.  I like these but they aren't entirely the same as they were when it was just a hard copy book for me personally.  If you are a kid, or you are the parent of a kid who wants a travel guidebook for WDW for your kid, I would recommend you not look at this one.  As a WDW expert and multi-trip veteran since 1991, this book doesn't quite get there for me.  I've read many books, I've read the Unofficial Guide (which is merely okay) as well as PassPorter and I have even read Birnbaum books, and the occasional off-label ones, and this one is pretty dull as Disney guidebooks go.  Not exactly recommended. </p>

 <p> It's been said many times that "children are our future," and Planet Explorers has latched onto a truly novel concept: why not create a series of ebooks designed specifically to meet the needs of these future world explorers?  After all, kids these days are increasingly Matrix-literate.  Because this budding generation is going to be far more computer-friendly than the ones who came before (insert my name here), why not sprinkle these ebooks with hyperlinks selected to cleverly enhance the presentation?Planet Explorers has launched a line of travel ebooks specifically prepared for children aged 8-12, and I found their Walt Disney World volume to be a pleasant surprise.  Sure, it provides a comprehensive rundown to each of the magic kingdoms, but did you know it also highlights which attractions also merit one of those `fastpass' thingees?  Time is our most perishable resource, so why not suggest which rides and shows may require a bit more attention than others when maximizing the vacation experience?  Planet Explorers does this for you, and it's all provided in an extremely user-friendly electronic format.  In the mood for a burger in-between light speed water splashes?  Planet Explorers can point you in the right direction.  Want to know where you run the best odds of rubbing elbows with Buzz Lightyear?  Planet Explorers can give you the inside information.  Not only is all that information useful, but their guide to Walt Disney World is even healthily supplemented with information about the park's various peak moments in history, some snippets on its technology, and even some interesting side stories on the architecture's inspirations!  Who knows?  Young readers might well be influenced to want to further explore their home planet by wanting to know more about this thing called the Eiffel Tower after reading this ebook!  Everything a young reader could possibly need to know about preparing for his next sojourn to the Magic Kingdom is in here, and I'll bet there's even plenty of tips, tricks, and trivia to keep him searching for more.And, for the record, this old dog tried to learn a new trick by reading the ebook on a tablet.  You've heard about these things the kids want these days?  They're flat computers, basically.  Ipads and such?  Yeah, one of those them there things.  I wanted to see just how well the guide interfaced with all of those hyperlinks.  I'm pleased to say that it performed wonderfully.  And what a surprise the links were!  Cynical I may be, I had expected some re-directs for further advertising information that was essentially more graphics of the "happiest place on Earth," but I was surprised to see so many of them were actually informative, much in the same way Walt Disney's Epcot educates as much as it entertains on so many attractions.  Dare I say ... tomorrow's explorers might actually "learn a thing or two" whilst planning their next crusade?Planet Explorers Walt Disney World guide is a great book for young and old alike.  You shouldn't think twice about recommending this to your young'un to use for planning his participation in the next family vacation.  If these kids truly are the future, then let them plan the agenda.  Let them prioritize our various destinations.  Let them plot out our each and every step.  And you know what?  You may end up thanking yourself that you did.In the interests of fairness, Planet Explorers provided me with an electronic copy in order for me to complete this review. </p>

 <p> she is constantly sharing all kinds of trivia that she is learning about WDW by perusing this volume.  She is an aspie, and I got this for her to help prepare for our upcoming WDW vacation in November 2013.  She is really enjoying it, and it is fun for her to be able to contribute to our knowledge and planning.  It's great! </p>

 <p> Laura Schaefer writes really fun books for kids but adults will want to read them too. Reading one of her books is almost as fun as actually going to the location she is writing about. There are tons of pictures in this book and lots of good advice for getting around Disney World at your own pace. There are some special tips like "if an attraction has two lines, pick the left one."I went to Walt Disney World as a teenager and still remember the excitement of visiting the Hanunted Mansion, Space Mountain, the Swiss Family Treehouse and It's a Small World. I also remember spinning in a tea cup at the Mad Tea Party.  So reading this book brought back lots of happy memories.Now things I'd like to do on my next visit include going to the Boulangerie Patisserie for pastries and going to the Journey into Narnia. I'd also love to see the Bengal Tigers and go white water rafting.Basically to see everything you might want to spend a week and stay in some of the cool hotels. But if you only have a few days or even just a day this book will reveal all the fun things you can choose to do.~The Rebecca Review </p>

 <p> I'm a big fan of guidebooks for knowing how to get around a foreign city, and while paperback guidebooks are good, Laura Schaefer's Planet Explore books for kids are outstanding.  They are the future of guidebooks, at least for me, and while they were written for kids, I absolutely love them.  I hope Schaefer writes books for every city in the world, because she's really onto something good.  So what's so special about these books?I'm reviewing the Disney World book, so here's why it's so different from any paper back guidebook there is: These guidebooks are made for today's ipads, Kindle Fires, smart phones, or just about any device with the internet. With the internet, you can click the hyperlinks to be connected with any part of the book, or Wikipedia for more fun facts about Disney World.Included in these books, are special codes, initials to give you a clue as what exactly you'll be getting yourself into on certain rides.S is for scaryD is for darkT is for thrillingW is for wetA is for awesome.Combined with a list of places to eat nearby each ride, with such great details, that as a parent, I'd buy one of these guides for myself.At the end of each book, there's a quiz for kids to take, and map of the railway system so you know how to get around.  A list of Disney-sims such as:"Audio-Animatronics: a form of robotics created by Imagineers for Disney attractionsBackstage: areas of a park or hotel that are off-limits to guestsCast member: a person who works at Walt Disney World", and lots more so you can feel like you're an insider in the Disney World.There are travel tips such as, wear sunscreen, what to do if you get separated from your group, and what fast passes are all about and where to get them, if there are two lines, get in the one on the left and lots more.I can't say enough about this wonderful guidebook and how it can transform your trip into pleasure as you go confidently from attraction to attraction, with your own personal guide to show how to avoid all the pitfalls of all the unknowns in a foreign world.  I hope Schaefer makes a guidebook for Las Vegas next, for grownups of course . .  . </p>

 <p> This book is really good for any child or parent whether you are going to Disney World or just interested in it. It gives you history of Walt Disney, information on each land in disney world like frontier land etc. tells you the food places, what each location has, and the type of food. It's not a book with paragraphs its most in bulletin which is nice. I really enjoyed this ebook and would recommend it to anyone who is going to Disney World or just loves Disney its self! </p>
