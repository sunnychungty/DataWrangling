 <p> Wow. This book is absolutely amazing. It is so well written. You can really picture what is going on word for word. The writer really turned me on reading this one. I finished it a couple of nights ago but I still get certain sec scenes pop into my head occassionally. That is amazing. This book is the 1st from this writer, and I will definitely will be buying more. </p>

 <p> HOTT </p>

 <p> ello readers, wow, just um...wowzer this a book that will cause all types of blushing and moments of pause. This author does not write romance, absolutely doesn't, as she states in the back of this book. To quote &#34;There is nothing even remotely romantic about my stories. What you will find in the pages of my work is BDSM, smut, often consists of dubious consent, and is sometimes rather harsh.&#34; This book readers even has a disclaimer stating you might be offended with the story and all that it entails. So, it's Christmas time, you're working as an elf and will be spending your Holiday single since your jerk boyfriend and you have called it quits. So, now Santa also known as the gorgeous toned Josh gets word that one of his poker buddies has just backed out and asks Tara also known as Santa's little helper to come and fill in. Sure, why not? After all Josh is hot and you've got no plans so why not? So, it all sounds great until when Tara arrives and four men begin undressing her literally... does she want what they're offering? It isn't poker, but it does involve the table, and a bunch of other toys, locations, and did I mention four men? This is quite the short tale, I mean wow, usually erotic tales like this are but a single scene and the big finale and nothing more, this though had a beginning to lull us in and then things quickly escalated and just when you think okay that's done, phew...wowzer, it continues, and continues and continues....phew. Your toes will curl you may bite your lip and you'll probably leave with quite a few ideas and maybe be a little surprised at yourself but damn. This is not a romantic tale readers it's really just about sex and heavy kink like wow... I was a little afraid at times. Still, if you want a very kinky BDSM tale with a not so Christmas theme...then by all means check this tale out. Phew... I say...phew. </p>

 <p> Phew...not a romance book not at all, but if you're into bondage and kink it's for you. </p>

 <p> There's preferences for everyone, and some might not like the following: m/m/m/m/f, BSDM. Otherwise, you'll enjoy this intensely erotic short story that actually ends in a sweet tone.Hits all the right spots. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Love it </p>

 <p> I Don't know why I bothered reading this piece of trash! maybe because I got it for free?! even then it's not worth the time or effort to even read it because it was nothing romantic about being abused during sex.pure garbage! </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> What a sorry excuse for a book! </p>

 <p> I love a hot, sexy book as much as the next girl (or guy), but this was pure porn that was delivered in a very demeaning (sp?) way. Really, what girl wants five guys to use her in the way that they did to help her get over a former relationship?  This had to be written by a man. Completely horrible. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> horrible </p>

 <p> I think this was one of the most brutal sexual attacks I have ever read. It was truly an unplanned feast on her part as Santa's Helper but did Santa and his friends have a great time, wanting another round. Wow. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> A royal feast!!! </p>

 <p> This story is about being in love with someone who doesn't have any idea that you are in love with them. You work with them everyday, but they don't know how you feel. It was nice when she finally got her man, and he felt the same way. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Nice Story </p>
