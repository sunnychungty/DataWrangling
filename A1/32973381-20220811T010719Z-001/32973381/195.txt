 <p> I love BBC and A&E Series My all time favorite series  Pride and Predijudice, was a major hit. But I honestly don't get where they were going with this series. I was diasppointed in the quality and this is not a movie I would share with the whole family </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I just finished this series and was particularly struck by the last two DVDs, "The Mutiny" and "Retribution."  Together, they tell the story of a mutiny that Hornblower helped to instigate.  The story begins with, and has a number of flashbacks of, Hornblower and the other ship's officers (most of whom are his sidekicks) being court martialed after the mutiny.  The penalty is death. Of course an important part of the plot is the suspense as to whether the officers are hanged and if so which ones.I am not sure if this was intentional, but the view of the judicial process is thoroughly cynical.  The three authorities running the court martial are not interested in the truth.  The captain whose command was taken away was not only paranoid and abusive, but psychotic, and his commands endangered everyone around him.  The authorities understand from the evidence (including that of the ship's doctor) that the captain had lost his reason.  However, they are firmly against publicly admitting it because the captain had been a celebrated hero in earlier days.  All the ship's officers participated in the mutiny.  One of three candidates--quite possibly Hornblower--tried to kill the captain by pushing him through a hatch.  The authorities agree outside the court that at least one officer should be hanged as an example.  One authority is Captain Pellew, Hornblower's old mentor, who is fond of him and argues with the others against hanging him--saying that Hornblower is very useful in the service and likely to continue being so. As far as I can tell the other authorities tell Pellew if he can pin the blame on at least one other officer to go ahead, so . . . well, you'll have to see how it turns out. </p>

 <p> This series is a wonderful high seas adventure.  Having a huge interest in maritime history, especially in  the 18th and 19th century British Navy I was immensely excited to view this series.  When I purchased this set about two years ago I had already seen "Pirates of the Caribbean" and "Master and Commander".  Both films being a fantastic nautical adventure especially "Master and Commander" I wasn't expecting too much from the Hornblower films.  I knew they were made-for-tv movies, and films that go strait to television are not usually quite on the same level as theater releases.  I was completely surprised with the Hornblower movies.  I was so enthralled with these films that I watched them all in one day.I immediately enveloped myself with Horatio Hornblower.  He is a very likable character and one just cannot help but root for him throughout the whole series.  These films did a great job with historical fiction.  The uniforms, accents, appearances, and ships were very accurate for representing navy life during the Napoleonic Wars.  I found it pleasing that the filmmakers did a fine job presenting the different ranks in the Royal Navy and what was expected out of each crewmember.  It was very fascinating to see the progression of a midshipmen and what he had to do in order to become a lefttenate and eventually a captain.  I could really understand how full grown men in the crew would have a hard time taking orders from midshipmen who were basically teenage boys from well-to-do families.  It's fantastic to see how Horatio truly earns their respect while keeping with the regulations of the navy.I think the true magic of these films is the relationships that build between Horatio, his crew, fellow officers and captain.  Especially how Captain Pellew and Horatio begin a father and son type of relationship.  The great thing about a series is that one is able to see the progression of characters in many different levels throughout a paced time instead of already having them in place or either rushed in a two hour film.  As far as the effects in the films they are not quite at the level of a Hollywood blockbuster but they are still impressive and work just fine.  The extras on some of the dvds are really neat.  There is a short documentary on life in the British navy and HMS Victory, plus a cool documentary on midshipmen of present day and modern sail training on the USS Eagle.  If anyone has an interest in maritime history, high sea adventure or just wants a heart filled epic with well-done acting, this masterful series is highly recommended. </p>

 <p> This new complete set of the adventure of Horatio Hornblower is great. It is about a boy trying to become a man, a man struggling to become a leader. The first four movies are individuals, but the other two are not.The distinguished in the fifth part-"Mutiny" -that it makes you angry, whereas the sixth part- "Retribution"- makes you confuses.And when the captain James Sawyer was locked up and provokes his first lieutenant Bukland, he reminds me with Dr. Hannibal in the Silence of the lambs. And I did not like the way the four lieutenants wears theirs military hats, I think if they wear it in the normal way it would be better.And what is the point of Horatio Hornblower nudity scene? It is an Action/Adventure movie, not an erotic movie! </p>

 <p> It is a joy to follow Horatio Hornblower's  &quot;journey&quot; as a young officer in HM Navy. From the beginning it is clear that HH is more than just one of the &quot;young gentlemen&quot;. His ingenuity and wits makes him stand out from the rest. He succeeds in doing his duty using his abilities in a way which gains him the trust and admiration of the men above and below him.Ioan Gruffudd's performance as Horatio Hornblower and Robert Lindsay as Capt. Pellew are indeed outstanding, as well as the rest of the cast.Part 5 and 6 let you see how much more HH has grown into his role as a leader. David Warner as the quite insane Capt. Sawyer is brilliant.A MUSTSEE ! But  beware, it can become an addiction......... </p>

 <p> Usually women steer clear of "war story" type stuff, but in this case, don't!  It's much more than cannons and battles.  This series is filled with fantastic character work and excellent relationships between the main cast.  (Cherie Lunghi is a standout in "The Duchess and the Devil" as a canny, trustworthy-or-not Duchess, and the rest of the cast is absolutely worth the price of admission.)  You see the main character grow plausibly from a promising upstart to a seasoned leader climbing the career ladder, and forging strong friendships and gaining the devotion of his men along the way.  It's a real ensemble cast, with all of the supporting characters given real, textured personalities.  Definitely a great set of DVDs for a girls' night in!The only reason it's getting only four stars is that the "making of" information is paper-thin and more of an advertisement for the series itself than a real exposition on the creation and execution of the series itself.  I don't need what amounts to a commercial for the show and can't see the logic of having it on the DVD set; obviously, if I bought the DVDs, I didn't have to be sold on it.  I would much rather have had real technical information on the adaptation of the novels, the filming, and the post-production. </p>

 <p> I just read the Hornblower novels and happened to see "Loyalty" on cable TV.  I was blown away and then learned that there were seven more episodes, so I purchased this set, which is the best mini-series I've seen.  Its production standards are almost equal to a feature movie, including the sets, photography, actors, costumes, etc.  My wife, who has no interest in the Royal Navy, even got hooked.Don't hesitate to purchase these DVDs, especially if you have read the Hornblower novels.  Even if you haven't, you may well decide to do so after watching. </p>

 <p> I have come to this series late, even my 88 year old mother had seen it on TV and loved it; so how bad is that when she beat me to it? Recently my boss watched this, and when he finished he immediately went to the Library to get the books. I knew then it MUST be good. A friend lent me his set and I watched the last one last night; truly it's such a let down when it's over. I too am in the process of buying a set of these, all 8, and will watch them repeatedly. My favorite part of this story is the interaction between Pellew and Hornblower. Pellew is terribly fond of Horatio, is basically his father figure, and their scenes together are always superb, sometimes heartrending. Robert Lindsay is wonderful as Capt. Sir Edward Pellew, and it goes without saying how believable Ioan Gruffudd is as Hornblower. It's also great to see the British when they basically 'ruled the world' and the sun didn't set on their empire. The only other series I can compare this to is "Island at War," which is also absolutely excellent. Oh, I had to laugh, someone on here mentioned their next pet would be named "Horatio." I have to confess, I had thought the exact same thing! All in all, this series is worth whatever it takes to own it. </p>

 <p> This captivating mini-series has everything you would want in an adventure series: gallantry, intelligence, plots that engage your imagination, characters that you care about and actors that are at the top of their form.The historic and naval details are just enough to make you appreciate the authenticity of the series, but does not bog down the plot with too much minutiae.The script is witty, and compelling and not a word is wasted or meaningless.  Every word out of Pellew's mouth is a gem and every look on Horatio's, Archie's or Bush's face speaks volumes.The cast will soon become favorites whom you will look for in other films, but their work in HH may just be their best ever.I suggest that you buy the series, because one viewing of this magnificent series, is not enough. </p>

 <p> Before Patrick O'Brian (who is justly due all accolades) there was the Hornblower series by C.S. Forrester, which has screamed for big screen treatment for decades.  Before A&amp;E tackeled the series, the best we have had is the old B&amp;W Gregory Peck version caled &quot;Captain Horatio Hornblower&quot; which merges several of the middle books (the oldest ones) together.  It was a good movie, but standard Hollywood stuff.The A&amp;E series starts with Book 1 &quot;Midshipman Hornblower&quot; and works up from there.  The charcterizations are good and the screenplays, while taking inevitable liberties, are more or less faithful, especially in the characters of Hornblower and Bush.  (My favorite was &quot;Lieutenant Hornblower&quot;, Forrester's most complex novel in which Hornblower is caught up in a mutiny against a paranoid captain, and then has to extemporize an assault on a Spanish fort.  The A&amp;E series is at its best in this story, and keeps us guessing, as does the book, whether the ambitious Hornblower pitched his captain down the larbord stairs to save his neck and that of his fellow officers.)Ioan Gruffudd (not a household name, although he had a small part in Titanic) is a supurb young Hornblower.  There is strong support by the Kennedy and Bush characters, as well as Captain Pellew.There will be inevitable comparisons with &quot;Master and Commander,&quot; which I deem unfair.  By the time &quot;Master&quot; begins, Cameron Crowe's Jack Aubrey is already a seasoned captain.  In &quot;Hornblower&quot;, we see Gruffudd's Hornblower evolve into his rank, making mistakes and learning.  The Aubrey-Maturin novels are more complex, but Hornblower is one of the finest characters ever developed in the genre, and the success of the A&amp;E series is how this is captured.The A&amp;E series was not a theatrical release and is not nearly as big on scale or special effects.  None of ships actually used in the Hornblower series are particularly large, and do not match their historical counterparts.Recommendations:  I loved both the Foerrester and O'Brian series, and re-red them from time to time.  They are like Port and Madiera, each have their use. </p>

 <p> Although the Horatio Hornblower DVDs derive from an A&E; "made for television" miniseries, all of the episodes are of movie quality. The acting is just great, the stories are wonderful, and each one stands very well on its own, although the episodes are best if watched sequentially. The sets and effects are very well done.For those who don't know, the Horatio Hornblower series of books was written by British author C.S. Forrester, and deals with the career of a fictional British naval officer during the Napoleonic Wars. The series is somewhat faithful to the books, but significantly departs from the books in a number of places. But this is all to the good--purists (such as myself) will not be offended by this.This is a "must have" for anyone who likes war movies. Each episode contains a solid storyline and chronicles Hornblower's growing leadership abilities. These are tails of adventure, leadership, hardship, and war. Very little gratuitous violence--young children and adults alike will enjoy this series. </p>

 <p> What a great buy .... more than 10 hours of fabulous entertainment, a truly well acted, written, scripted and filmed mini series that you would be hard pressed not to just sit there and veg out for all six discs at once.The fact that the used sets, even for a DVD set release in 2002 are selling used in Amazon at practically the same price as a new set certainly attests to the demand of this quality DVD set! WOW ... I do not know how big the release on this set was but once this set sells out it will most certainly become a classic and pretty pricey. No wonder this movie was an Emmy winner ....The producers certainly spared little money on the sets, locations, script writers and trying to maintain historical accuracy. Unlike the movie 'Master & Commander .... give me a break please ....' the stories of Hornblower, written by CS Forester are historically correct and do NOT have French and British naval ships fighting in the Pacific Ocean for some dumb reason or another.... The sea battles are outstanding, the British naval officers are depicted in a very true to life manner as being the unquestioned supreme being on their ships. If I had only one comment though I was kind of surprised to see Horatio being taken out of ' the hole'  in a Spanish prison, after some days in the hot hot sun, wearing a crisp clean shirt, almost shaved .... hey he didn't even have a bathroom in that pit ... what gives ... LOLA couple of other things that really bother me for the critical 'DVD purists' in our midst. One, it only has an English soundtrack and only the first four DVD's have English subtitles. Dumb ones too cause I think they were made for the hearig impared rather than for subtitles since we get A LOT of 'bell tolls ... bird squaks .... men groan ..'  The last two disks of the series don't even have that, and even though I do think I speak English the subtitles do help, in many scenes, to understand the English accents of the sailors. And whats with the last two DVD's not having ANY subtitles no matter how aggravating?The second thing that bugged me is that this movie was only cut in Dolby 2.0 digital ...  what in the world were the producers thinking with that one? This is a fabulous movie for soundtrack battles and a Dolby 2.0 .... shame on you! Seems to me that unionized sound/sound track editors and subtitle people people in the UK were too expensive .. a major shortcoming but not enough to knock a solid 5 star rating ...Appart from those two foibles this is a technically exceptional  DVD set .... you can't go wrong ..... </p>

 <p> Like many people, I read the Hornblower series of books by C.S. Forester when I was growing up and loved them.  I have now seen the entire series on DVD and the films are almost as good as the books.  That is high praise indeed for all those involved in this impressive series of movies.Set at the beginning of the French Revolution, Mr. Midshipman Hornblower is a seventeen year old who has just signed on to learn all the ropes to skip and the ropes to know as a naval officer.  He is intelligent and he is eager to be the best he can be.  He is a handsome, talented young man who quickly comes to the attention of his senior officers, who put him in harms way early in his career.  Hornblower is more than ready for the task and he astonishes everyone, including the crew, with his creativity and daring.As the saying goes, the sea is a stern mistress and young Hornblower learns quickly that the sea is not his only problem.  He must face all the challenges of leadership in an English Navy which does not tolerate either weakness or mistakes.  He takes his punishment, just and unjust alike, without complaint.  He is the king's man and a patriot in the best sense of that word.His rise is swift.  First he becomes an acting Lieutenant, and then with a bit of luck, a fully commissioned officer.  His men watch first his bravery and then come to know the deep integrity of his character.  He neither lies nor will stand by and watch an injustice without standing up for the injured party, often at great peril to himself.  He is the definition of all that is good in a naval officer.These films are about good and evil, bravery and cowardice.  Never is there much doubt about the right course of action and Hornblower will always be found on the side of bravery and honor.  The filmmakers have spent lavishly on the many battle sequences that are part of each story.  These are action films that never insult our intelligence.  Good people die in battle, but Hornblower is one of the lucky ones to escape serious injury, while many of his comrades are not so fortunate.Ioan Gruffudd does a wonderful job bringing Hornblower to life.  Never for a moment do we doubt that there are such fine people and we feel better for that knowledge.  This is entertainment for the whole family.  Grab a bag of popcorn and get ready for an evening of adventure on the high seas. </p>

 <p> I had heard this series was pretty good but the British Royal Navy from 200 years ago didn't really interest me.  I'm glad I took another look at it and purchased this collection.  The Hornblower series has as much adventure and action packed into it as anything out in the theaters today, and when you combine that with some incredible writing and cinematography, you realize why this series collected so many Emmy nominations.I've never read the books by C.S. Forester, and I've heard that they're drastically better than this mini-series. If that's true I'll have to make sure I pick them up given how well this mini-series was produced.  I didn't think there was much you could do on a ship besides shoot cannons at other ships but they realy find ways to make these films work.  Through these 8 films we see the young Horatio Hornblower rise from the rank of a lowly midshipman to that of Admiral in the Bristish Royal Navy.  He progresses from an unseasoned youth with a fear of heights to the type of leader that everyone else strives to emulate and men would die for.For the price, you really get a lot of value out of these DVDs, which are cinema-quality.  You would never have guessed these were created for the small screen.  My one problem with them however is that this is not the "Complete" Hornblower series.  There are 8 movies total, which follow a fairly well-defined chronology, and this is missing the most recent: "Loyalty" (AKA Horatio and the Hotspur) and "Duty."  Even without these two films it's still a great collection, but with these last two it really completes the series. </p>

 <p> Ioan Gruffudd stars as hunky Horatio Hornblower in this must-have Nautical A&amp;E masterpiece. My only problem with Horatio Hornblower DVD set....Is that it isn't longer! This series stars when Horatio is a teenager, and progresses through his Lieutenancy. Horatio must endure hazing, evil crewmembers, disease, starvation and civil war. The scenes on this ship were beautifully filmed, and the costumes authentic looking. I cringed with horror along with Horatio, at the scenes where the crew must eat seabiscuits with maggots, and where Horatio is beaten, starved, and forced to remain on watch for 36 hours straight!As can be expected, Horatio endures these horrors like a trooper, and his friends endure along with him. I really cannot recommend this series enough. It beats most anything that's playing in the theaters today! </p>

This collection looks as though it has more extras on it than the ones previously released on DVD.Excellent acting - Ioan Griffudd is a delight, and the supporting cast is exquisite! </p>
