 <p> The Crooked Man is a wonderful, self-contained gem of a story. You absolutely don't have to read volumes 1-9 before you read this. This is a great place to start. The story is set in Appalachia. I'm a Tennessean, Scots-Irish, and I love bluegrass. The story captures something really cool and unsettling about Appalachian folklore and witchcraft, seeming authentic w/o making fun of the stupid hillbillies. It's a jewel. </p>

 <p> The last Hellboy collection had some pretty shocking revelations and events... so it's kind of a letdown to find out that  "Hellboy Volume 10: The Crooked Man and Others" doesn't follow up on that. Instead, this collection is various smaller stories featuring the scarlet anti-hero -- a grimy Appalachian adventure, plus a handful of other little stories.In the title story, Hellboy is called to Virginia to deal with a child who's been "witched." With the help of a mountain man named Tom, Hellboy finds the witch who cast the spell... and discovers that she's just a pawn for malevolent hags living deep within the mountain. And even worse, those grotesque witches are led by a monstrous creature called the Crooked Man -- and he wants Tom, body and soul.Then there's the one-shots. "In the Chapel of Moloch" brings Hellboy to a Portuguese village, where an artist has been putting out some really grotesque works, courtesy of his studio's gruesome history. "The Mole" was a special for "Free Comic Book Day": Hellboy notices a weird purple spot on his hand, which gets bigger and bigger and... well, better read it.And finally there's "They That Go Down To The Sea in Ships" (what else would they go down to the sea in?), a story from Hellboy's BPRD days. A small-time psychic/fortune-teller steals an old skull that once belonged to Blackbeard -- and now it's up to Abe, Hellboy and a historian to stop the cycle of death.I felt a little let down when I found out that this collection of Hellboy stories wouldn't pick up the plot threads that the previous volume left dangling. But "Hellboy Volume 10: The Crooked Man and Others" is still a solid little collection of stories -- think leprous mountain witches, giant centipedes, zombie pirates, and a building filled with the evil of Moloch.And though brief, Mike Mignola spins up some creepy supernatural one-offs, handled with Hellboy's typical matter-of-fact attitude ("I kinda wish I'd taken a shot at her back when she was sitting on that horse"). Even better, Mignola infuses a real sense of evil and menace into his stories, as well as a vaguely Lovecraftian vibe in "They That Go Down...", although "The Mole" is so quick that you barely have time to react to it.And as usual, Mignola's art is awesome -- a little blocky, dark and rough, with lots of distorted faces and splashes of red. But Jason Shawn Alexander's art in "They That Go Down..." isn't quite up to Mignola's standard; it's decent, but not nearly as atmospheric.As for Hellboy... he's Hellboy. Brash, rough, matter-of-fact and surprisingly soft-hearted towards ordinary humans caught up in weird events -- and it's fun to see him kung-fuing a giant stone statue of Moloch. And the character of Tom is an excellent one, a normal guy who stupidly got caught up in black magic as a kid and has been trying to live a good life ever since then."Hellboy Volume 10: The Crooked Man and Others" is a solid collection of odds and ends -- but they all center on Hellboy and his weird adventures. A nice addition to the collection. </p>

 <p> H.P. Lovecraft is arguably the biggest pulp influence on the Mignolaverse, but in "The Crooked Man," Mike Mignola takes a break from the normally cosmic goings-on to pay tribute to another writer from the classic "Weird Tales" roster: Manly Wade Wellman.In 1958, Hellboy, still working for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense, sets cloven foot into the mountains of Appalachia, where the terrain may be sunnier on the surface but whose forests hide hillbilly witchcraft as black as the farthest reaches of the Old Ones' domains. The locals, complete with corncob pipes, are convinced that a woman in an open-eyed coma has been hexed by a witch named Cora Fisher. Tom Ferrell, a former member of the community who's reminiscent of Wellman's character Silver John, has returned after 20 years and found evidence of said hexing.Hellboy and Tom head farther up into the mountains to find Cora. They face a zeppelin-chested seductress (a longtime specialty of artist Richard Corben) and the legacy of dark vows Tom swore as a teen to a devilish thing known as The Crooked Man, one of Corben's creepiest-looking creations. "One look at him scared all the bad thoughts right out a me. I lit out for home, swearin all the way to be good again." But Tom, like Cora, has been "bought an paid for," and The Crooked Man is a possessive owner (no pun intended).Mignola says he wrote "The Crooked Man" specifically for Corben, who "really delivered the goods." I enthusiastically agree. I don't think even Mignola himself could have nailed the art any better. As the corporate clots at Marvel and DC continue to display their willingness to trample their own legacies for a quick buck (or 4 bucks rather) with 52 this or Ultimate that, it's heartening to read a title that's so obviously a joyful labor of love that holds its forebears in reverence while freshly renovating decades-old material. "The Crooked Man" is one of the all-time great Hellboy stories and one of the most frightening horror comix since Alan Moore days on "Swamp Thing."The backup stories in this volume are fine but not in the same class, though "In the Chapel of Moloch" is written AND drawn by Mignola (interpreting Goya yet!), which is always an occasion for fanboy squee. The book also appends an appreciation of Manly Wade Wellman by pulp authority John Pelan for those who might not be familiar with Wellman's contributions to the weird tale. </p>

 <p> Giving Hellboy several decades worth of adventures to draw upon allows Mike Mignola to offer new readers a "jumping-on" point with miniseries that stand (mostly) apart from the ongoing "contemporary", epic Hellboy narrative. We get four such adventures here, most notably the title three-parter.Mignola pays homage to American supernatural-fiction great Manly Wade Wellman with an adventure in the American Appalachians of the 1950's, Wellman's setting for the first few stories of supernatural battler John the Balladeer (Who Fears the Devil?, The Hanging Stones). It's a lovely, respectful homage to the singular Wellman's tales of rural good and evil.Hellboy and a young man whose personality and background (but not his name) suggest those of John before his adventures began fight witches and devils in backwoods country, to pleasing and disturbing effect. Richard Corben's art has never been better, at least from a horror standpoint -- the Crooked Man himself is a truly creepy creation, as are many of the monsters and ghosts and bizarre insect things which assault Hellboy and company. As Wellman did, Mignola skillfully blurs the line between invented terrors and terrors derived from actual Appalachian folklore and myth.The rest of the volume sees Hellboy and Abe Sapien take on Blackbeard's ghost (well, skull) in a story penned by Joshua Dysart, and a confrontation with the ancient, child-eating god Moloch in Spain, the latter in a story with conscious echoes of Lovecraft's "Pickman's Model" and J. Sheridan LeFanu's "Green Tea." Oh, and Hellboy plays cards with some ghosts and worries over a suspicious-looking mole on his hand. </p>

 <p> I enjoy the Hellboy movies and now the comics so wanted to try one on my new Kindle 8.9.  I love it!  If you enjoy Hellboy, too, I recommend it.  The paper comics are nice but this allows you to see each frame individually on the Kindle.It's fun stuff in a crazy world. </p>

 <p> This is among my favorite Hellboy collections I've read up to this point. While the stories contained within aren't connected, they manage to maintain a similar tone throughout. As always the artwork is great and it's told with a distinctive voice. I recommend this to anybody he enjoys other Hellboy and alternative superhero comics. </p>

 <p> This book is the perfect graphic novel, and what I mean by that is (a) they've raised the quality of the graphics for it.  It's not your run-of-the-mill semi-graphic novel, like so many of them seem to be these days, don't they.And (b) it's not at bottom still a comic-book story either, as so many of them are.  And I might say, if you don't mind my doing so, that one of the reasons I like the writing of it so much is that I'm a bit spiritual myself, and I can vouch for the truth of about 3/4 of this story (the rest isn't necessarily untrue, I just don't know about it) (and I plan to keep it that way, but you can't fight fate, especially when you're dealing with someone so tricky).While we're on the subject, I was reading 'R. Crumb Draws the Blues' the other night, and that's got some moments in it that have to do with powers being derived from the dark side of spirituality (African voodoo).  And it's non-fiction.  It's interesting (always nice when someone else gets the information for you!). </p>

 <p> "The Crooked Man", despite being Vol 10 in the Hellboy series, isn't a continuation of the events of the previous book but rather a collection of shorts written by Mignola and illustrated by the best comics artists around. While I would've liked to see what happened after Vol 9, "The Crooked Man" more than makes up for it by providing story after story of high quality, brilliant storytelling and art."The Crooked Man" showcases Richard Corben's artwork as Mignola takes Hellboy into rural North America to fight mountain witches and the devil himself. The depiction of the devil, or "The Crooked Man", is truly amazing as are panel after panel of ruined churches, idyllic countryside, and horrifying creatures. If you're a Discworld fan and always wondered what Granny Weatherwax entering the body of an animal might look like, you get to see the graphic depiction here. It's the best story in the book and can easily see why it won an Eisner award in 2009.Jason Shawn Alexander (the guy who drew "Abe Sapien: The Drowning") lends his talents to a tale of a headless pirate Blackbeard, while Mignola himself draws "In the Chapel of Moloch", a Goya-esque tale of demon worship. The fanciful strip "The Mole" rounds out this superb collection with the inimitable Duncan Fegredo drawing beautiful countryside vistas, a ghostly poker game, and a derelict house with equal skill.Totally worth reading whether you're new to Hellboy or not, it's an amazing book and a fantastic contribution to one of the best comic series around. </p>

 <p> Wow, the first Hellboy to be largely driven by artists other than Mike Mignola (and a precursor to Mike Mignola's Hellboy, Weird Tales, which would be wholly driven by artists other than Mike Mignola).This one starts off with the title story, written by Mignola, and drawn by the exquisite Richard Corben, with his irrational non-technical style of chubby humans and half-finished backgrounds. In the insightful white-paper introduction that precedes all of is story, Mignola gives some background to the tale, noting in particular that he'd waited far to long to explore the American backwoods as a spooky setting for another Hellboy-on-a-Ghostbusters-mission tale. &#34;For my money, nobody draws better scruffy trees, twigs, and falling-down churches than Richard. I wrote this story specifically for him, and he really delivered the goods.&#34; Wow!Many of the tales in this book are about good people who've made mistakes in their youth and have turned away from God; so, too &#34;The Crooked Man&#34;, which involves many who've turned away from the path, and a few who wish that they were still on it. Tom Ferrell is one of them, and he returns to the town he grew up in to confront his past, and to clean up a little bit of the mess he left behind. The town is full of shattered lives&#8230; and there's Hellboy too! Bewitched folk, elderly people, witch balls&#8230; homely conversations witches in the forests, full as they are of scruffy trees, twigs, and falling-down churches. Tales of cat bones, the Crooked Man, frogs, the Korean war, tales of Effie Kolb, Tom's father, Melungean witches (in the mines), the crazy story of haunted Cora Fisher, her scaly insect demon hordes, and a final showdown in a church in the middle of nowhere (and, in the middle of it all, a nutty interlude on &#34;how to make a witchball&#34;; not sure if they should be teaching that sort of stuff to the kids&#8230;). The final panel is a doozy!&#34;They That Go Down To The Sea In Ships&#34; is a great tale of Blackbeard's headless ghost, illustrated by Josh Dysart. &#34;I'd heard how Blackbeard was killed (he was one tough monkey), but I'd never heard what happened to his head. Somewhere along the way I'd read a couple paragraphs about his headless ghost haunting a stretch of coastline looking for his head, so apparently he didn't know what happened to it either. I love stuff like that.&#34; The story is a fantastic tale of turnabout, with some wicked fighting, violence, and an inconclusive ending. Wow&#8230; a very Rob Zombie-ish Blackbeard!! This stuff is familiar now, with all the Pirates Of The Caribbean stuff going around, but it's still nice to have the ironic Hellboy twist to it.&#34;In The Chapel of Moloch&#34; is a cool Mike Mignola original about an artist and his agent in a haunted chapel in a small Portuguese village. Nice, I don't remember Hellboy ever visiting Portugal before. This one has all those weird &#34;ripping off Goya&#34; conversations that are too ironic and sarcastic. &#34;You think today's audience know who Goya is? Jerry's &lt;em>saving&lt;/em> Goya's ass. This series would have made the old boy relevant again.&#34; There's a fantastic battle with an ancient demon, and the story is resolved, fairly dustlessly.&#34;The Mole&#34;, the final tale, is an exquisitely drawn joke tale. Very funny, but also quite ambiguous. The empty skin scene reminds me of something from the first tale.Near the end of the book there's a Hellboy sketchbook, this time also containing interview notes with the artists themselves. Mignola notes that for the Moloch story he actually fashioned a small Moloch statue to draw from, and provides the photo of the crude clay object here, inspired as it was from the figure in the background of Goa's print &lt;em>Ensayos&lt;/em> (&lt;em>Trials&lt;/em>).At the end of the book there are some nice sketches, and also an essay about Manly Wade Wellman and the tradition of the &#34;occult detective&#34;. Mignola admits that Wellman had more influence than any on the creation of Hellboy, so it's interesting indeed to read this. </p>

 <p> Hellboy has been a long way from home for a while now. On those trips he's run into a lot of odd fellows. Here, we have a few of those tales, along with a few tales that are shorts and haven't been included in anything before. Personally, I thought the shorts were great, and having the insight into the process that Mignola utilizes is also great. In one of the stories, for example, he explains how he uses a statue of Moloch in the story and prepares a little clay statue so he can see all the angles. I like that. I also like the things you find out when you read the forward he puts in. In the mole, for example, you find out that it is based on an experience he had and on some "itch you can't scratch." Intersting how the mind works. Equally interesting are the people that inspire the tales.The Crooked Man is a tale of witchcraft and a personal journey we are witnessing, set in the backwoods of the Apps. The Crooked Man is freaky and some of the story is freaky as well, making it bizarre and interesting at the same time. When you look at it, look at the way Mignola's influences shine through in the tale - there's an area in the book that tells you all about it. if you already know Manly Wade Wellman's work, you can envision what is going on here.They That Go Down to the Sea in Ships pits Abe and Hellboy against a certain body and head that want to be reunited and that are not exactly the friendliest cast to walk the Earth. The way the art comes together with the tales of this person is great, taking all of the things that people have said over the years and putting them in the story. Honestly, I thought the subject of this was a good one because he's someone that people have heard odd things about - as a kid those things used to creep me out.In the Chapel of Moloch is a great story because it goes back to that true Hellboy feel for me. You have a painter that wants to do creepy work and that gets his own foreign studio/ chapel to work in. his partner sets him up and exhibition, too, and then leaves him to his work. When he returns, however, he finds the work undone and something built in the chapel that frightens him. and when Hellboy comes in, you know it gets worse.The Mole is just a short that is informative in soem way because it dwells on the fears. Even Hellboy has them, that's what the story says, and we know what he has haunting his mind.All in all, this is a great collection. You don't have to be schooled in anything to enjoy it but you don't have to be a novice to walk right up and play ball. Its good stuff - and it is something to divert from the massive story going on right now. Hellboy has great things inside and hopefully people see them all. I personally think this deserves a solid five. </p>
