<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I just saw Hemalayaa on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" and she had everybody up dancing and laughing! I loved her BOLLYWOOD DANCE WORKOUT and BOLLYWOOD BURN so I can't wait to try BOLLYWOOD BOOTY. Moves like "feed the chickens" and "screw in the lightbulb" are such a hoot that I barely know I'm exercising... </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Bollywood with a little bellydance </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Hemalayaa provides a warm-up that's pretty effective. The warm-up alone is worth having. I like that it's low-impact so that most people can do it. I do think certain sections of the workout would strengthen your thighs and your rear end. But Hemalayaa incorporates some high-impact exercises that seem more geared for cardio than for shaping your muscles.Sometimes her voice-overs are annoying, such as "Paint yourself ... infuse yourself with love." I prefer it when she just gives cues and encouragement. I don't need to hear, "All your cells are getting excited."For the most part, the music is motivating. The set is appropriate -- not too cluttered, but interesting.I liked that Hemalayaa incorporated some bellydance moves like the figure 8 and snake arms. Of course, she puts her own style on them. If you're going to get one of her Bollywood excercise workouts, I'd get this one instead of "The Bollywood Dance Workout." This one is far less silly and much more graceful.I'm not sure why the entire sequence of exercises was repeated. I would have preferred to have some different moves included instead. I wouldn't say that this is really four separate workouts. I'm not sure why it's marketed that way.But I really do like Hemalayaa as an instructor. I guess I'd just like to see her teaching a different kind of workout -- more structured and totally low-impact.Special features: There is a bonus classical Indian dance with Hemalayaa that's really more of a stretch. It might be good for getting your muscles to relax. Like yoga, it has some exercise benefits. But a lot of the symbolism is annoying. Everything seems to be a goddess pose or an acknowledgment to "mother earth." I guess I just prefer the professional exercise approach to the pagan imagery.Then there is the extra free-for-all "Liberation" dance with some other instructor which consists of a bunch of people just bopping around like monkeys. It's more like a meaningless music video than a workout. The voice-overs are silly and obnoxious ... "dancing for no reason at all." Yeah. I guess so. Who'd have a reason to dance like that? It's not even dance.The third extra is a Brazilian workout that is fairly high impact. It seems like it would be pretty fun on days when you have a lot of energy. You'll have to ignore the third performer, however, because he really doesn't fit in with his dreadlocks. I guess the makers of the video wanted to indicate that men could do the workout, too. Maybe they thought the wild look was better than the athletic look, but I don't agree. This is, after all, an exercise workout.Most likely I will want to just stick with the workouts by Hemalayaa. The last two special features are really previews of other DVDs. I'd be interested in the Brazilian one if the third performer didn't look so silly. But the "Liberation" one is worthless. If I want to dance freely, I'll do it. I don't need a DVD full of obnoxious chatter and people flopping around to do it. At least you don't pay for it, because it's just an extra. And you can skip it if you want. (I would.) </p>

 <p> This DVD is taught by Hemalayaa Behl, who appears along with two female background exercisers.  It actually offers four short workout segments (each less than 15 minutes in length) in addition to the warm-up and cool-down, thus allowing users to customize the total length of their workout time.  I have broken down each of these segments in greater detail below.>WARM-UP (4 min).  Here Hemalayaa introduces the "walk," a move that replaces the basic march seen in many other workouts.  This is sort of a hip sway from side-to-side, and she uses it in place, moving forward, and moving back.  She also performs mini-pli&eacute;s and teaches the arm movements that are used throughout the workout.  Although Hemalayaa gives the Indian names for these exercises, she explains them by asking users to envision everyday movements--e.g., lightbulb arms, painting the walls, etc.>WORKOUT 1 (5.5 min).  Hemalayaa calls this segment "Butt Monster Moves."  She returns to the mini-pli&eacute; introduced in the warm-up but adds many different variations, including toe taps, side reaches, butt kicks, leg lifts, etc.>WORKOUT 2 (8 min).  The first half of this workout includes a series of side-to-side lunge variations; Hemalayaa cues different arm movements (including "Indian vogue arms") and moves at a relatively quick pace.  The second half includes some pli&eacute;s as well as mini hops. Hemalayaa has you hop around so that you are facing away from the TV, and then you swivel just your head back over your shoulder while doing some fast hip flicks--this was a lot of fun!>WORKOUT 3 (12 min).  This workout begins with the swan, a figure eight move with the hips.  Hemalayaa adds in a hip flick, going back and forth from side-to-side and constantly changing up the tempo.  However, because the swan and the hip flick were the only moves in this longer segment, it started to feel quite repetitive after awhile.>WORKOUT 4 (11 min).  For this final section, Hemalayaa does not teach anything new; rather, she incorporates parts of each of the three prior workout segments above.>COOL-DOWN (3.5 min).  Hemalayaa concludes the workout by leading fluid, yoga-like stretching.Overall, Hemalayaa and her two female background exercisers really do seem to be enjoying themselves during this workout.  Although some of the moves WERE fun, I didn't find the workout to be very intense, and I didn't really find that it targeted my "booty" more than any other area.  This DVD is probably best suited for those looking for a very light, fun cardio workout--if you don't mind shaking your booty, Hemalayaa is likely to put a smile on your face. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I agree with the reviewer who said that a lot of the cueing & choreography are not performed with the rhythm of the music. This is mostly because Hemalayaa spends a lot of time telling you to 'play with the camera' instead of how to work the gluts! The 'butt monster' move,which was introduced in the beginning, was not challenging at all. In fact there are more torso exercises than those working the gluts. A lot of the glut action involves just plies, but Bollywood dance involves so much more than that. The last dance segment combined other dance segments with a slight variation instead of just creating a challenging dance sequence. By this time my body was bored, not tired. Thankfully there is a 5 1/2 minute segment of 'Brazilian Body' with Kimberly Mullen in the bonus features section. Now that really got the body going including the all important gluts!  Since then I've purchased that DVD which both challenging & enjoyable to practice. Therefore, I'll give Bollywood Booty an extra star for that extra segment of Brazilian Body. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> After tryingThe Bollywood Dance Workout With Hemalayaaand finding it fun albeit inadequate with regard to its ability to raise my heart rate and sustain it at an injury-free level, I was reluctant to devote 45 minutes of my time to "Bollywood Booty" and be disappointed.  Happily, I wasn't.Whether this DVD will reshape your backside as it promises, I do not doubt, but this depends upon the level of your fitness.  Repeated movements of this sort cannot help but redefine your butt.  However, Hemalayaa's derriere workout is limited to fast plies and side to side lunges that she incorporates to work within the pacing of a dance that she threads together in four separate segments that when played back to back equal the entire 45 minute program.  Squats are mentioned on the back cover of the case, but other than a repetitive backwards motion where one's back is flat and the rear end is thrust out with exaggerated hip movements, I do not recall any of the classic move being incorporated.  Hand and arm movements abound as well as full body undulations that Hemalayaa explains in exuberant voice-over as she stomps through the segments in happy abandon that one cannot fail to want to emulate. Caveat: Hemalayaa and her dance team do perform barefooted as I did. Simply don exercise footwear to prevent problems if your knees experience pain during jumping movements.Bollywood Booty is not billed as a cardio workout, therefore I did not expect to have an elevated heart rate throughout the routine.  With that thinking put aside, I was able to enjoy the DVD for what it was worth--as an do-able and entertaining routine that introduces the participant to Bhangra dance. As I sashayed, tic-toked, jumped and elked my way through the routine with a big smile on my face, I realized that Bollywood Booty delivered the fun it advertised. Maybe I wasn't sweating, but I got my body moving and felt good for the rest of the day.In addition to the four individual "Booty" segments, Bollywood Booty includes bonus dance features that act as advertisements for other Acacia products.Dance and Be Fit: Brazilian Bodylooked particularly appealing to someone like myself who wants to feel a little more intensity while performing simpler moves within the framework of dance.Bottom line?  If you are in reasonable fitness health, don't expect to be sweating profusely at the end of this 45 minute boot-ay sculpting session.  If you are accustomed to performing repetitive squats, lunges and other butt building exercises, you may be a little disappointed in Hemalayaa's offering.  Here, the moves fit together to enable the participant to perform a facsimile of a Punjabi dance (think the vibrantly happy dance fest inMonsoon Weddingor the train station stomp inSlumdog Millionaire) and relish the ebullient sensual feeling of moving sinuously with the beat rather than focus on slowly perfecting form.  Recommended as a smile-cracking alternative to the usual larger moves utilized in other butt sculpting DVDs.Diana Faillace Von Behren"reneofc" </p>

 <p> I know that probably makes me sound like a spambot, but I'm not kidding.  This DVD was an impulse buy at a store, and it was so much fun that I have bought a whole slew of dance workout DVDs here since.  I had hit a plateau in my weight loss before I started doing this workout, and I lost 20 pounds--a conservative estimate--after I started to do this workout everyday.  (I was rather heavy, so if you weigh 140 pounds, don't blame me if you don't lose as much.)This is the best of the Acacia Bollywood series that I've tried, which are the Bollywood Dance Workout and Beautiful Belly.  I haven't tried Bollywood Burn.  The others are too hard on my knees, but there is little hopping around in this one.  It still gets your heart rate going, and it is easy to do in a small space.  I highly recommend it!I also adore the bonus Odissi dance piece, and I wish I could get my hands on more of that. </p>

 <p> I got this video yesterdan and had been feeling sick all week and was just beginning to get over the flu.  I woke up early (5:30) to see if I could workout before going in to work and decided to give this a try.  What fun!I really enjoyed that I could choose which of the four workouts I wanted and that you can select the warmup and cool downs. I hate videos that let you choose individual sections of a workout without allowing you to select the warmup/cool downs.  I had a blast doing the workout and can tell that it immediately lifted my mood and energy level for the day.I look forward to the weekend when I can go through the whole video.  Definitely a fun workout for the morning. </p>

 <p> I wanted to like this video, but I can't say I do.Hemalayaa does all right in terms of enthusiasm. But she misrepresents some of the work that goes into "hip flicks," saying the movement comes from the hip.  It doesn't.  It comes from the knees and abs.  I have a problem with her bouncing movements as well. Only in this video does she acknowledge that hops can hurt a person's knees. The bouncing stretches, which she also uses on "Beautiful Belly," can cause injury. (So don't bounce, stretch. No workout should hurt you.)I have a hard time with her diction, too. I guess it's because I'm from a different generation, but I really do prefer hearing the correct terms (e.g., gluteus or glutes) rather than slang. I knew to expect the word "booty," but "Butt Monster Moves"?  A little too crass for me.I find the editing something of a problem because the cut-aways mess up what there is of a count system and when they come back to the dancers' actions, the dancers aren't moving in the correct direction. Sometimes even Hemalayaa is moving in the wrong direction. Oh, and Hemalayaa gets her left and right mixed up at times. Since she did a voice over, you'd think they would have fixed the problem. Or maybe they didn't notice. (Acacia People: next time try the workout a few times before you print the DVD!)Speaking of counts, they seem slapdash. I've counted out the movements. Sometimes Hemalayaa starts a new movement on 7 and others at 8. There are instances of 6 count steps, which occur with some predictability once you know what to expect, but she doesn't say so.  Even her own back up dancers seem to be confused every once in a while.The warm up is too short, warming up nothing at all and the routine itself is boring. It feels as if she just threw it together on a whim. That said, it gets the job done.What do I like?  Well, I do appreciate Hemalayaa's beauty and physique. I appreciate her enthusiasm. I think that maybe her yoga practice might be more inspiring, and I'd like to see her teaching traditional Indian dance, since her short dance presentation was lovely. I wish she'd talk a little more about the meaning of the mudra she used in the workout--because different mudras do have different meanings. It would only take a few seconds. </p>

 <p> Fun moves, good music.  You can follow along or improv.  Move the same or at your own pace.  Some moves are similar to the hula.  You will want to keep your feet on the ground during the brief jumping moves if you are older or if you have knee issues. </p>

 <p> I haven't had much luck with workout dvds in the past but I look forward to trying to master these workouts so I can be as graceful as Hemalayaa. Sometimes she does move a little fast but she always makes sure to mention that you should go at your own pace. I also like the fact she is very conscientious of people with knee problems (I don't have any though) and makes sure to announce with certain moves that you shouldn't bounce if it will cause problems. I really like that. Hemalayaa is fun and engaging and even though I look like a klutz right now trying to dance, she makes me want to keep on trying. The only problem is that I wish she had a separate section where she shows each move a little slower so I can practice them more before the actual workouts. I definitely recommend this dvd to anyone who wants to have fun and laugh while trying to learn fun exercises. </p>

 <p> On preview, I was not overly enthused with this workout but after finally giving it a try I found it was a lot of fun. Good for light/recovery days, you get about 40 minutes of continuous movement, enough that my headband was soaked when it was through. The pace is doable and the steps are very easy, though if you are uncoordinated like me, it might be a good idea to start with a belly dance basics DVD so that you can learn some of the movements as there are no actual "how-to" dance instructions. The sections are rather repetitive but for me that's a plus because I really need to work on my figure eights and hip bumps. (To be honest, I need to work on everything!) Hemalayaa has a stunning but approachable beauty and a warm deep voice--a joy to listen to even if her cues are not always where they need to be. She's a pleasant and encouraging instructor who makes the workout inviting, I'll be buying more of her DVDs. </p>

 <p> Rating is five stars, It could not be any less.  Yes, I am a male and I heard a lot from my female friends, sisters, and female coworkers about not having enough time to work out, its boring, takes away from the family, and ect. This DVD is in complete English.  I am going to put this in my face book page.  I have also ordered 7 DVDs for my female relatives, friends, coworkers, sister-n-law, and ex-wife.  So do I think highly of this?  You will hear words like Boo-tay walk, Swan, Tick-tock, Hip flick, and Over the shoulder.  This is more than exercise for the complete body.  It is the teaching of being Sensual....  Years ago, my ex  took lessons on belly dancing.  Then she was too embarrassing to show me. It seem to me ( a man) that American women/girls are embarrassed to show sensually unless it has to do with sex.  It is another way of dancing, flirting, and expressing oneself.  So I am giving copies of this DVD to my people. The ages are 20 to over 60.  Friends, this is for your health, your sensually, and your love life (husband or other person). </p>

 <p> I had a lot of fun with this workout but yet I was getting a real burn. I like the fact that you can choose to do 1, 2 or all of the segments depending on your mood and time constraints. It is nice to know you can fit in a workout even if you only have 15 minutes. I also like the music only option + the bonus workout (slower yoga style). This was new and different and I think it will be easy to stick with. I liked it so much I bought all the other newer workouts as well. Highly recommend! </p>

<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> whether you like it may depend on what you're looking for </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I'll say at the outset that I am not thrilled with this DVD, but your mileage may vary.  It all depends on what you're looking for in a workout DVD.First, some general comments on the production value.  The camera angle changes frequently, sometimes as often as every few seconds.  This is distracting and sometimes you can't even see what you need to see as far as the demonstration goes.  For example, in one segment, you reach your arm over your head with your hand in a mudra (hand position).  However, you do 5-6 reaches before you even see what the hand movement is.One way to overcome this problem is to watch the DVD in its entirety before attempting to do the exercises contained therein.  Then you'd know what to expect.The music is on an endless loop, which is somewhat annoying.  The other reviewers suggest that Hemalayaa is off-beat.  I don't notice this, but I have no rhythm and no dance background.  So if you are like me, this won't bother you.  If you have some dance experience, however, your opinion will likely differ.I think the set is nice (appropriate for the type of dance and not too cluttered) although the lighting is a bit dark.  The women behind Hemalayaa are mostly able to keep up and seem to know what they're doing.As a workout video, what this DVD lacks is cueing.  Hemalayaa's commentary is excessive (instead of just telling you what the moves are, she adds a lot of chatter) and she's doing more describing of the action than telling you what's next.  It's almost as if she's watching it for the first time, herself.  It doesn't give a feel of being choreographed, which is not a good thing in a dance workout.This DVD has six main segments, a warm-up, four "workouts," and a cool-down.The warm-up is short -- only about four minutes.  You do a lot of arm movements that you will need to remember later and, to be fair, you do move the entire body.Workout 1 is about five and a half minutes.  It involves a lot of plies, some with toe taps or kicks, and a variety of upper arm movements.  There's also some walking in place.  This one is fun, actually, but too short to properly be called a "workout."Workout 2 is eight minutes long.  You use the arm movements from the warmup a lot.  There are some lunges and hops here.  You should watch out for these -- there's no instruction as to how to safely perform these moves.  In the lunges, Hemalayaa's knees go way out over her toes, which most other workout DVDs recommend against doing.  And the hops are high-impact.  She tells you not to do the hops if it's hard on your knees, but doesn't offer an alternative move.  This segment also has some hip lifts and shimmies.Workout 3 is about twelve and a half minutes long.  It consists almost entirely of moving your hips in a figure 8 and hip flicks/lifts.  The last 2-3 minutes of this one have some additional moves.Workout 4 is about eleven and a half minutes long.  This is a collection of moves from the other segments and doesn't contain anything new.  While I could've dealt with the amount of repetition in the other segments, this one really drove home just how much repetition this DVD contained.The cool-down is only about three and a half minutes (the rest of this track on the DVD consists of the credits).  It's a pretty standard Hemalayaa cool down, with lots of forward bends and slow, flowing movements.  There's one part where you squat deeply, with your rear end almost to the floor and your knees sharply bent.  Be careful with this part, as it could be brutal if you have bad knees.  I have to back off in this segment.You are not going to get much benefit from only doing one or two of the workouts and nothing else.  Even doing the whole DVD may not be enough to break a sweat if you're an intermediate or advanced exerciser.  One thing that could be useful is doing a segment or two of this as a warm-up before lower body strength training, just for something different.There are a few good things about this DVD.  It's fairly fun, and you don't need a lot of room.  You don't need to be super-coordinated and, with the amount of repetition, you'll have the moves down by the end (there aren't any complicated combinations).  It won't teach you to be a dancer, but it will get you moving.  Hemalayaa is enthusiastic and seems to genuinely be enjoying herself.In the end, what you'll get out of this depends on what you're looking for.  If you just want something fun to do a couple of times a month to change up your routine, or if you want to use part of this as a warm-up for strength training, it may be worth a purchase.  If you're already a dancer or are serious about dropping some weight, you may want to look elsewhere. </p>

 <p> I really like this DVD because I'm dancing & working out all at the same time. I've been really working up a sweat with it.  Great Cardio.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to create a fun work out for themselves. </p>
