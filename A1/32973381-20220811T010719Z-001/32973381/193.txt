 <p> George Jones the Possum as he was called all his life. One of the old pioneers in the country music business, and in my eyes oneof the best.

 <p> George is quite simply the best country singer. This concert was taped a few years back but shows George in good form. Long live country music and George Jones. He came really close to not being with us but he lick his alcohol and drug problems and many people are glad he did. Thanks for all the songs you made famous. He sings for everyday people. </p>

 <p> This is it folks, a must have for a C&W fan. The Possum sings all of his big hits on this one with his voice as smoothe and crisp as ever. The sound quality is excellent except for the over dubbing of crowd applause that is more than occaisionally annoying. The only other flaw is the poor quality stage lighting makes a complete mess of the color production. The Possums Jones boys led by the ever faithfull to GJ, Ron Gaddis is tighter than ever on this one. I notice Mel Tillis' lead guitarist helping out here and a fiddle player from N.C. that is without question the finest that I have ever seen. Combined with the finest players in the land and the finest C&W ballad singer in the land, this is Country at its best. I will share many enjoyable hours with my friends enjoying this one. </p>

 <p> I was fortunate enough to see George Jones in concert and was looking forward to seeing him during his farewell concert tour until we heard the sad news of his passing.  This is a great concert DVD and reminds us of what a great show he put on and how great that voice was! </p>
