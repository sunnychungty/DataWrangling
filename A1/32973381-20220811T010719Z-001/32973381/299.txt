<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> I&#8217;ve yet to come across a wartime melodrama that I personally felt was worth its weight in gold &#8230; with the notable exception being the absolutely perfect CASABLANCA.  Mind you, there have been some terrific human dramas, but the tear-jerking story has so many mountains to climb let alone dispense with the Nazis.  Or the Russkies.  Or the Cubans.  Or whoever else Hollywood wants to throw at audiences.  Still, producers relent, believing that the perfect blend of human suffering, overwrought performances, and winning cinematography will once more woo viewers to the cause.  I&#8217;m all for filmed tragedies &#8211; what better way to keep them prescient for cultures with a 30-second attention span &#8211; but, at some point, someone should&#8217;ve fed some prenatal vitamins to TWICE BORN.  Supersized ones.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Gemma (played by the always electric Penelope Cruz) and Diego (Emile Hirsch) are star-crossed lovers who embark on their own little whirlwind romance after meeting in Sarajevo circa the 1980&#8217;s.  However, the bonds of their passion are soon put to the ultimate test: for reasons never clearly explained, Diego needs to have children while Gemma it turns out is sterile.  Still, our heroine is intent upon giving her true love a child, and together they begin to consider some dramatic choices, including adoption, artificial insemination, and even surrogacy.  War breaks out, driving them apart in more ways than the conventional soap opera writing staff could ever imagine, and it&#8217;s all rather cleverly told via flashback, with an aged Gemma introducing her son (???) Pietro to the less-than-romantic land of his &#8216;accidental birth&#8217; (???).Trust me when I say that I couldn&#8217;t even begin to recount the innumerable twists and turns required in order to make TWICE BORN into a serviceable story.  There are friendships that come and go throughout its 127 minutes, many of which are merely introduced and never given ample screen time to develop organically in front of an audience.  Instead &#8211; in an almost kind of scattershot presentation &#8211; viewers are whisked from one incident to the next with very little supporting notation to let them know that the timeframe has shifted from the past to the present.  Thank goodness someone thought to put laugh lines on Cruz&#8217;s eternally young face!Director Sergio Castellito (who also appears in a brief role, as well as producing and co-scripting the work) does what he can to continually hammer the relevance of these people, the plot, and their plight into our eyes, ears, and minds.  Sadly, there&#8217;s no real nuance to any of it.  No knowing glances here.  No heartfelt chatter there &#8230; or, at least, not in a convincing level of &#8216;heartfelt-ness.&#8217;  Instead, everything goes from good to bad then bad to worse almost mechanically.  In many ways, it&#8217;s like the big budget community theatre production of CATS &#8211; everyone knows their lines, but the substance here has lost all meaning.I&#8217;d like to think that impression was because, frankly, I could argue that the story as presented was simply too ambitious.  When I couldn&#8217;t learn to care about these people and their struggles against whatever regime or even fate that conspired against them, then it&#8217;s almost like I&#8217;m reading from recited facts of a tragic history.  It has no flavor.  It has no emotional core.  I&#8217;ve often struggled with reading historical accounts of America&#8217;s past from authors who relied so heavily on the logistics of each and every moment &#8211; here&#8217;s what caused Battle A, here&#8217;s how many men were present, here&#8217;s how many died on this day versus that day, etc.  By contrast, TWICE BORN wants me to care about Gemma, Diego, and all of the others, but they&#8217;re never presented in such a way as to make me naturally give two hoots about what they went through.Consequently, I didn&#8217;t care.  So if someone was born twice, then I cared less even the second time.TWICE BORN [2012] is produced by a whole host of participants, including Medusa Film, Alien Produzioni, Mod Producciones, Picomedia, Telecinco Cinema, and Sky Cinema to name but a few.  (If you&#8217;re interested in a complete list, then check out the citations at IMDB.com.)  DVD distribution is being handled by Entertainment One (aka E One) Entertainment.  For those needing it spelled out perfectly, this is a multiple-language motion picture (Italian, Bosnian, and English), and it is fairly evenly divided between them.  As for the technical specifications, this is a sharply assembled film, boasting some terrific cinematography along with the sights and sounds.  Lastly, if it&#8217;s special features you want, then there are a series of cast interviews along with the theatrical trailer.  (Somehow, I expected more from something I was led to believe was so important.)(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED.  Based on a novel and feeling much like I&#8217;d sat for as long as it&#8217;d take me to read one, TWICE BORN tries so very hard to be relevant, but, in the end, the melodrama feels reduced to glorified &#8216;chick lit&#8217; set against the backdrop of a modern war.  Cruz performs admirably, though not at any Oscar-worthy level (so far as I&#8217;m concerned), yet everyone else kinda/sorta blend in precisely as the local color they&#8217;re meant to portray.  At 127 minutes, it&#8217;s filled with bloat &#8211; the kind of which practically cries out repeatedly to the audience, &#8220;Look how important all of this is!&#8221;  The trouble is that it ain&#8217;t.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Entertainment One (aka E One) Entertainment provided me with an advance DVD copy of TWICE BORN by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> Margaret Mazzantini&#8217;s very popular novel &#8216;Venuto Al Mundo&#8217; (English translation &#8216;brought into the world&#8217;) has been transformed into a screenplay by the author assisted by the director (her husband) Sergio Castellitto, the film in English is now called TWICE BORN. It is complex story, beautifully sculpted with interlocking flashbacks that cover a 30 year period, photographed with great skill by Gianfilippo Corticelli, and a cast that makes this carefully integrated story of varying timeframes work splendidly. Much of the film&#8217;s beauty is in the complexity of the manner in which the story develops and revealing too much of that story would spoil the experience for new viewers. Very basically the story relates a mother who brings her teenage son to Sarajevo, where his father died in the Bosnian conflict years ago. But more needs to be added.Italian professor Gemma (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) visits Sarajevo with her son, Pietro (Pietro Castellitto, son of the writer and director). The two of them had escaped the city sixteen years ago while the boy&#8217;s father, photographer Diego (Emile Hirsch) remained behind and later died during the Bosnian War. As she tries to repair her relationship with Pietro, Gemma is forced by revelations to face loss, the cost of war and the redemptive power of love. She re-acquaints with her dear friend Gojco (Adnan Haskovic) and together they relive the horrifying experiences of the war in Sarajevo, Gemma&#8217;s attempt to provide her beloved Diego with a son (she is sterile), the eventual plan to have Diego use musician gypsy-type Aska (Saadet Aksoy) as a surrogate for the couples much desired child, and the consequences that plan takes on, leading to a series of identity crises that the now older Gemma must face with her teenaged son Pietro. The story is structured on alternate scenes from the trip taken in present in Bosnia by Gemma and her son and flashbacks from the two time periods (of the first encounter and the war), a technique that at times is difficult to follow but that definitely enhances the tension of the story.The cast is extraordinary: Penelope Cruz is dazzling, Emile Hirsch gives his most sensitive performance of his career, and Adnan Haskovic, Saadet Aksoy and Luca da Filippo (as Gemma&#8217;s father) are outstanding. This is a difficult film in message but a profoundly moving drama. Highly Recommended. In English, Italian, and Bosnian. Grady Harp, December 13 </p>

 <p> I read the synopsis, but honestly, none of the official plot summaries do this movie justice.  I was on the fence about even watching it, but 30 minutes in, I couldn't stop watching it.  I do agree that the directing did create more of a melodrama than was necessary in this riveting story, but overall I loved it.  The acting was marvelous from all players.  Frankly, and to be a little shallow, I'd have preferred someone better-looking than the director's son to have played Pietro, but he played the part well.Be forewarned, this move is not for everyone.  I would definitely put it in the chick-flick category... it is a love story set against the backdrop of war in the former Yugoslavia.  It truly does bring the war to you in the perspective of the atrocities that were committed in &#34;modern times&#34;.  A time most of us can remember.  However, the point of the movie isn't about the war but rather different kinds of love and relationships.  It is slow in parts but catastrophically moving, even when it's slow.  I can liken this movie to a French tragedy and I definitely loved it in the same way.  It does not have a particularly happy ending, but rather offers closure for the characters involved.The only negative that I have to offer is that in trying to maintain the mystery of certain events, it was difficult to figure out what was happening at times -- or rather what caused certain events.If you like Dr Zhivago, Anna Karenina, The Count of Monte Cristo, and that genre, I think you will definitely enjoy this movie... Now I'm off to read the book! </p>

 <p> Artistic, at times confusing, melodrama with wartime background. Hard to hang on to plot line until more clarity is given in the last 30 minutes; yet, the story became meaningful in the end. More abstract than direct storytelling. Viewers must piece the plot together as the director bounces around varied scenes and images, music, and moments with dialogue between characters that doesn't always make sense. Overall, not bad but not great -- ultimately redeemed by twist in the storyline. </p>

 <p> I loved this movie. I'm a big Penelope Cruz fan, but this movie kept me thinking a couple days after I watched it. Thats how I can tell if a movie was good. If I am still thinking about it days after I had watched it, it was a good flick. I plan on watching it again. Wonderful lovestory of how far you would go to protect someone you loved and stay honorable to yourself. Some thought this movie was drawn out but you needed to see the details of the sceens to fully understasnd what is going on. They actually did shorten this film some but if they would have shortened it anymore it would have ruined it. No one would have understood it. I loved it. </p>

 <p> Boring.  Terrible acting.  Poor script.  Switches from English to foreign language in same scene w/o reason.  Plot drags and could easily have been less than two hours.  Pair is laughable together and Cruz is a terrible actress. </p>

 <p> In &#8220;Twice Born&#8221; (&#8220;Venuto al mondo&#8221;), an Italian-Spanish production, Pen&eacute;lope Cruz plays Gemma, a single mother living in Rome with a military officer Giuliano (Sergio Castellitto, who also directs). One day she receives a call from Gojco (Adnan Haskovic), one of her old friends in Sarajevo. Together with her sixteen-year-old son Pietro (Pietro Castellitto, real-world son of Sergio Castellitto), Gemma flies to the capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where she lived as a college student more than twenty years ago.Based on a book by Margaret Mazzantini (wife of Sergio Castellitto), &#8220;Twice Born&#8221; goes back and forth between the present and the past, following two storylines both involving Gemma, who falls in love with a young American photographer Diego (Emile Hirsch) just before the war begins.&#8220;Twice Born&#8221; tries to mix melodramatic romance with tragedy of war, but the idea of a love story set against the backdrop of war-torn land simply does not work here, partly because what happened there is too vivid in our memories and shocking to be treated in this way. Beside the fact that the romance between Gemma and Diego lacks chemistry, &#8220;Twice Born&#8221; suffers from the uneven pace and some not-so-good performances from the cast.The film is obviously well-intentioned, and benefits from the on-location photography that is not only authentic but often beautifully done, but &#8220;Twice Born&#8221; succeeds neither as a romance nor as a war drama. </p>
