 <p> Has the length if you need it, and worked perfectly on my Samsung ATIV 9 plus...I will update this post is anything changes, but this is a great buy! Nice blue led that is on the power inverter, matching the laptop and all my other electronics. The packaging is also top-notch! </p>

 <p> Great product all the way around </p>

 <p> I bought this for my Samsung Ativ book 9 plus since I need two power cord. One at home and another one at office. It works just great. No complaint. </p>

 <p> This power adaptor was so much cheaper than the original Samsung charger, but it works just as good.  I have tried another cheap power adaptor from ebay in the past, but it did not last too long.  However, this one was perfect, and the price was good too. </p>

 <p> Great power adaptor at great price </p>

 <p> I bought another variety of adapter, only to find that the plug fell out of the socket all too easily.  Miffed, I purchased this one, instead, and have been completely satisfied with it.  It charges well, fits perfectly, and does exactly what it should. </p>

 <p> Works perfectly, and the plug fits snugly and securely into my Ultrabook </p>

 <p> Unlike another Samsung-compatible power adapter I've tried, this one seems more solidly built. I like the blue LED (telling me that power is flowing, just like the standard Samsung adapter), and the right-angle pin keeps things flush against the computer. I have not found it to be loose at all.The long cord and overall size make this an unlikely travel adapter, so I simply use the default NP900 power adapter for travel and leave this one home. </p>

 <p> Nice long cord makes it good for at-home use </p>

 <p> I have a Samsung Series 9 laptop and wanted a couple of more chargers around the house and at work.They work and cost a lot less than the Samsung OEM charger. That's what you want to know, right? </p>

 <p> Inexpensive and works </p>

 <p> This cord is sturdy and I can tell will not fray at the adapter and cord connection like my OEM adapter did from Samsung.  The cord is a great length allowing me to get much further from the wall plug that the OEM.  I recommend this replacement adapter for your Samsung laptop. </p>

 <p> Great Replacement Cord for my Laptop! </p>

 <p> I was traveling and forgot my power cord for my Samsung Series 9 Ultrabook. I bought this power cord using Prime and it arrived super fast. It works great and was a fraction on the cost of the non OEM power cords. </p>

 <p> I picked up this to use a second adapter at home. I have a small, light computer and having to lug an adapter between work and home was a bit self defeating. I picked up this adapter and it works great. It charges well and has not given me any problems. I do notice that I have to pay attention when I plug it into my computer. If I am lazy and rush I sometimes will not get the plug in all the way. What I notice is that the adapter still powers the computer but it is not in a charging state. Overall I am very happy with this adapter and would buy it again if needed. </p>

 <p> A Great second adapter </p>

 <p> Bought this on a whim for my Samsung Series 9 notebook (NP900X3D-A01US) even though it wasn't specifically listed as supported. It works like a charm, though!The power brick is actually smaller than it appears in the pictures, quite small but not &#34;flat&#34; like some. The cord is a nice length, a little longer than the Samsung one that came with the machine. I also like that the end that plugs into the computer isn't a 90-degree elbow plug like the OEM Samsung adapter.Overall, works great! </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Super slim, lengthy cord for a compact adapter </p>

 <p> It's so good, I like it very much, it's far better than the original one in my opinion.And there is a blue light on the brick. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> a very good replacement </p>
