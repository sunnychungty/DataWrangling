 <p> In your title you say "Opteka Battery Pack Grip / Vertical Shutter Release for Nikon D40x, D40, D60, D3000 & D5000 Digital SLR with 2 extended EN-EL9 Batteries (2400mAh Total)" but then in the description you say "Compatible with Canon EOS 20D, 30D, 40D, & 50D Digital SLR Camera only." Which camera is this for? </p>

 <p> This thing is awesome!!! Though it is not quite a perfectly flush fit for my D3000, it looks VERY NICE!! Makes my D3000 look all beefed up.As far as usefulness, the pack works very well. Boosts my battery life to an insane level. With my kit battery, the two that came with this pack, and a couple packs of double a batteries (yeah, thats right, it can take double a batteries too), I do not have to worry about running out of power mid shoot.As for the complaints about the vertical shutter button needing to have remote release set, this was my fix. I set my Fn button to allow me to switch my shooting mode on the fly. So all I have to do is hold Fn and spin the selector until it hits remote. Done! Finished! Its ready to use the vertical release. (Which has come in handy already).One last note... The pack added a couple inches to the bottom of my camera, allowing me to hold the camera a bit more naturally and with a bit more surety. The added grip space along with the battery life makes this a MUST BUY!!! Even if you don't need a vertical shutter release. (Though, unlike some of the other reviews say... You may find useful as well... I know I did)All in all, this was a wise purchase that will definitely pay off.Though I cant speak for the other Nikon model owners, I can safely say (as a D3000 owner) this thing works awesome and looks pretty darn shnazzy!! </p>

 <p> I bought this for my Nikon D3000 based on a co-worker's strong recommendation.  I love this thing.  I always felt as if I'd drop my camera when shooting, but no more.  The battery pack grip gives me peace of mind as I'm running about shooting my son's baseball games and my kids' hijinks at home.  It provides a sure and comfortable grip.  As I'm new to digital photography, I'm not familiary with the vertical shutter problems other users commented on.  For now, it's nice to be able to rotate my camera for a different point of view and have something to hold on to.The battery life from the single to double batteries is a bit less than double, but with a charge I can shoot for about two weeks at about 50-80 shots a day.  Even then, I only recharge because it's been awhile.  I did run the batteries low to check longetivity and went for three weeks at 50+ shots a day before I got the low battery indicator.This was easy to install, once you realize that you open the battery compartment to 45 degrees and gently pull.  Plus you store the battery cover in the grip.  Great forethought and design.The only negative thing is the fit.  The grip is slightly larger than the camera body and at times seems awkward, but it's normally not noticeable. </p>

 <p> My main reason for this was to give my camera a little size and better battery life; witch it did great on. The only down side is the shutter release didn't work. It is still a great product for the price though. </p>

 <p> This puppy works great with my Nikon D40 , it fits perfectly and looks great on the D40 . Comes with 2 batteries it also has a normal battery adapter if you need to use store boughts to get by...I have a 55-200mm Lens and with the battery grip it has a nice feel and loads of battery life.The side (portrait ) button only works in conjunction with the infrared sensor , so while it does work .. its not like the main button....The grip slides in nice and matches the D40. </p>

 <p> The battery pack grip works great, no problems with that at all. But the two Opteka batteries that come with it died after a year. I charged them maybe two to three times and went to turn on my camera and there was no power. Pulled the batteries out and tried to charge them and they were so dead that the charger light wouldn't even come on. Spend a little extra on some real Nikon batteries and in the end save some money. </p>

 <p> This grip is horrible. in order for me to operate it my camera has to be in Remote mode. It does not have a prefocus button, etc. The only plus I give this is the battery life. I only charge my camera like 4 times a month </p>

 <p> Ok, everyone has spoken of the quality of the product already. I personally love it. As far as it being made out of plastic... nowdays even half of our cars are plastic pieces. So is your computer, tv, bla bla bla!I sat and looked at the battery door to figure out how to remove it without damage to the door or the camera.Here is the trick...Open the battery door only slightly and pull. It comes right off. If you try to open it all the way to remove it, you can mess it up. If you have to pull very hard, you are doing it wrong.Once the batteries are charged and the mount is attached to the camera, turn the camera on and use it. The ON / OFF on the pack does not have to be on to take pictures, it is only for the use of the vertical shutter release.To use the vertical shutter release on the pack, flip the switch on the pack to the on position. Press the + button on the lower left of the back of your camera and go to the release mode. Press ok, on in your choices you now have 2 new one to choose from. The i symbol is for the vertical shutter release to work. The one that has a 2 beside it is a 2 second time delay, the other is standard shutter release speed.I hope that helped anyone struggling with these items. </p>

 <p> I put this on my d40 and it works fine. Vert button doesn't really work too well and it is annoying to have to go thru 9 steps just to shoot with the vertical button... basically you have to:1. Put camera in remote mode. (which I set up with function button on front for quicker selection)2. Turn on switch on batter pack.3. pop out remote sensor transmitter (basically this pops out the little compartment button on the front that has an inferred transmitter button that points up at the cameras infared sensor)This seems really silly to me because isn't the dang thing already attached to the camera?!?!Other than that it feels pretty solid and does what it needs to. Battery charge is good and I've shot over 1000 shots on it over about 5 days and still going.basically I bought this to make my cheap camera look like a bigger camera. I do a very limited amount of photographgy and it didn't justify buying a d4 which is what I really want. Lol. This kind of gives the d40 that &#34;big&#34; look that makes it stand out from a cheapo camera that anyone can go pick up at the local hair-care-and-tire-center. </p>

 <p> The fit of the grip is great and it looks good to it works fine but the only thing I don't like is that you can't use the vertical grip button and the horizontal grip at the same time you have to go into you camera and turn back,on the single shooting </p>

 <p> Well, the nikon d40 battery grip from opteka was a generally good buy, i was pleased with 47th street's shipping and all of that ( no complaints there )In this written review, i'll be going over some of the perks ( pros ) and some of the downsides ( cons ) of this battery grip/vertical shutter release device for the nikon d40/d40x/d60 DSLR camera. Feel free to debate them,just contact me at nathan_grammatico@hotmail.com, or nathangrammatico@yahoo.comOk, let's go over some of the Pros.1) price- 100$ isn't that " bad " to pay for a battery grip/vertical shutter release that comes with two batteries, and claims to be a professional battery grip.2) It adds a " professional" look to the camera, and your peers are going to be jealous, it makes your once little d40, look like a miniature version of the professional nikon d3 camera.3) The battery life- the two batteries and the six aa's make shooting in any condition perfect, and you can literally take thousands of shots, however the batteries it came with don't come with chargers, and abnormally take longer to charge on the regular charger the nikon d40 came with.4) The vertical shutter release ( pro. and con. )- you can shoot vertically with no delay ( although the instructions talk about there be a two second delay, you can change it to instant, which reduced the delay dramatically ). and it's very easy shooting in the vertical position.5) It fits into the nikon d40's body well.No, let's go over some of the cons.1) when shooting in the vertical position, you have to change it from single, to the special remote shooting mode, which takes time, and you can't just take a horizontal picture without changing the settings. Which is very annoying, and there's nothing you can do about it. You have to change the setting before you can shoot. Oh, and another thing, this is going to sound absolutely crazy!... today, when i was shooting in the bright sun, the vertical shutter refused to go off, which i found weird.But, when i went i went inside it went off. Is there a problem with the light in the infrared sensor? i'm not sure, but i'd say there's a good chance.that's the only con i could think of, it's a really good accessorynathan_grammatico@hotmail.comnathangrammatico@Hotmail.comcontact me, if you have any further questions :) </p>

 <p> Purchased a number of years ago for use with the D40X.The D40X is a great little DSLR with the emphasis on &#34;little.&#34;  I've had mine since probably 2006ish and it still takes great pictures.  The battery life isn't great, though, and for extended trips/long shooting, I wanted a battery pack.  This was ideal based on the additional batteries included and the low price.  One of the batteries I received was bad out of the box and was replaced within 48 hours (kudos for great customer service, BTW).  When charged, the two-battery pack lasts an incredibly long time and adds a much-needed bulk to the D40X's tiny frame.  It obviously adds considerable weight as well but the not as much as you might think.  One of the nicer features is a small slot on the inside of the grip for the battery door of the camera (which must be removed to use the grip).  An additional battery rack is included (or at least was when I purchased it) for holding 6 AA batteries.  This has also come in handy more than once when I forgot my charger.All-in-all, fit and finish were good, performance and service were great, and I would certainly buy this product from this vendor again.  If you're the owner of a D40 or D40X as well as the owner of a couple of largish hands, I strongly recommend this product. </p>

 <p> First, I wanted to buy a grip for my D5000 because I had a D200 and it was broken. I had plans to take pictures for some of my friends and families' events but I know my D5000 would not last for a day of shooting constantly. So I went on Amazon.com and saw this which was 24.99 with two batteries, so I was reading all the reviews and wanted to get it but the reviews with one stars was making me have second thoughts. However, it was 24.99 and I really want to get one for the D5000 so I could take more pictures for some upcoming events.Got the package two days later, and it was nicely packaged with a lot of packing peanuts. On the grip's box, it said its ideally for D40 so I was kind of panicking but the two extra batteries was a perfect fit for my camera. It is the cheaper version of the nikon batteries but I can live with that.After taking the grip out of the box, I really enjoy it because it has a good feel to it. I also has somewhat of the same texture of the body itself so it blends in. One problem I didn't really like about the grip was that its a little bit bigger than the body but you don't really notice it. But I like the feel to it. It was a quick installation and with the instruction manual, it was super easy.After installing the grip on the camera. I realize the vertical shutter button didn't really work but as I read the instruction manual, they said I need to put it on remote mode and switch two switches in the grip inorder for it to work. It did work. One other thing about the vertical button is that it doesnt really do the press it half to adjust and press it completely down to take the picture. It just takes the pictures. It is fine because hey, $25 bucks for a grip with two batteries? No complaints.Overall, I would def. recommend people to buy this grip if they want a longer life for the camera throughout and event or a series of events. </p>
