 <p> Loved it.. I love the pov of Lily and Jack.  I love how the pov is age related.  Some pov's tend to make an 18year old act 30. To me it makes the emotions real. At first I wanted Lily and derrick to work out but as Jack comes into play I root for him. </p>

 <p> I loved these characters so much, I was a bit sad when I got to the end.Sarah Daltry's Flowering series grabbed me from the beginning and didn't let go. The stories were heartfelt, steamy, and sometimes funny.She brought these amazing characters to life, they were fully fleshed out, and so incredibly well written.** I received a copy of this set, in exchange for an honest review, for Book Worms United **Everything I've written here, is my own opinion.I highly recommend this series, it is a must read, and I can't wait for Alana's story! </p>

 <p> Sarah did it yet again! This series just sucks you in and doesn't let go. At first I was a little annoyed with one of the female characters but after getting to know her I realized her personality wasn't as bad as I was perceiving it. I fell in love with Jack with each page! there are not enough words to describe the greatness that is the flowering series. </p>

 <p> This is a great series from start to finish :-)  I love the love story of both Lily and Derrick & Lily and Jack.  This continuing story has been written with such care to the very tender emotions of people. You cannot help but fall in love with the leading man Jack as he navigates through both his feelings about himself and Lily. I cannot wait for the series to continue to see what happens with the story of Jack and Lily :-) </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> This series is AMAZING! Hot & Sexy! The perfect series! </p>

 <p> Her Brother&#8217;s Best Friend:I loved this short erotic story! I truly enjoyed the fact that these Lily was in love with Derek since 8th Grade and fantasizes about him...only to find out that he feels the same way about her! This story is sexy and leaves you wanting more! The sex scene was perfect, tantalizing...and wanting some of Derek!I really love that this opened everyone's eyes to the past of Lily and Derek, there are so many times that when I am reading I want to know about the moment leading up to something and this short erotic does just that!If you have not read this ~ Go and read it NOW! You will not be disappointed and make sure you pick up a copy of Forget Me Not because Her Brother's Best Friend will lead you right into FMN!Did I say I LOVED IT! Awesome job Sarah!Forget Me Not:I knew the minute that I read Her Brother&#8217;s Best Friend that I would fall in love with this story&#8230;and I was right I LOVED IT!The first thing is, I loved that we had some insight into Lily and Derek&#8217;s relationship (Her Brother&#8217;s Best Friend), this allowed the readers to see how their relationship started. In Forget Me Not we follow Lily through her first few months of college, her teetering relationship with Derek and finally we meet her new &#8220;friend&#8221; Jack (eeeekkk)!~This novel for me showed a lot of emotions through a young relationship (which are always emotional), the mistakes that are made and the dealing with a breakup, new romance and lots of HOT, STEAMY, ROUGH SEX!!! Even though Lily was a little childish at times, who isn&#8217;t at 19? There was mistakes made on both Lily and Derek&#8217;s end&#8230;however they are young and there was a reason Lily met Jack ~ who I LOVE!So to wrap it up~ Derek is sexy in a first boyfriend/love kind of way and Jack is a sexy as hell, tattooed, badboy that wants to turn Lily into his &#8220;princess&#8221; and Lily is stuck in between!If you have not read Forget Me Not, you need to hurry Lily of the Valley is out in just a couple of weeks!I can't wait for Lily of the Valley!And lastly I want to say TEAM JACK!Lily of the Valley:Have you ever just LOVED a character in a book, not just because they are sweet, rich, and handsome, along with all the other fantasy characteristics that we all love in our &#8216;Book Men&#8217;&#8230;but what about the characters that are REAL, they have real problems, real emotions, real life tendencies&#8230;these are my favorite kinds of characters and that is why I love Jack!Lily of the Valley shows us the side of Jack that we did not get to see in Forget Me Not. We get to hear his point of view, how he feels about Lily and what is really going on in his life when Lily is not present. I fell in love with Jack even more in Lily of the Valley. Jack is a broken young man that thinks he is worthless and is incapable of being loved, so he thinks. However through Lily of the Valley we can see that Jack is so much more than a dark, bad-ass bass player; he is sweet gentle kind soul that wants to be loved as much as he wants to give into loving someone.What I truly enjoyed about both Jack and Lily&#8217;s stories is that the characters are real, they are struggling with real life issues that many people all over the world can relate too, such as depression, anxiety, happiness, sadness, anger, confusion, etc. I think that this story will touch a lot of lives and for those who have already read this story understand what I mean, most of us can relate to Jack in one form or another.Okay and lets not forget the fact that the sex scenes are HOT & STEAMY! If I have not said this so many times in the past ~ READ THIS NOVEL, I promise it will not disappoint!Star of Bethlehem:This is a must read! The perfect holiday novella for Jack and Lily!So it is no secret that I absolutely love Jack and Lily! Star of Bethlehem is a holiday novella that takes place during New Year&#8217;s Eve and into the New Year! Poor Jack is terrified about meeting Lily&#8217;s parents and has gone to great lengths to make sure they will like him, such as buying an awful itchy sweater. Lily is impatiently waiting for him to show and just as nervous about Jack meeting her parents, not because she cares about what her parents think, but because she knows it means the world to Jack that they approve of him.Throughout the evening they seem to go through every barrier possible and everything is going perfect, until Derek shows up and makes a scene in front of the whole family. I felt so bad for Jack, I wanted to reach through the pages and punch Derek right in the face for treating both Jack and Lily like trash. Jack controls himself and does not take his anger out on Derek&#8217;s face but rather punches the wood stove (which he doesn't even remember doing).Lily on the other hand is struggling with herself as an individual. She knows who she wants to be, but her family make is very difficult to by treating her like she is a dress up doll that is supposed to act a certain way and be a certain person. Even with all of the tension Lily manages to keep her cool and tells her father and mother that Jack is the most important person to her and that she has never been so happy and felt more like the person she is meant to be.In the end they spend a wonderful evening together and enjoy bringing in the New Year together, alone and away from the huge family that Lily has stalking around her house.I thought that this was a perfect way to show the readers that no matter the obstacles that Jack and Lily have to face now or in the future they can overcome everything as long as they are together!Congratulations to Sarah for doing it again! I am a devoted fan and will always read no matter what you write, because I know that you will not disappoint me! </p>

 <p> I have read the entire Flowering Series.  The story plot deepens as you read into each of the characters point of view.  This series has everything you need: love, laughter, passion, romance, heart break, sadness, and joy.  Jack and Lily's story is not an easy road, but together they learn to love one another and accept each other. You will not be disappointed when purchasing this series.When you read the series: email me back when you get to the snowman scene.  &#60;3 </p>
