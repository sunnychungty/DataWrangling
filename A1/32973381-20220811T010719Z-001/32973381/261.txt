<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Richard Gere and Claire Danes star in this dark and disturbing drama about sex offenders and the Government employees who monitor them.Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):1. Gere's character Erroll Babbage takes his job very seriously2. A little TOO seriously if you ask anybody, including his superiors3. Before they show him the door, they show him Allison Lowry (Danes) and give him a couple of weeks to train her in the job.4. Her instructions are slightly different5. A girl goes missing6. Babbage takes it personally7. Disjointed and improbable plot follows, filled with disgusting degeneracy, the glaringly obvious and the highly unlikely.Even winning performances by Gere and Danes can't save this unworkable storyline, which takes them into the depths of depravity in the search for a missing girl. Good supporting performances are seen from KaDee Strickland, Russell Sams and Avril Lavigne.Allison: What do you think about?Baggage: I think about a girl who's dead because I didn't look in a closet.Amanda Richards, March 7, 2009 </p>

 <p> GOOD thing is, this is a 2007 show, so chances are, not many'll buy the DVDThe blurb's interesting enough but for me, it was a simple story made complicatedYeah, I know, real-life is like thatGot lost halfway through or maybe I just lost interest and was waiting for it to endLike that Richard Gere's character carries a gun, although he's not supposed toLike that his character is considered an odd-ball but he gets things doneFor me, it was a bit like watching a Woody Allen movie - seating through lots of rambling for a few moments of brillianceNot much brilliance in this show, some ok bitsThis is one of those shows, I think, that you have to fully concentrate onI'm bad at such, that's why I didn't get it and that's why it scores lowIf you're the sort who can sit through 1 hour 45 minutes, maybe this is for youBut if you're the sort who tries to do other things while watching a movie, this ain't for you </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> What the Flock? </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Although THE FLOCK has some pretty good acting by veteran Richard Gere, and some okay shots that might harken some back to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS days, the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that really leads nowhere.The film is about Erroll Babbage (Gere) who works for the department of safety and is preparing to retire. His office thrusts upon him his replacement, Allison Lowry (Claire Danes,Stardust), who quickly discovers that Babbage is obsessed with his job. And that job ain't very fun. He monitors hundreds of sexual offenders who are on parole in his jurisdiction. Allison goes with Erroll on many calls to check up on his "flock" of offenders and learns that he is in desperate need of retirement. But Erroll is good at his job even if his methods aren't. He taunts sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them. Erroll justifies his actions by bringing up these deviants' pasts. It is this "good justification" that challenges the audience on some level, letting us see how brutal Erroll is and yet how out-of-touch he's become (by being too close to his job).When a teenage girl goes missing in Erroll's "area", he immediate leaps to the conclusion that she was abducted by one of his flock. But how could he know? Is Erroll that good at his job? Allison challenges him and Erroll pushes back. Their battles become as fierce as Erroll's need to find this missing girl.Although the set-up for the story was okay, it didn't have any umpf! I will give credit to Richard Gere, however, who plays the Erroll character very well. Battling retirement. Worried about everyone who's near his flock. Disgusted with those he's responsible for overseeing. Disgusted with himself for having to do some of things he does. Quite a change in character portrayal for Gere. But beyond him there's not much else. Some of the sets are okay (dark and dangerous) but there are so many other problems as to be laughable.I'll be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement whenever watching films. But that suspension has limits. The biggest push against those limits is the destruction of EXTREMELY vital crime scenes. Someone as meticulous as Erroll would KNOW that moving a body would be a huge no-no. Or trampling through a crime scene. Or moving evidence. It went beyond and hurt the film to no end.The other damaging part of this film is that we never get into Clair Danes' character, Allison. She's almost dropped by the wayside at the end of the film and we're never privy to what her intension might be: Will she stay or leave? Will she end up like Erroll if she does stay?This isn't a horrible film as it does touch on some uncomfortable moral ground, but the story as a whole needed to be tightened up.P.S. The fact that this movie went straight to DVD and didn't get air time at cinemas in the U.S. is pretty telling. As is the fact that only three other reviews are up here at Amazon.com at the time of my posting. </p>

 <p> Good movie thanks to the subject and Richard Gere - he really shines.  Claire Danes is very low-key, which perhaps what the director meant for her to be, but the result is she projects no personality to speak of and thus forgetable.I just had to write this review, for the sake of stating that I could not DISAGREE more with amazon editorial review.  That review claims there's sexual tension between Gere and Danes.  If there's, I completely missed it.  I was actually expecting for something sexual to develop between the two, but nope - the bond could not come off more asexual.  Another mindboggling editorial statement is that the movie "condemns sexual deviance while depicting it in absurdly lurid and titillating ways (the scenes in a porn studio/fetish market are slathered with moral indignation but ooze with repressed lust)".  What???  If I were that editor I would keep these revelations to myself.  Certainly did not find anything in the movie titillating - just utterly disturbing and nauseating.In general, I found this movie great in a documentary/education sense.  It's good to be aware of what kind of people lurk out there and what they are capable of. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This is one of Richard Gere's strongest performances - thanks to taut direction from Andrew Lau.  Gere melds himself convincingly into the role of a man haunted by his past, the onerous aspects of his job, and the sexual offenders that he polices - aka his "flock".  His character Errol Babbage finds himself in a very dark place - far darker than where Gere has gone before, as I recall him in roles like Internal Affairs.  This film reminds me of "Seven" with Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, but is more disturbing in many ways.  Intense viewing and probably not for the faint of heart or those who expecting a comfortable feel good film or Richard Gere as eye candy...Claire Dane delivers a consistent performance as the protege stepping into uncomfortable shoes.  They could've dialed it up even higher and avoided a Hollywood ending, but it's pretty gritty as it is.  I give Gere's performance 4.5 stars. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Richard Gere plays the lead character, Erroll Babbage, an employee of the department of public safety, whom takes his duties a little too seriously.Erroll Babbage doesn't know how to do anything else, but his work at the department of public safety as he has made it his entire way of life. His methods for dealing with sexual offenders is very unorthodox, if not altogether controversial, and illegal according to department standards. Erroll Babbage is so out there that he has alienated himself from his co-workers and supervisors that he has been forced into early retirement.Claire Danes plays the role of Allison Lowry. Ms. Lowry is the new kid on the block hired by the department of public safety to take over Erroll Babbage's position. Erroll Babbage has one month to train Allison Lowry to do his job of which he seems reluctant to do.... In fact, he harasses Ms. Lowry and invades her privacy and even goes as far as placing her life at risk.When a teenage girl goes missing, Babbage feels that it is one of the offenders he oversees and so he sets out on finding the person who has kidnapped the teenager. "The Flock"  becomes a chilling, gruesome suspense thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat as to what the outcome will be as well as to who is the kidnapper!! One also begins to question whether Errol Babbage has lost his marbles from being overworked or if he really has a handle on who could be committing the heinous crimes! Watch the movie to find out.Only major down fall is that Richard Gere doesn't seem the best man for the role of Errol Babbage. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> A failed Richard Gere flick about an embarassingly unstable vigilante and his clueless side-kick </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Recipe for a good thriller: take an A-list Hollywood star, give him a gorgeous and gifted actress as a side-kick, make them work with sex offenders, add a serial killer, add a little part of Avril Lavigne, throw in some serious psychological and professional problems for the main character and make it all cook at high tempeature and under strong pressure of a strict deadline. With such a treat, logically one should be the next Iron Chef of Hollywood, no?Well, NO! Because somewhere, quite early in the film, Andrew Lau forgot what exactly he was trying to do - and clearly he couldn't remember it until the end...As the result we have a boring film, wasting the talents of both stars. Richard Gere's character,a civil servant making control visits of registered sexual offenders, is unpleasant,stressed, self-destructive and anti-pathic, but definitely not fascinating - in fact he is an annoying guy and watching him is frequently embarassing... His assistant and future replacement, played by Claire Danes, is a rather pale and pathetic person, hardly having anything interesting to say. The handful of sex offenders shown in the film are pretty pathetic people, which is probably how it is in the real world, but as the result they are simply boring!The dialogs are weak, there is not even one moment of humour (even dark one) and the "investigation" of the main "mystery" is so annoyingly boring, that I had to fast-forward some parts of it. And Avril Lavigne makes just one extremely short cameo - and sorry for disappointing all the hopefuls, but she is very strictly and fully clothed in it... And, let's stress it again, Claire Danes is playing a pale side-kick, saying weak lines and just following the annoying and embarassing Gere's character. Frankly, wasting the potential of not one but two such good actors should earn Andrew Lau a place amongst the registered "film offenders" of Hollywood!The only reason I give this film two stars is the character of Viola (played by KaDee Strickland), a female sex offender who seems to be a kind of Babbage's "pet project". Her appearances are the only moments when something interesting happens on the screen.Some people compared this movie to the most excellent "8mm" but please believe me, those films have NOTHING in common! "The Flock" is a failed, boring film, which made me lose one evening - do not let it happen to you... </p>

 <p> It started off a little slow and kind of confusing (for me). I wasn't exactly sure what was going on at first, but that is what is great about the movie. They throw you into it. But at the moment when they began to discover more clues concerning the disappearance of the girl I was hooked. i really enjoyed Richard Gere's character, which was hilarious at times because he was so bent on finding the killer, and he knew he was right, despite Claire Daines yelling at him. My favorite part was what he did in the car after he had snuck into her house. I won't say too much so as not to spoil it for people who haven't seen it yet. I also liked that Avril Lavigne did a cameo for the film. The theme was dark, but the storyline and characters were good. I liked it, plain and simple. </p>

 <p> Richard Geer and Claire Danes were perfect together in the roles as the experienced parole officer of sex offenders Richard Geer and the newbie, who is take over Geer's job.  She learns that the job is a lot tougher than she expected and sees why Richard Geer is the way he is with these people, who Lie through their eye teeth every chance they get.  They show the sick world of the sexual parolees and what the parole officer has to never trust a one of them, as they are not going to change one bit, as this is a person who is no longer a human being, but a very mentally sick individual, who does not give a damn about human life............. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Sporting a cool name and a hot temper Richard Gere stars as Det. Errol Babbage, a man watching over his Flock of registered sex offenders. Errol's methods are  too harsh for his superiors so they give him one  month before they let him go. Babbage is a loner obsessed with his work, so when one of his sickos doesn't provide the right answers he thinks nothing of slapping him around or beating another with a baseball bat. When a young girl gets kidnapped and held hostage Errol loses it and  makes it his mission to bring her back before he shuffles off. Hoping to keep him in check his boss, (the great Ray Wise) assigns Errol a partner named Alison Lowry (Claire Danes). Babbage doesn't appreciate this so he breaks in his new partner by taking her to a sex dungeon where he rubs her face in how dirty and dangerous their job is. As more clues fall in to place Errol believes that one of his Flock whom he has tangled with before is behind this latest kidnapping. It's a genuine shame that more people aren't going to see this film since it was released Direct to Video. The directing by 'Infernal Affairs' Andrew Lau is solid and the performances he gets out of his cast are excellent. This is one of Gere's riskiest and best performances ever. Danes isn't bad it's just that her own work is overshadowed by Gere's powerhouse performance. The subject matter is  disturbing and graphic which can make this a tough film to watch at times. Hopefully this little seen masterpiece will find an audience on DVD or cable. </p>

 <p> I watched "Flock" with surprise, as I hadn't even seen promo's for it. I LOVED IT!!! I don't need to tell you whats in the movie, everyone else has already done that. I was amazed by the movie. Richard Gere, can play ANYTHING and make it come out good. I believe he did better in this, than he did in "Internal Affairs" and I believe that's saying a lot. While the movie is some what slow at first, it has to be. It has to get the people watching it, into what's going on. I feel that's hard to do, with the subject at hand.  Sexual predators is a very hard subject to do in a movie. It's a touchy subject. Anyone in "real life", who works with these people gets a feeling about them. I doubt that many of them act on it. That's what I love about this movie. I felt myself WANTING to do just what Gere's character did. I can't wait to get the movie for myself. I own ALL of Richard Gere's movies and I haven't be disappointed in any of them. I feel Gere should get an award for this movie, as it IS an out-of-cast character for him, and he plays it so well. I really don't understand the bad reviews that this movie got. I guess that some people expect too much. I just love to watch a movie just for what it is. Now I'm not saying, I haven't seen what I thought was a crappy movie. What "I" think is a bad movie. verses other people would probably start an argument.  I guess one persons bad movie is another persons good movie. Isn't it great we all don't like the same things??? </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> The Wolf in the Fold </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> There are almost as many things to really like in this movie as much as there are things to be repulsed by and to dislike.The best thing it has going for it is a terrific performance from Richard Gere.  One of my guilty pleasures is THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES, not because it's a great movie but I'm from that area and knew about the Mothman--and a really good performance from Richard Gere (for an off-the-wall supernatural movie that never quite gels, he gives a sincere depiction of grief and obsession that transcends the material).In THE FLOCK, he's the burned-out monitor to his "flock," his workload of sex offenders he has to keep tabs on.  He's done it for so long that he feels he can even sense when they're going to go "off the reservation" and commit more sex crimes.  And if he thinks that, he doesn't mind stomping them into the dirt.  Obviously, a very tightly-wound character who may or may not be someone to admire.But that's the thing about this movie: I think a lot of people will be conflicted at one point or another.Would anyone have a problem with Gere's character physically assaulting sex offenders for the entire movie?  Is he a monster for abusing his power for keeping them "in line"?  Are any of them truly rehabilitated?  One genuinely evil character will leave wondering after the climax.  This is a movie that gives you a glimpse into deviant sex...and leaves you to wonder if it turns you on.I like all of these elements to a good sexual thriller.But there were things that I wasn't so crazy about.  I had a hard time believing that Claire Danes could take over his job.  There were too many times that she appeared as a damsel in distress, especially in this line of work!  The thriller structure was a little obvious toward the end but I'm not sure what else they could do with it.All in all, THE FLOCK is worth seeing if you like movies like THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and SEVEN (successful) or 8MM (not-so-successful).  Dark, thoughtful, interesting.  Something that makes you look inside your own little tastes and kinks, if you have any.Do you? </p>
