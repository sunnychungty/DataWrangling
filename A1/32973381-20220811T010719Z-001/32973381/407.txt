 <p> A decent book. There were several interesting tidbits in here, but some parts were kind of repetitive or seemed to drag on and on. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Interesting and fun! </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Actually, I was expecting a rather dry history of traditions, and was very pleasantly surprised!  Ed has a conversational style that's fun to read, and inserts unexpected treasures -- like a recipe for pancakes in the chapter on Shrove Tuesday.  I think readers of all ages will enjoy this book. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Whether your church tradition includes or excludes Lent, this slim volume's facts and explanations are so neatly and clearly pulled together they should surely fascinate. From the background of 40 days to the reason for Easter eggs, from the name of a pagan goddess to the history of Passover, from the surprising derivation of the word Carnival to recipes for Dutch pancakes, there's something for everyone.Can you apply thermodynamics to religious festivals? Do you know any good pretzel stories (with monks, of course)? And why did Jesus ride a donkey (or a mule)? Author E. G. Lewis answers these puzzles and more with gently informative writing and fascinating research, questioning everything--even the choice of Sunday for Easter Day.Relaying history and science with equal enthusiasm, the author brings a familiar story and all its background to life, adding depth to characters, revealing reason behind action, unraveling politics, and finding the (often surprising) facts behind legends and modern-day denials of ancient relics. Never demanding that readers agree with his conclusions, E. G. Lewis has created a book that both encourages thought and inspires a search for answers. Beautifully illustrated, helpfully organized, and written in a pleasingly accessible manner, this is the perfect book to accompany Lent, or to share with friends when the subject of Easter comes up, whatever your background.Disclosure: I was lucky enough to be given a copy, which I promptly read and enjoyed. </p>
