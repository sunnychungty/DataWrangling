<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Firstly id like to thank Colee Firman for giving me this book in exchange for an honest review.HELL YES!!!!!!! I must say that even though my expectation for this book was set pretty high which I dont normally do but just couldnt help, since ive LOVED the last 2 books and have become a massive fan of the series. Colee did not disappoint though and infact she sprinted past any expectation I set.I absolutely loved the prologue from little Tanners point of view and to see what he thought when he first saw her.We were left with a dramatic ending in sanctify with Tanner blocking their connection and sending Addy to Greystone alone. Now if i just spoiled the ending of Sanctify for you to bad cause you shouldn't be reading this review if you havent read the first to books (Dissever and Sanctify). So hop to it people, you will regret it if you dont go and grab a copy right now.Sorry got abit sidetracked there for a moment, where was I? ah yes...Throughout the first half of this book we follow Addy come to terms with Tanner's decisions and reasons for leaving her. This book is the most emotional of the 3 so far and we see Addy struggling to find who she can trust as new friendships are made and old ones are tested as well as centuries old enemies of Eva and Andrew's come to light and have their sights set of Addy and her power. Oh and the ending! i admit I may have shed a few tears.There was alot of twists in this book that i loved and didnt see coming, however i did find it unhealthy the way Addy continually reflected different sybols daily to cope with her fears and emotions. There was also Gage's unhealthy obsession with Addy i know it is explained why things happen and perhaps im biased as i have been team Tanner from day 1 but Gage just needs to realise that they not only are destined but chose to be with each other.Addy and Tanners relationship as well as Addy herslef grew alot in this book and i was glad to see by the end that she wasn't afraid to make the hard decisions that she would have onces shyed away from such as:"Akori who chose to go with Oric were no longer their concern- that she had to focus on protecting the ones who were left. That was her goal - protecting those who were willing to give their lives to protect hers"."She knew things came with a price. The cost of getting what she wanted-the price for her happiness was too high".I dont know how i am possibly going to last until december when book 4 Twisted Memories is released because that prologue and preview into book 4 at the the end of this,, has made me want it even more then i did. Alas i will just have to wait i guess even if i slowly die until i get my hands on it.Colee if possible save me from my agony and release it earlier - if possible pretty please :D </p>

 <p> My heart is broken.For me, for Addy...for all the characters.This book is much darker and more serious than the previous two books, as the big, super-evil but undeniably smart bad guy is revealed. In fact, saying the villain is 'revealed' is deceiving because this book basically covers the entire story-arch: history, followers, how followers are gained; basically all the W's and then some. So, in addition to everything that was already happening in the previous books, this one continues those storylines and adds this one. I didn't realize how complicated this book was until almost half-way through! That said, even though there's lots going on, things are pretty easy to follow (even if you have to dig around in your memory a bit to remember who's who and who did what however many years ago). AND I absolutely love that this author doesn't go for the big cliff-hangers, yet leaves the end of the book open. Her books are so good, you just WANT to keep going to find out what happens to the characters, not just because you're left in a lurch.I have to say this book really got under my skin - more so than the other books. Probably because, as the third book, you really get to know Addy. Plus, I think almost everyone out there has felt the pain of heartbreak, so I definitely related to that. I started this book late at night and finally had to go to sleep. But of course, I couldn't because I was just imagining what it'd be like to be Addy - to make the decisions she had to, to feel the loneliness and confusion she was experiencing...yeah it took awhile to play through all those scenarios and get to sleep (I blame you Colee Firman!).Anyhow, without giving anything away, this book covers a lot of ground in a lot of different story lines: Addy and just about every character (Tanner, Jax, Gage, Mr. Evil, etc, etc), Brutal Ball, Tournament of Lost Souls, the villain...just about everything mentioned in both previous books, and probably some things I'm forgetting about. One thing that really struck me was the motives behind the villain. It was unusual and really chilling (and very Joker-esque...aka creepy).As with the previous books, the pacing feels right (matches the story). The story itself...do I like everything that happened? Nope. Not at all! But I'm not the author. I'm putting my faith in her; she's built such an awesome world and such dynamic character that I'm just going to have to follow her lead.At the end of this book, there's a preview chapter for #4. I couldn't stop myself from reading it even though I know it will be slowly burning away at the back of my mind, so I'm starting a count down until December 1st! </p>

 <p> I got this book from the author, free of cost, in exchange of an honest review from my side.Firstly I would like to thank Colee Firman, author of Chasing Darkness, for giving me this wonderful opportunity of reading and reviewing this fabulous book of hers.Wow! This book is a whirlwind and it sucked me in from the very first. Here we are drawn back into Addy's life and we get to see that Tanner betrayed her and sent her back to Greystone alone while he stayed at Tremain himself. Now Greystone is threatened by an unusual death count in which the victims get burned from inside out, creepy right? Now Addy has to find out the secret behind this before it's too late and she loses the ones she heart. We also get to witness the brewing romantic interest in Addy's heart for Gage and she tries to solve the puzzle of her feelings. Will she be quick enough to grab Gage's heart before someone else claims it? Oh and not to mention The Tournament of Lost Souls have already begun and the most evil villain is unleashed, beware!!!I really loved this book and I think that it's the best in this series, well till now as I don't know about the sequel to it. I laughed and cried with this book and the emotions were perfectly portrayed through the skilled words of the author and they touched my heart totally. There is lots of action in this book and the dark side just got darker in here which was a treat to me. The brewing romance was so passionate yet cute and the pangs of betrayal that Addy faced, wrenched my heart as well. The secret regarding the weird deaths really kept me hooked to the story and there were so many unpredictable twists and turns that I couldn't predict even one scene. All in all a superb read and I'll recommend it to all YA lovers, you're going to have a feast with this, so go on and grab your copy!!! </p>

 <p> I received this book for free for an honest reviewThis book starts off a few months after the last one ended. Time is spent in both Ravensbog and Greystone. Addy goes through every emotion possible and seeing her work through the good and the bad drives the story on. Then ending was a bit of a cliffhanger but not nearly as bad of one as in the second book!This book is even better than the other two. I actually felt like I was the one going through everything. I laughed, cursed, and cried. This book put me on a roller coaster and once i started it I was unable to put it down, I just had to know what was going to happen next.  I have not felt so amazing after reading a book in a long time. It took me through every emotion and left me wanting more!I recommend this series to everyone this book brings in so many components and blends everything together perfectly!Thank you so much to the Author Colee Firman for allowing me to read this wonderful series! </p>

 <p> And so the story continues and pulls me in even further!!All 3 books have been very well written and the story line has been beautifully executed. Each book leaves you wanting more....there's an urgency to devour the books to find out what's gonna happen but at the same time you don't want the story to end!Usually when reading, it's the main characters that imbed themselves in my head and heart ....but in these books I am invested in ALL the characters. The author has done a marvelous job of bringing all the characters to life in a big way and I find myself connecting with all of them on some level. Of course I have my favorites....Tanner, Tanner, Tanner....and then there's Abby who is the kind of heroine that I thoroughly enjoy reading about, strong and capable but tender and emotional also.This book brought a lot of answers and understanding to questions and events that took place in the first 2 books. I absolutely loved that these books were unpredictable...about the time you think you had something pieced together, it would take you in a different direction. The book, for me, was very easy to follow.... Just not predictable!I will say that at the end of this book my heart was broke and I hated having to come back to reality with that feeling ....sooo I will be waiting, not so patiently and with a broken heart, for the next installment!!(less) </p>

 <p> Holy emotional roller coaster ride! I found myself crying harder then I have ever cried during a book. I loved it but am praying that things go back to &#34;normal&#34; it just doesn't feel right. I won't say what doesn't feel right, but if you read the previous books and loved them as much as I did, you will feel the same way too. This book just adds more to each character and makes you wish the series never ends. Seriously there is nothing worse then the last book in a series!! I am so glad that I gave in and decided to read an Ebook for the first time, this was definitely worth the headaches I get from using electronics for too long haha.You find yourself crying your eyes out because of how much love you have for the characters.  The author does an amazing job at character development, you feel what they feel and see what they see.  This story will have you at the edge of your seat praying that everything goes the way you want it to, because honestly you don't want anything bad to happen between Addy and Tanner again.  UGH!!!!  So sad!!!  ='( If you loved all of the other books, you will absolutely love this one. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Chasing Darkness is book three in the Unbinding Fate series. The story picks up a few months after Addy is sent back to Greystone without Tanner. Strange deaths plague the Akori of Greystone, a deadly tournament is kicked off, and an unknown evil threatens all that Addy holds most dear.This book focuses on the series' love triangle in great detail. Tanner is left behind in Tremain (Earth), and Gage comes back with a vengeance now that he's out of the picture. Addy's mixed feelings are prominently featured. She's attracted to Gage, but cautious of him. She misses Tanner, but is angry at him. The resolution of these relationships caught me by surprise.The evil only hinted at in the previous books becomes a real and tangible danger in this one. The struggle that emerges with it is emotionally charged, particularly due to the betrayals, hidden loyalties, and losses suffered. These things also make this book a rather complex addition to the story line. There is so much going on, it is overwhelming at times.The story wraps up with some issues resolved, but many others are worsened. The degree of tragedy is staggering, and if there weren't another book out there with some hope of a happy ending, I would have been greatly disappointed.Overall, I really liked the story, but the degree of tragedy was shocking. People who enjoyed the first two in the series will likely want to read this one, too, but be prepared for escalating trouble in Addy's world.This story should not be read as a standalone. I recommend starting with Dissever and working your way up to this one. </p>

 <p> I laughed, I cried, I gasped, and I groaned.  Most of all, I felt.  With this novel Firman brings emotions to the forefront and does a brilliant job of passing them on to the reader.  Through her unique brand of vivid writing and show-not-tell mentality Firman takes the readers that she has immersed in this world with the first 2 novels of the series, and draws them in in an irrevocable way.The brilliant world that Firman has developed for this series continues to grow in this segment.  Everything remains the same yet changes drastically.  Firman's fluid writing and impeccable storytelling smooth the transition making it all seem natural.  She describes everything in such detail that you feel like you've walked through this world with the characters.Firman has a fluid writing style that almost mimics how people think and feel.  This, combined with her amazingly well developed characters leads to an intricate cast of individuals that you come to know and love.  Firman works amazingly deceptive characters into her world to create chaos and mayhem, while balancing them with characters of amazing compassion.  All the while, none of her characters are completely over the top, even if they are larger than life at times.  Each and every character is individually developed in such a manner that they could stand on their own, yet they never overshadow the main characters.The events that began in the first 2 novels of the series come to a head in this instalment, only to create the need for more time in this world.  As a reader, you find yourself so invested in the lives of the characters that you cannot, nay will not, extricate yourself from them.  At the end of this novel you are left with a sense of conclusion to one dilemma, yet fully needing more as you cannot leave the characters behind, especially with their latest fiasco at hand.Please note that I received this novel free of charge from the author in exchange for an honest review. </p>

 <p> Colee Firman has skillfully crafted yet another great story in her Unbinding Fate series.  From the first chapter in Chasing Darkness, I was drawn back into her marvelous characters, her fantastic worlds and breathtaking suspense.  I love how Ms. Firman can mix a little romance, fantasy, mystery, suspense, and a few really evil characters into a story that just keeps racing ahead.  I can count on her characters to keep me guessing, and caring, from the beginning of the book to the very end of the last chapter.  This third book does not disappoint in any fashion.  I especially love the strong female character that doesn't come across as silly or sappy, but smart and adaptive - great way to portray a young woman! Stay strong Addy! About the time I think I know where the author is taking me in the story, she twists it and I'm heading in a new, even more wonderful direction - so starting each new book in this series has been exciting. By the end of the story, I was completely engrossed and did not want to crawl out of the story back into the real world.  Each time I've finished these books, I cannot wait for the next to be written, and that is more than true with this one.  This is definitely one to recommend. </p>

 <p> Wow, where do I start?I love this book. Best in the series so far for me.There are so many surprise turns in this book it is the complete opposite of predictable. I didn't put it down... I couldn't.The characters have all been developed beautifully across the first books. The storyline is intricate yet easy to follow... FOLLOW - not PREDICT!I don't want to include spoilers but I have to say that this book also broke my heart... which was just mean.Book 4 is due in December 2013 and I don't know how I'll stand the torture... I need to know what happens to these characters.I soooo recommend this series. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Before I begin with How much I love the series I just have to say that I am not a big fan of the new cover design. It is lacking the intrigue and mystery that the original covers exude. Cover change aside, the content remains excellent, drawing you back in from the very beginning. Addy is developing into a strong character.She expands her relationships and takes charge of the situation at hand. The villian is all the things a villian should be and makes you hate him and root for the &#34;team&#34; Love ,love love these books CAN NOT put them down,they are just fantastic and amazing, and unfortunatly sad at points.  After reading Dissever (book 1) I quickly purchased and read Sanctify (book 2), Chasing Darkness (book 3) and Twisted Memories (book 4). I couldn't put my Kindle down until I read them all. I'm looking forward to Hellfire (book 5) slated for fall of 2014. (Can not believe I have to wait that long!!) </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Stellar Installment in the Series </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> WARNING - THIRD BOOK IN A SERIES, INHERENT SPOILERS CONTAINED IN THIS REVIEW -- READ ON AT YOUR OWN RISK...Having devoured 'Dissever' and 'Sanctify' back-to-back in one sitting I was beyond anxious for the third and final book to come out. At least I thought it was to be the final book, and that I would get to the heart of the remaining secrets and mysteries, not the least being the final state of Addy & Tanner's relationship, if there would even be one at all.Chasing Darkness opens in Greystone, with Addy working to maintain her anger at Tanner for severing their connection & sending her back to Greystone alone. All without any warning her or getting her consent. Addy spends her first few months back in Greystone essentially in hiding, both to deal with her heartbreak concerning Tanner and his actions, and to avoid having to answer the inevitable questions surrounding her return sans-Shepherd.As Addy slowly begins to re-enter her new world she finds herself developing new friendships, and strengthening old ones, with Akori in Greystone and in Ravensbog. In a effort to help maintain the facade that all is fine in the Palace, and with the Shepherd and Shepherdess, Addy begins studying the meanings of all kinds of Akori symbols. One of the tricks she learns is Reflecting, tracing the specific symbol on her mirror in her own blood, thus allowing her to Reflect back the intent of that symbol, be it pride, tranquility, serenity, decisiveness, etc.As she slowly readjusts to life in Greystone without Tanner Addy has many decisions to make. Decisions that will impact not only her but all Akori. One of those that impacts Addy far more than the Akori as a whole is the status of her relationship with Gage. The longer she is in Greystone the more often she encounters Gage. With each encounter Gage pushes his suit to win her back, insisting he refuses to make the same mistake twice and let her go again. One of his planned excursions with her is to explore the ruins of the original city using a map he found in his father's library. Reluctant at first Addy gives in to her sense of adventure and finds herself exploring the surprisingly beautiful city. She also finds that she is drawn to the ruins and to Gage.As hard as Addy tries to hold on to her anger at Tanner so she can keep the pain at bay, she just can't seem to do it. All she wants is to have Tanner back, as she loves him with every fiber of her being. So then why is it that she says "No" to Gage with her words, but her body says something else entirely?This book was so well written, the characters jump off the page, each having gained more depth and complexity than in the previous books. Newly introduced characters are also more well rounded and add a great deal to the story line, though what it is that they add isn't always clear at first, nor are their reasons for the things they do and choices the make. With the introduction of a new antagonist things get very interesting very quickly. Alliances form and reform in the blink of an eye, with no one knowing who can be trusted or who might be working against them. Virtually everyone could be a spy in their midst. All of this serves to keep the pressure on Addy, even as she tries to sort through her feelings for Tanner and Gage.Along with the new antagonist comes more creative world building, not just from the visual, but from the societal stand-point as well. Things range from slightly foreign to totally foreign, and yet other things seem to be the same, particularly gender-based biases. Ms. Firman did an excellent job of giving her characters more depth, allowing them to grow and learn, while still allowing plenty of room for more growth. She didn't stint on the personal imperfections, often those character flaws that make them so relatable.For all that I was sooooooo looking forward to some serious resolutions, I find that I have reached a fever pitch of anticipation for the next book in the series. I may spontaneously combust from sheer excitement as the December 1st release date draws ever closer!! (Unless of course I enter an alternate universe where I am lucky enough to succeed in begging an ARC from the talented author, with promises of a speedy and honest review that I shall do my best to get posted everywhere in advance of the public release!)[Note to self - ask the laptop fairy for a replacement machine to allow me to begin my own BookBlog soon, money to afford having the Internet at home. . . + what the hey, while I'm at it, a way to get more hours out of each day to allow for work, tons of time to read, write reviews, interview authors, and comment on other bloggers, authors, & readers reviews, etc. Its not as if I'm asking for much (grin).] </p>
