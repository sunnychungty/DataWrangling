<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> I loved this show sooooo much - but to too expensive! </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> James Alfred Wight aka Herriot was born in my old home town in Northern England (Sunderland (and in the same street as my mother)) of English parentage. He moved to Glasgow, Scotland where he grew up and studied to become a veterinary surgeon.Once qualified he moved to Thirsk (named Darrowby in the stories) in North Yorkshire where he stayed for the rest of his life.I watched this show on TV when I lived in England after reading the books and loved every single episode.I would love to own this set but at over $300 it is more than I would pay for a series in it's entirety. I just bought another series from Amazon with more disks that was only 50 dollars.I guess in my house nostalgia is great - but only at the right price. If you don't mind the price, you will enjoy the series IMMENSELY. For me, I will keep it on my wish list until it gets to under one hundred dollars.My five stars are for the show itself. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy these stories or not, but I decided to give them a try.  I was concerned that they would all be "tear jerkers," capitalizing on the viewer's love of animals by dealing with sick and dying animals in a maudlin manner.  While to some extent this is true, it was more of a natural mix of real stories.  Based as it is on the semi-autobiographical novels of James Herriot, a veterinarian who practiced in Northern England during the early part of the 20th century, the stories are a delightful concatenation of animal stories and the lives of some of the eccentric people in the area--my favorites being Mrs. Pumphry and her pekinese Tricky Woo.  (At one point after James tells the wealthy lady that the dog must get more exercise, she has her gardiner carry the dog around the garden three times a day).  The interactions among the central characters, the brothers Siegfried and Tristan Farnan, the "new" vet James and his wife Helen Harriot, and the marvelous housekeeper Mrs. Hall are wonderfully balanced.  The acting is exceptional, creating a sense of real people, people one would like to know.  There are disagreements, as there are in any family, pranks and jokes, and a loving support in hard times. (When a dog owner takes his own life after his pet must be put down, James feels responsible for the man's death and is supported by his wife and friends, subsequently able to rise to the occasion when another pet owner threatens suicide in a similar incident).  In the background is the rising threat of WWII; knowning as the viewer does that the charming world of these people will be irrevocably altered once the storm breaks, makes each episode a treasure to be remembered, and one can empathize with Siegfried when he sits on a hillside trying to remember every nuance of the landscape as it is before it is lost forever.  By the end of the series, when the two senior vets go off to take part in the war, the viewer feels all the emotional tugs of seeing close friends leave without any assurance that they will ever return again, and sharing a clear knowledge that even if and when they do, things will never be quite the same again.  I think in part that intensity comes from our own experience with the world as it passes from the "once upon a time" into the vague and distant future. </p>

 <p> We received the All Creatures Great & Small-The Complete Collection and am so thrilled the quality-- (and, of course, the stories)! Speed of delivery great as always as well...just love Amazon!But, because, just under the image of the dvd set under "Better Together" section it said "buy this dvd with All Creatures Great & Small-the Specials" we made the mistake of assuming the specials were NOT included in the set.  We know with the Little House on the Prairie dvd's we had to purchase specials seprately.The complete collection with this All Creatures set means just that! So when the specials we ordered as "better together" arrive we will need to return it.  I did read about the set but never read about the specials being part of the set.  The "better together" section threw me off, I guess.We highly recommend this series for anyone.  It is a great series to view again & again!  We would give it 10 stars, if we could!  Enjoy </p>

 <p> My husband and I are working our way through the complete set of All Creatures.  I had read the books and still treasure them, but my husband was not familiar with the James Herriot stories.  Alf Wight, the veterinarian who wrote the books, revealed his love and respect for the Yorkshire farmers over and over, as well as his love of animals.  He had a unique way of telling stories of the farmers, animals, and his family, including Sigfried and Tristan.  How well I remember the times James would linger on his way back to Skeldale House, stopping to take in the magnificent English countryside, the rolling hills and the stone walls.  Just when and how did all of those walls get made?  Some of the stories are hilarious, some are heartwarming, and some are quite sad.  To me that is a satisfying mix. </p>

 <p> All Creatures Great and Small: The Complete CollectionYears ago, when this series was on TV, I didn't watch it because I didn't think that the film would be faithful to the actual books.  After viewing most of these DVDs (I'm almost finished), I find that they are absolutely delightful!  I only wish they had captioned them since the Yorkshire accent is a little hard to understand for these "born and bred" American ears!While some of the stories were adapted for the film version, they're not bad adaptations.  The scenery is true to life and the acting is superb regardless all the way through--especially Chris Timothy, Robert Hardy and Peter Davison.  These fine actors truly captured their characters as described in the books.I highly recommend this series without reservation. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Demonstrates why quality needs no laugh track </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> On a snowy Sunday morning in a Bosnian living room I was watching an old episode of the police drama "Monk." One of the main characters is Leland Stottlemeyer, a gruff police captain who is also Monk's patron and one-time boss. In this episode, Stottlemeyer is attending an "anger management" class under departmental orders because he slugged another cop who teased him about sleeping with his wife.During the class, a patient goads him with "at least I know where my wife is." Stottlemeyer gets up and starts across the circle of chairs. The annoying "facilitator" steps in front of him and condescendingly says, "Leland, remember your affirmation. Say it." Pause. "OK. These things happen." Facilitator: "I have a gift for you, to use when this happens again." She gives him a yo-yo. "I don't think so." "I can refuse to sign your release and you'll be with us for six more weeks." Stottlemeyer ponders. "OK." He takes the yo-yo, slowly sits down, and starts flipping it violently. "Leland, you don't have to do that." "Yes I do."Well, you had to be there, but the scene had me doubled over laughing. After the show ended, I started to ponder why this was so funny. Largely credit actor Ted Levine, who played the scene straight. Then I realized there was another vital element: NO LAUGH TRACK. It was funny because Stottlemeyer stayed so perfectly in character as the hard-boiled "seen-it-all" cop. A laugh track would have turned him into a clown, and destoyed the comedy.I started trying to think of other comedic shows the were blessed with an absence of canned laughter.Came to mind "All Creatures Great and Small," the 1970s-80s BBC series about veterinarian James Herriott's adventures in the Yorkshire dales. Marvelously played by a superb British ensemble, it is one of that 5% of shows that cross the threshhold from "acted" to "apparent reality"--where the characters are so real that you lose consciousness of watching a performance. The genre is "human interest character study," but it is also comedy. The pompous but good-hearted Siegfried Farnon, the jaunty wastrel younger brother Tristan, and the solid diligent but often hapless James Herriott make for many a laugh--some mirthful, some convulsive. Again, it is funny because the characters are real. Canned laughter would have killed it--would have made this classic just another trifle of a diversion.Not a single laugh-track comedy--not one--qualifies for that 5%.One of the saddest examples of the destruction wrought by laugh tracks is another BBC series, "As Time Goes By." Jeffrey Palmer and Judi Dench play a couple in their late 50s who had a passionate affair during the Korean War, then lost touch for decades. Chance reacquaintance re-ignites their now-mellow passion. These two strong and fully-developed adults then have to contend with each others' foibles. Good premise.It is exhausting to watch. The writing and acting are so good that you momentarily cross that "apparent reality" threshhold. Then that damned laugh track comes blasting in and snaps you back to recognition that you are being merely "entertained." So you work hard to re-gain the illusion, but soon again it is quashed. Painful. The British should know better.A middle case is the American series "How I Met Your Mother." It follows five late-20-something New Yorkers through one theme after another, setting up just about every kind of dilemma, distress, and encounter that life raises. It is one of the more imaginative and well-written shows going and the characters are realistic, if a little overdrawn. It has a laugh track, but much modulated. As a result, you can half-maintain the "apparent reality" illusion. But you also half lose it.I speculate that some kind of negotiation took place between the creative people and the suits. "We need the laugh track to let the idiot audience know what's funny" the suits might have said. "But it degrades our writing and our characters," the creative people said. So they compromised.I do not believe that the majority of TV watchers are idiots. But I do believe that there are two kinds of viewers: those who really watch intently, and those who are only half there. Laugh tracks serve the second kind, and unfortunately they are probably the majority.It might also be that some shows are so bad, so unfunny, that they would never succeed without amphetamine-level laugh tracks. "Two and a Half Men" is a prominent example.That doesn't answer why the GOOD shows have this nonsense. Let us plead with producers to become more discriminating. </p>

In its world live people of every description: the humble, the meek, the noble, the preposterous, the grumpy, the proud and the vile. All Creatures Great and Small draws a picture of the human race that gives us reason to hope: Perhaps, even with all our faults and failures, we really do have the decency, kindness, good humor and courage needed to survive. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Seasons 4-7 were very hard to work through. I'm guessing that the main reason for most people who weren't exactly keen on the show after Season 3 was the recasting of Carol Drinkwater with Lynda Bellingham. Terrible decision on the part of the show's producer. Lynda has none of the warmth that Carol brought to the role of Helen, and also has a complete and utter lack of any chemistry whatsoever with Christopher Timothy. Rumors have abounded over the years regarding Carol's reasons for deciding to leave the show, but I'll decide to stick with believing she left because Helen had been taken as far as she could go as a character and she wanted to pursue other projects. But boy did the casting department royally screw this one up.But the biggest reasons I just could not get into the show after it returned to the air were both the fact that we saw less and less of Peter Davison, and, even MORE troubling, the almost the complete lack of any real character growth for Tristan. He was still being written as comic relief for the most part...a complete buffoon who is still grossly irresponsible and incapable most of the time, and still treated like an annoying insect by his overbearing older brother (especially when he tries to stand up for himself, something even James would laugh at him over). If anything it almost seems as if Tristan devolved, showing only a few short (and quickly forgotten by Siegfried) bursts of brilliance, ingenuity, compassion and imagination. Plus, as Peter himself mentioned on one of the episode commentaries, he found it somewhat embarrassing to be pushing 40 by the end of the show, and still chasing around girls in their 20's, if that! And I have to agree with him on that point, sometimes it was painful to watch.As I said, the first 3 seasons were excellent, a grand mixture of witty comedy, deadly serious drama (especially in the 3rd season, with WWII growing ever closer), and a good deal of educational material. I found myself going on the net and looking up a lot of the diseases the various animals suffered from, to get a better understanding of just *how* bad a case we, the audience, were looking at through the eyes of the vets, farmers, and pet owners. And although it was good to see a number of familiar faces returning (what would the show be without Mrs. Pumphrey and Tricki Woo?) I felt that, with a few shining exceptions, there was really not much to get excited about, and the show became formulaic to the point of asking why they even bothered to bring it back. </p>

Filled with all kinds of English characters, the series is a delightful peek at England and the English, before WWII.This classic series cannot be beaten for true value.

 <p> I have owned the complete series for a year now and my wife and I have a standing Sunday evening date with Mr. Herriot  and the folk of Darrowby. If you are a fan of the series, there's no reason for me to gush about the characters and story lines, which are delightful. The picture quality of the DVDs is mediocre at best; obviously made from an inferior source, or perhaps simply what was available at the time. My only real complaint is the lack of subtitles. The audio is weak and when you add the accents, comprehension is somewhat difficult (ours anyway). You have to really crank the volume, so that's why 4 stars instead of 5. Every episode is included---the specials as well. The packaging is large; each season in its own standard DVD case, but seeing as there are so many complaints when DVDs are packaged in cardboard sleeves, this should satisfy those people. There are inserts in each season with short synopses of every episode. It's an expensive package, yes, and that will turn some people off. It is however great family entertainment and if you are willing to make the financial investment, you will be rewarded with many, many hours of enjoyment. Recommended. </p>

 <p> I use to watch this seires with my family when I was young. Finding the whole seires on DVD and in a box set was so cool. Yes it is a bit expensive but I tell you if you buy it, it won't disapoint. The picture has been enhanced some what from the original, the volume is a little low at times but you have to remember this was done in England with low quality film. Some might think following the story of vets around isn't exciting but that's not true. They are very interesting, entertaining, and even funny shows that the whole family will love.

It will bring much joy in the future.The first three seasons included in this set are exactly as I remembered, having watched them fanatically on my local PBS channel so long ago.  The last four seasons are all new to me, as I had never seen them aired on my local television station.  The same is true of the "specials" that are included with the set.I got the entire collection for a quite reasonable price from an Amazon affiliate vendor.Thanks for making it available. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> The first three seasons were based directly on the Herriot books.  After that, the next four were written up from scratch.  There is in fact a difference between the first three and the last four, filmed 10 years apart.  Not only are some actors different, but new characters are added.  Also, the tone changes just a bit, with a more incidental music.  Personally, I didn't care for the additional incidental music as I thought part of the charm of the original episodes were the silent moments.  Silence is rare nowadays and we forget how to appreciate it.I do think there is a slight drop off in the quality from the original to the newer episodes, but it is maybe a half notch drop.  Still fabulous.No sex.  No violence.  No cursing.  Fabulous for all ages.  One of the most enjoyable and comforting programs ever to appear on television. If you are having a bad day, watch one of these before bed and settle yourself down, knowing all is right with the world. </p>

 <p> This purchase for the DVD's of this series was to replace the old VHS tapes we had.  We are again watching a favorite series about life as a vet in Yorkshire, England.  Well written and produced.  Not many computer generated graphics or explosions.  Just down home, on site filming to give you a real feel for the land and the people of pre-WWII England (and after).  Main characters actually have relationships - funny, flawed and caring. </p>

 <p> One of the best BBC serials of all time. Why would anyone not like this series. I certainly love to re-view this special program. </p>
