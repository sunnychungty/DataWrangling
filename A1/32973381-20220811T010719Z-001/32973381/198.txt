<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Wonderful feel-good movie, a gentle story about the magic of hope. Great for the entire family. </p>

 <p> Anthony Edwards is wonderful in this gentle, humorous story set at the turn of the century. Angelica Houston is also divine in this as his love interest, a young woman of privilege, spirit, and unique perception. This inspirational movie is great for the entire family. </p>

 <p> Based on Thornton Wilder's novel THEOPHILUS NORTH, this is, in its own quiet way, a magical picture. It's about a young college man who gives off electrical charges from his body (an old parlor trick); he comes to Newport one season early in the 20th century and begins to transform people. There is an exuberance and optimism that rub off on these stuffy summer people, and they begin to come to life in a way they've never experienced before. And, of course, there are those electrical charges, which some residents swear to as having magical healing powers. As reality, this movie would never work, but it has a fairy tale quality about it that transcends believability and allows us to just enjoy the proceedings. Definitely worth a watch. </p>

 <p> Remastery falls short of original release. </p>

 <p> As with other magnetic media, I was so looking forward to getting rid of my old VHS cassette of Mr. North, and so I bought this movie in DVD format.  Fortunately, I kept the original release, having had negative experiences in the past with re-releases (masquerading as remastery.  HINT!  Remastery is nothing more than a "BS" code word for modern technological vandalizm.  Some idiot decides to tinker, tweak, carve up, butcher, mangle, and thoroughly destroy an original work of art by superimposing their spin on a story. They chop up someone elses work and make a kindergarten collage of the pieces and then pawn it off as a "Remastery."  What a crock!  Fortunately, Mr. North suffers this indignity in only a few minor ways.  The opening credits have been reworked, replacing the opening scenes of Mr. North's bicycle trek around Rhode Island with some hoaky billboard style credits.  The opening music still plays, but there are no visuals.  And, somewhere along the way, 3 minutes have been added to the overall length of the original film, but I haven't quite figured out where that was done yet.  This is just one example of the many negative reviews I have submitted regarding remastery at its very worst. Many artists, (musicians, film producers, directors, etc.) in all forms of media have had their works destroyed in this fashion.  Buddy Holly's original master recordings have mostly been overdubbed, and the film "The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea"  was chopped all to hell shortly before its release on VHS back in the 80's.  It's akin to drawing a mustache on the original Mona Lisa in the Louvre museum, or busting the head off of Michaelangelo's David. I recommend you buy an older VHS copy of this film and transfer it to DVD yourself. </p>

 <p> So glad we could find it here on DVD. It is packed with stars and gentle humor. It prompted us to read the book it is based upon, and we like the movie better in this case.It is not mainstream, but is treasured at our house! </p>

 <p> For the most part, this is a cute movie.  However, if you kids old enough to catch certain actions and language [mine are 10 & 12] - this isn't for them. There are a couple of scenes and lines that caught us off guard! </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> A Timeless Film - Ignored by many and under rated </p>

 <p> A delightful film!  Anthony Edwards is supported by a tremendous cast of characters including Robert Mitchum, Mary Stuart Masterson, Anjelica Huston, Lauren Bacall, Harry Dean Stanton, and Virgina Madsen.  Based on a novel by Thornton Wilder and directed by Danny Huston, the film, filmed on location in Newport, Rhode Island, captures the charm and innocence of the 1920s.  Anthony Edwards carries this film and makes the film, which would otherwise be simply mediocre, come to life.  A charming film well worth watching. </p>

 <p> This is one of those little films that never got traction with the public, but which gain cult followings for decades. Others have summarized the plot. I will just say that the wonderful actors, stars and characters, were perfectly cast in their roles. The plot has a childlike quality to it, which adds to its charm. This is a movie about goodness. and, as we all would like to believe, goodness wins out in the end. It isn't a Princess Bride, but it's the same kind of film. This is a movie to go back to after spending too much time watching the news or reading about the economy. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Part fantasy, part history, Mr. North takes a look at the 1920s among the Rhode Island elite. Mr. North is a Yale graduate who invades their world  with his ability to shock people, both literally, practically,  and philosophically. At first his very powerful static electricity is just a wonder for kids but when adults learn of its benefits he is treated like a healer of diseases.A well rounded cast including screen legends Robert Mitchum and Lauren Bacall lend grace and wit to the implausible tale of an upstart righting wrongs and humbling snobs. It is based on Thornton Wilder's last novel, Theophilus North. </p>

 <p> i guess another bunch of 'excellent' to 'the best movie i've ever seen!' reviews by crew and director/producer to get folks to purchase this dvd. not the worst i've seen and so wants to b a 'classic' but it was just slow as in 'snail's pace' and even the old time legends acting was stiff and forced. and then 'spoiler alert' leave now 'spoiler alert'! ----and to have 'Mr North to end up with Anjelica Houston who even with hair pulled back and tons of make up still looked like she was his mother! def not someone North would 'fall in love' with. i mean he went from Virginia Madsen to Anjelica? yea right! so wanted to like this movie but after a few days of just being able to only watch 30 mins at a time as i had to fight to stay awake this dvd will b going up in the used 'for sale' for a penny! i hope i get that! </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> A Harmless &amp; Fun &quot;Feel-Good&quot; film... </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Just got the DVD, and forgot how wonderfully entertaining this film really is. Danny Huston's directorial debut was met with mixed reaction, but this film never fails to entertain. It's simple, sweet and a bit profound (based on Thornton Wilder) and the attention to 1920's period detail is intact. The most fun thing is the exemplary ensemble cast that Mr. Huston assembled (no doubt with help from father, John, who was co-writer). Anjelica Huston, Mary Stuart Masterson, Tammy Grimes, Virginia Madsen, Harry Dean Stanton, the wonderful Lauren Bacall, and, most notably, the GREAT Robert Mitchum. Holding it all together,in a wonderfully confident fashion, is a young Anthony Edwards in the title role. He is an Everyman, knowing he is better than his lot, talented and confident enough to fulfill his dream. A fine cameo from the great playwright, Christopher Durang, is also a pleasure. After a day of beating your brains out and wondering why life isn't better, watch this film and you'll feel good. Apparently, Mr. North was in all the right places at the right time... Hey! It COULD happen...(?) </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> A Bit of a Disappointment </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I liked this movie, but after reading the book it seemed a bit of a disappointment.  I guess that is the price you pay for trying to squeeze a lot of book into just 2 hours of movie.  Still, I liked the movie in it's own right.  I liked the actors and I liked the light way it was treated.  The book (Theophilus North by Thornton Wilder) was written late in the life of the author and was more like a series of stories about the same place and time (Newport, Rhode Island in the 20's).  It was probably written from the journals and notes of the author and so had characters who were more fleshed out and stories of the same nature.  This movie adapted from the book was in need of a mini-series to properly do it justice.  It was the last project for John Houston who was replaced in the movie by Robert Mitchum because of his death.  I recommend the movie and more importantly the book, both of which I bought through Amazon. </p>
