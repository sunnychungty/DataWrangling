 <p> I wanted to enjoy this as recently I am spending many hours a day watching documentaries. However that being said wanting to enjoy it is completely different than what this movie was able to deliver. It would seem this movie was made by Pro-British and Pro Loyalist directors. Within the first 10 minutes there were so many Slanders toward America I had to turn it off.It was so bad I was wondering if Kim Jung Il had commissioned the movie to be made to try and lower national patriotism. </p>

 <p> The main problem I have with this documentary is the following:I believe the History Channel should be ashamed of themselves for portraying George Washington as an ambitious, calculating and even incompetent man.  Where much documentation exists of people testifying to Washington's humility and general desire to be a Virginian farmer as opposed to a politician, they dismiss this... even insinuate that his "pretended" sense of duty was some great plan for military and political ambition.  They mentioned nothing of his connection to "Providence"... how he prayed regularly- and was seen so doing- nor how he insisted that his men prayed also.  They've taken a humble, great man and tried to turn him into something completely different.  If you'd like a true picture of this wonderful, God-inspired man, please read the following book:The Real George Washington (American Classic Series).Secondly, the discs have a tendency to freeze; so they are not of the highest quality. </p>

 <p> Who ever said watching TV isn't good for you?If you watch this series, you'll learn so much about our brave American founding fathers and what Independence Day is really about. You'll know why George Washington was the first president of these United States and have a greater sense of what that means.I'd say something like this is a must see for all Americans. </p>

 <p> Watching this presentation is better than not watching any; however it falls prey to the standard history Channel problems and maybe more so. First of all it is in soundbite presentation which means one presenter makes a one-liner statement without following through with what was meant by that one line; then we gets a quick over dramatic reenactment of some sort of act without any supporting background or context. Possibly due to the fact that this is a composite of several programs better than half of the presentation is repeating and repeating then repeating. If they were going to build a composite they could have cut out all the repetitive statements. If you wait long enough you will find a few unique grains of information in the entire shaft. But who wants to dig through all the shaft and repetitiveness and the superficiality defined one or two useful grains of information?Save yourself some trouble and watch the PBS's version "Liberty! The American Revolution" and read the companion book as it displays the events in a more novel form. </p>

 <p> We discovered this 13 part series by accident and are very thankful we found it! The series tells the story of the American Revolution in a manner that is thoroughly captivating, holding the viewer's attention at all times.This is an excellent video retelling of this historic time that conveys the drama and challenge that faced those brave Americans who endured the times and lived the experiences. The format is documentary and the key players who act out their parts in full costume do not actually speak lines but the narrator quotes from actual documents from the time conveying their thoughts.Although this may sound strange, it works out very well in practice and one is easily able to follow the action and thoughts of the principal players in this saga. The last two episodes provide a review of the war in the context of Washington's ride to New York for the swearing in ceremony that would make him the first president under the Constitution.There is one, possibly two strange things about this series; the most obvious is the omission of Lafayette's part in this war; the second would be the very favorable account of Benjamin Franklin's contribution to the successful outcome. Franklin may not have been the sterling character portrayed in the series and Lafayette was most decidedly an important player in the war. I know of no explanation for these two inconsistencies.Overlooking these two questions, I recommend the series for all ages and encourage families to watch it together as a significant and revealing commentary on the nature and progress of the American Revolution. This is definitely a keeper and worth repeated watchings. </p>

 <p> I've been a fan of American Revolutionary History for many years and so after joining Netflix, I ordered this documentary to see if I would like it.  I only had to watch one or two episodes before I knew I was going to love this series.  It has provided me with the clearest and most comprehensive understanding of the Revolution of anything I've studied so far, and I think the history and narrative are very honest and fair in their accuracy--not just another remake by some liberal with an underlying agenda of destroying our faith in our founding fathers and the revolutionary patriots who gave their lives to create the greatest, most free nation ever known on earth.  Not sure why one reviewer said the DVD quality was poor because my DVDs are gorgeous to watch on a 1080p hi definition TV.  I love the homes and architecture of the early American colonies.  While there is no actual talking by anyone acting in this documentary, the readers and experts who do talk are very professional and make it interesting to watch.  If you love American Revolutionary history or know someone who does, this would indeed make a great gift--for them or for yourself.  Enjoy.  I love it and very highly recommend it.  I will wear these DVDs out as I watch them over and over again! </p>

 <p> Generally informative, but terribly slanders George Washington, claiming he was overly ambitious and deceptive - pretending not to be ambitious to hide his being secretly ambitious. His well-known attempts to cultivate his own character, such as his rules of conduct, are dismissed as tools of ambition. It is an accusation born of the secular historian's insistence that all actors be motivated by selfishness, and not much else, the same hobbled mindset that still cannot comprehend that England ended the slave trade, committing economic suicide, because of Christianity.His humility is, however, evinced by his life, words and conduct, including his refusal to stay on another term as President, and these pointy-headed critics are not fit to lick his boots. And they know it, thus their repeated attempts at slander. At least, that's my theory. I could be wrong.A sad blot on this series, which is an otherwise good introduction to the Revolution. </p>

 <p> Great photography and very artistically done. The producer tries to put you near the action as if you are there in camp or on the battlefield.  The actors do a great job, and Mark Collins as George Washington is the best. He looks very much like the leader that Washington was.This video set is worth the money, and time to watch it. It brings history to life, and is very informative.  If you have trouble just reading a book on the Revolution, you should have no problem with this very visual look at the Revolution.  Great film set, beautifully photographed and filmed.  Highest Recommendation.  A+++ </p>

 <p> This box set is by far the best historical account I have come across so far.I would have loved this box set more if there were more battles of the Revolution shown and historically explained,in other words if this had 10 DVD'S instead of 5.It would have given a much more in depth understanding of what we were fighting the British for ,which were much more than Independence.by seeing and hearing from the narrator battle by battle we would understand and be amazed as to how far our will to fight the British was. </p>

 <p> I must say that I was impressed with the overall view of the video. There are some flaws to this Documentary, but they give an extensive details that can be beneficial to a newcomer to this subject.The first things that I was glad about was they mentioned the Southern portion of the War. Usually, very little of the Revolutionary War is mentioned below Virginia, if at all, and I appreciate the detail they give towards it. Also, it does give detail of Benedict Arnold's heroics before his treacherous deal with the British, and may portray a different perspective for some. Also the mention of France, prior towards Yorktown, and that they address some of the myths of the war, such as Valley Forge being the worst winter, when it was Morristown that was worse.Now the issues. The problem that I have with these documentaries that involve reanactments is that you start to see the same scenes again over a course of a video. Such as George Washington swiping papers and other material off the table, Benedict Arnold pointing giving orders during Saratoga, the same group of soldiers digging ditches and trenches over again, Same scene with Benjamin Franklin riding in a carriage in France, just to mention a few. The lack of detail of the Dawes and the other riders is also something I noticed. Or the lack of mention Marquis de Lafayette at all. How do you have over 10 hours of documentary and miss some of these details? And these are just the ones I've noticed. The overview of George Washington on his way to his inaguration was also unnecessary. They could used that to mention more about The Constitution, or some of the people that I previously mentioned, or just excluded it altogether.With that being said, it's solid overall. Not sure it's the best documentary concerning this, but it's not worth omitting for view. 3.6 out of 5 Stars. </p>

 <p> I have watched these DVD's several times and each time I sit in awe and wonder for the sacrifices made by the first Americans and the founding Fathers, especially George Washington, for the independence of our country from England.I look at the USA today, and wonder how many would be willing to give up all they did for our country.  All the lives lost in the Continental Army, the struggles, the battles lost and won, the hardships they faced, are unbelievable, as we have so much today.  Our problems today, are so few, compared to what they faced.These are beautiful DVD's and so realistic.  I just live out the scenes with the actors, as the Revolution of our country is certainly on display in the scenes of the well produced movie.I think every American needs to see these DVD's so they will have such an insight into the sacrifices that were made for the country we have today.All I say, they is awesome, fantastic!RaynaRenee </p>

 <p> Tragically, many Americans lack an understanding of the ideals and aims of the American Revolution.  This presentation by The History Channel is a superb production that succeeds in doing justice to its great theme.  Happily, the historian-commentators are much less annoying in this production than they were in "Founding Fathers" and they actually contribute to it, rather than detract. (I truly wish that there was an option in "Founding Fathers" to simply delete the annoying historian-commentators altogether.  They were condescending and simply awful.)The production does a highly creditable job of explaining the American Revolution from its beginnings as a protest against taxation by Britain to a social phenomenon that was to create a new nation.  The military campaigns that were necessary to win the Revolution for the Americans are thoroughly, and I think accurately, explained.  The re-enactments are very nicely done, and the film also does a very good job of using maps to help the viewer understand some of the military difficulties that both sides faced.  Likewise the film uses historical paintings and drawings which enhance the presentation.  The narration is simply excellent.This is an excellent and realistic presentation of the American Revolution to which the discerning viewer will repeatedly return. </p>

 <p> Despite being thirteen 50 min. or so episodes long this History channel opus falls short.  Concentrating as it seems to do on the military aspects of the war, there are surprising omissions.  Arnold is given a lot of attention, yet his entire campaign in Cannda is completely ignored!  In fact the entire 1775 Rebel Invasion of Canada which came close to succeeding is not once mentioned here.  Fortunately the fledgling United States failed to secure British North America, but to omit this entire aspect of the war seems unfortunate.  Benedict Arnold played a major part in this campaign, and there were several famous actions that should be chronicled here.Another serious omission are both the battles of Assunpink Creek (aka 2nd Battle of Trenton) and Princeton.  Trenton gets most of the credit here while neither of these actions that came a few weeks later hardly get any mention.  They formed an important part of Washy's Winter Campaign of 1776-77.The battles around New York were also glossed over with a general look at Long Island and virtually nothing else about Harlem Heights and White Plains.  Even Nathan Hale, the alleged Spy and Arsonist of New York was ignored.  This I found surprising considering how famous his speech on the gallows was.  "I regret that I only have one life to give for my country, etc, etc".The Saratoga Campaign gets brief mention as well with important details left out.  The 1777 campaign around Philadelphia shows Brandywine Creek but neglects to mention Germantown fought just a few weeks later.  It was this battle as well as the success at Saratoga that decided France's declaration for the Revolution.While all of these may be considered somewhat minor omissions they do add up.  For a series of such length they should have been included.  The last two episodes which dwell on Washy's life basically repeat material seen throughout the whole series already.  This wasted time might have been better spent providing fuller coverage of the entire conflict.There are some good episodes buried in the mass of the whole.  In particular the siege of Charleston was well done.  Others have good aspects at times.Some of the talking heads used throughout the series were light on their knowledge of the period.  There were only a few historians with published works used here.  The re-enactor footage is repeated a lot.  Some of it does not match up well.  The Bunker Hill scenes hardly matched the battle.  In some cases its almost better to use historical prints and paintings if the Living History scenes are limited.  This is a production choice of course.As with most History Channel Productions there tends to be a lot of repeat material as these are designed for commercial TV.  The same scenes and music are often re-used at various times throughout the series.  There is a tongue and cheek aspect to the narration that gets annoying at times.While the production quality is over all quite good, I was disappointed with some of the decisions made to portray the better known aspects of the War.  These have all been well covered before with earlier series.  There was a chance here to provide a really comprehensive view of the Rev War period.  Unfortunately the producers opted for the more standard approach with a few clever gimmicks. For a series of such length the History Channel's THE REVOLUTION falls short in a number of critical areas.  Its still a good, standard view of the History, but the true Rev War buff will find much that is disappointing.  Worthwhile for another general look at the History of this compelling period, but not as complete as it should have been. </p>

 <p> I have yet to encounter a "perfect" film history of the American revolution or founding. This series deserves 5-stars not because it is perfect but because is is an excellent introduction and broad overview that keeps the viewer so engaged one only wishes the series continued to cover even MORE territory!  The series tells a fact-based narrative that, tragically, students in K-12 and college are not likely to encounter at all in today's educational system. If you have kids, I would highly recommend purchasing this to watch with your children. It is both enjoyable viewing for adults and very educational. Some critical reviews here have negatively commented on omissions, but the editors clearly had to make trade-offs regarding what to include from the detail-rich, multi-year history of this period. I think they have done an excellent job.For anyone familiar with the U.S. educational system today there should be a sense of urgency to view and share such a powerful educational tool as this video series which is entertaining enough to hold one's interest for hours and hours of viewing. Historically factual narrative can provide knowledge that simply WILL NOT be taught in most schools/colleges today; it can also provide an antidote to the pathetic but widely-taught neo-marxist perspective. What do I mean by this? Sadly, one of the most widely used texts to teach American history today is Howard Zinn'sA People's History of the United States (P.S.). Academia is filled with such tenured radicals today and it is their perspective that is increasingly dominating the way entire generations of young Americans are taught to view the founding of our nation. As a Boston University history professor, Zinn was a contemporary marxist and political activist posing as a scholar. His appallingly unscholarly and egregiously dishonest agenda was to "expose" the "truth" of American history as the long march of economic, civil, sexual, political, etc. exploitation and oppression of "the masses" by the elites. Although he died last year his widely taught "history" lives on to indocdrinate students across the nation. If you doubt this, look at the nearly 900 rave reviews of his book.For this reason, I wish the History Channel series had laid greater stress on the fact that every signer of the Declaration of Independence knew their signature made them traitors to the Crown for which the penalty was a hideous death by being hung, drawn and quartered; and I wish it had explored the tremendous losses suffered by so many of those signers whose homes, estates and livelihoods were successfully targetted for destruction by the British military when they were not able to aprehend the men themselves.What are the other weaknesses of this mostly excellent series? I very much disliked the actor they chose to portray George Washington in silent visual re-enactments. In addition to being a poorly skilled actor, his posturing consisted largely of standing, marching or riding about with a never-ending supercilious expression. That constant expression of haughty disdain, and his  doughy facial features and body did not at all convey the historical George Washingon of that time: the powerful 40-something man of action, athletic horseman, and strong leader capable of inspiring great loyalty and near-universal respect among both military subordinates and political colleagues. But those qualities WERE conveyed in the narrator's text, so one can tolerate the annoying pantomime actor.Finally, do not expect the production values of a Ken Burns documentary. This made-for-TV series had budget constraints. But given that reality, the producers did a very clever job of conveying a visually rich re-telling of a historical period war that ranged across multiple states (and nations).In short, yes, one can quibble about this or that. It is not a perfect production. But it STILL merits 5-stars because it is an enjoyable, compelling, educational, superior production and a repository of critically important historical facts that are rarely taught properly in our contemporary educational system. As an Ivy League educated student of history, I thoroughly enjoyed the entire series (I've watched it twice!) and look forward to viewing it again with my children, which will be accompanied by many a dinner discussion to bring home the lessons learned. This would also be a complementary classroom tool for that minority of K-12 teachers interested in teaching the genuine, fact-based history of our American founding. Highly recommended for a wide range of viewers interested in fact-based, research-based history in an engaging format! </p>

 <p> "What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly; 'tis dearness only that gives everything its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed, if so celestial an article as FREEDOM should not be highly rated."Thomas Paine's words are as essential today as they were more than two hundred years ago and this series is well worth your time if you have any interest in the American Revolution. Ken Burns' legacy as the father of modern documentary is felt throughout the 13 hours that comprise this splendid series by the History Channel; the combination of historical commentary, dramatic recreation, and maps detailing troop movement gives the viewer a supreb overview of the period driven by the revolutionary spirit of Rousseau, Locke, and Jefferson.If there is any shortcoming to this series it is the fact that 13 hours is simply too little. I guess I'm never satisfied, but there's more to any story than meets the camera's eye... </p>
