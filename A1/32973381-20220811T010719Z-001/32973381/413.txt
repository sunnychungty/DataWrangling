 <p> Who wouldn't love a story that starts out with a rock star and a witch? Reggie is hot, but he doesn't have long to live. Then he meets Angela and suddenly he wants to live forever. The story of these two is only part of the charm of this book. Reggie, an ailing rock star suddenly has these awful dreams and finds the only cure is a dreamcatcher Angela, the unusual woman who suddenly makes him want to live, gives to him for protection. Add in a pesky contact with Ajax, the devil's advocate who captured Reggie when he was young and you have a very usual story. I really loved all the characters in this book, and that is unusual for me. The story moves along at a good pace and at times my heart was in my mouth at some of the things Angela and Reggie along with the rest of their crew encounter. There's a little bit of a love story as well as a new idea of family. There's also a couple of twists along the way that I didn't see coming. The author manages to combine the modern with the supernatural in an almost seamless way. I highly recommend it for a fun read.flag </p>

 <p> This is a fantastic modern day good versus evil love story with witches, lawyers, rock stars, Knights of the Templar, and the devil himself.This book is very well written and is surprisingly humorous.  I enjoyed how Bruce Jenvey switched the voice of the book between almost all of the characters.  I think this helped to make it a more well rounded and realistic storyline (or as realistic as this type of story can be).(*I received a copy for review purposes.  However, all opinions are strictly my own.) </p>

 <p> I received Angelas Coven to review last month but have been so backlogged I just got to it this week. Boy was a glad I made time for it though. After reading a slew of Vamp and Were novels I was ready for a nice change of pace.I found the first chapter or two a little slow, but once I was three or four in the storyline really picked up. I enjoyed the way Bruce Jenvey switched POV from character to character keeping us up to date with each of the separate forces as they slowly came together. Also being a fan of the theory that Jesus was married I liked the way he incorporated the "Holy Grail" into the novel.As for the characters, Reggie is someone who grows on you. At first he seemed like a self centered rockstar. After all who else would sell their soul for fame? But as the story progresses you see he is really a pretty noble guy. He sold his soul so they could all be famous, still not a very good reason but at least its a better one.Angela is a strong female lead character. Having suffered her own great loss in the past she is willing to risk her own immortality to help save someone else. She also takes great risk by bringing Reggie home to meet her family/coven putting them all at great risk.My favorite character was actually the Devil him self. I love the whole business man feel Bruce Jenvey created around him. Him bragging about the shagg carpet was just too funny. It was a nice twist to the master of all things evil.Overall I really enjoyed this book. The end, although sad, gave you a nice warm feeling. Everyone puts their differences aside for the greater good. If only more people could do that everyday! </p>

 <p> This book has a nice fast pace to it. Jenvey did a good job on developing the story and the main characters, Reggie and Angela. His introduction and development of the other characters of the novel is also very good. I really like it that he weaves facts in with the fiction and that his witches do not wear pointed hats. I found myself reading with anticipation of the next page.Since the title says "The Cabbottown Witch Novels", I am guessing there will be other novels and other characters coming along soon.Can't wait to read them. </p>

 <p> Angela's Coven is one of the best paranormal mysteries I've ever read. It is beautifully written, the story is gripping, characters bright and real, and the ending wonderfully surprising. Even if you are not into the occult, witches or whatever, this is a book that has many things going for it, mainly good characters, a compelling story, and fine, fine writing. I look forward to any future work done by Bruce Jenvey. </p>

 <p> I love a great good versus evil love story and this is definitely one of them.Jenvey has managed to make a great story combining quite a few great aspects to make this story truly interesting. Witches, demons, Knights of the Templar, a rock star, curses, contracts, mystery. You name it, this one just might have it.This was a very well written story that was pretty fast paced and never left you hanging. It has a lot of twists and turns that I didn't see coming and some truly great characters.It was a very entertaining and fun read. There was some great humor that helped break up some of the more serious matters and I liked that about it, that no matter what, the author still managed to make this a lighthearted read.I have heard that this is part of a series and I think it will truly be fun to see where the author goes with it next. Who will be in it and what it will be about this time around.I would love to see some old faces again and as well as some new ones.I am giving this one 3.5-4 Stars.Very well done!! </p>

 <p> Characters:Reggie Sinclair - An aging, terminally ill rock star who sold his soul to the devil in his youth in exchange for a successful career.Angela Bradbury - A witch and shop owner in NYCAjax - Attorney for Lucifer, holds the contract on ReggieLucifer - The devil himselfMaddy - Angela's aunt, head of the covenKatelyn, Shannon and Melanie - Younger witches who round out the coven, each with a special abilityWhen I got this book to review, I thought, oh great, a witch book. However, once I started reading it, I thought, this witch book is great!I really enjoyed Angela's Coven from start to finish. The characters are interesting, the dialogue realistic, charming and funny, and the plot is fast-paced. From the beginning, I like Reggie and Angela; I liked their chemistry together. Their banter and joking back and forth seemed very real and not forced. As both have loved and lost, I was hoping they'd hook up. It's no secret throughout the book that Reggie is dying, and his soul must be saved, so there's a real sense of urgency for Angela and her coven to help him. As they are going up against the attorney for the devil himself, don't expect everyone to come away unhurt. Overall, this is a very likable story, even if you're like me and don't think you'd like a witch book - give this one a try.(Review provided by Kathy, a Literary R&R; book review blog team member) </p>

 <p> Angela's Coven by Bruce Jenvey is a good vs evil love story that is also humerous at times and had me laughing out loud.  The story follows Reggie Saintclair, a famous rockstar trying to save his soul.  Reggie meets a witch named Angela who is willing to bring him to her coven to help him.  We meet Angela's Aunt Maddy who turned out to be one of my favorite characters.  Maddy is a "old" fiesty woman who can throw jabs with the best of them.  I loved the use of modern touches, and was happy to see my favorite television show Psych mentioned in the book. The characters are all intertwined with suprises to be discovered. The author had me hooked at the first chapter and I could not put this book down. I hope this is not the last we hear from Bruce Jenvey.  A must read book.Rating: 4.5Heat rating: MildReviewed by: Rae, My Book Addiction and More </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> Angela's Coven is an interesting novel. It successfully manages to combine magic, mystery, devilry and philosophy, with humour, romance, witchery and hope! Reggie Sinclair, the British protagonist, is an ageing and jaded ex-Rock-Star from yesteryear, who suffered profound heartbreak at the loss of his true love, early on in his career.Disillusioned, disconnected and very much alone in his luxurious New York penthouse, he only becomes more depressed by dwelling upon the nature of a pact he made in his youth - a pact in which he sold his soul to the Devil in return for his incredible success, fame and fortune. And as he knows only too well because of the recurring visits of the Devil's emissary, the Devil is eagerly waiting to collect.There is however, something more running beneath this odd but apparently simple plot construct. And that something brings Reggie into contact not only with a coven of modern-day witches, but also with a collection of Knights Templar, all of whom have abilities, knowledge and motivations which Reggie only slowly begins to uncover and understand.Mr. Jenvey draws his characters fairly well, and we find ourselves happily accompanying the affable Reggie as he travels ever-deeper into a looking-glass land where maybe, just maybe, he might find the help he needs to be able to snatch his soul back from the Devil's collection-plate! Indeed it transpires there is much more than Reggie's soul at stake in the infernal battle between good and evil which is always underway in this world.There are a few minor annoyances which should have been (and can be) corrected with better proofing (at least for the Kindle version which I read for this review), but nothing so dramatic that it really overshadows the feelgood nature of the charming storyline and the reader's enthusiasm to continue with the journey.In closing, I have only kind words for this excursion into fantasyland which Mr. Jenvey takes us on. Woven into the fantasy are elements of philosophy and real-life quandaries which give the reader pause ... to think things like "What would I do?" or "What would I want?" if a similar crossroads were placed in my path. Harsher critics may choose to take issue with the overall "feelgoody" nature of the novel's forces for good, but in my opinion that would be churlish. There is more than enough here to make "Angela's Coven" a journey I enjoyed undertaking. I award it 4 out of 5 stars.Nick Vasey(Reviewed for LLBookReview.com)Author of 'Roppongi' </p>

 <p> Angela's Coven brings magic and the Christian concept of Satan together in a delightful story. And the fact that Satan loses spectacularly makes it even better. Add an aging rock star and a coven of witches, and Mr. Jenvey has a recipe for success.This book is a must-read for anyone interested in magic, the Knights Templar, and the war between good and evil. </p>

 <p> Writing from the perspective of a fellow author, I have a unique perspective on this book, so here goes: Bruce Jenvey, author of  Angela's Coven, creates a wonderful and positive story surrounding paranormal and occult powers used for good over evil, and he does so through the struggle of a personable young rock star, Reggie Sinclair, who meets and falls in love wih Angela Bradbury and her Cabbottown Witches, all of whom are delightful students of the dark arts. Angela herself is the kind of witch every man would like to have at his side in a fight, especially a fight for one's soul. This is where Reggie presently finds himself in his life. He in fact is facing a fate worse than death.Mr. Jenvey's portrayal of events that lead Reggie out of the darkness of a sure trip to Hades is both fascinating and inspiring. When Angela comes into Reggie's life, he thinks it is happenstance, but nothing could be further from the truth. She's come to him with a plan to empower him against the forces of evil just as she has empowered herself against such matters.There is a comfort in the familiar tug of war between good and evil that readers will respond to in traveling the path that Reggie Sinclair has chosen, one which has led him into dire circumstances. Who has not made wrong choices in the dark, that is without understanding the ripple effect of a bad choice? Who is not a little insane at 3AM?Still, Reggie's choices now have Mr. Ajax, Satan's lawyer hot on Reggie's and Angela's heels. Every hope falls to the unconditional love Reggie finds with Angela to put off and finally finish off Mr. Ajax - who has his own distasteful history to deal with, along with running errands between Hades and Earth.In the end, ANGELA's COVEN is an uplifting tale of the everlasting war between moral turpitude and courage in the face of overwhelming odds. The author's ability with words allows us to fully immerse ourselves in each character's point of view. This is indeed a modern day Morality Play, no doubt of it, and the heroes are what we hope to be in real life as we read Angela's Coven. </p>

 <p> Angela's Coven will have you laughing, crying and biting your nails.  You do not want to have anything in your mouth when they arrive at Cabbottown and discuss the uses of spider poop.  Mr. Jenvey, you bad, bad boy!  You're making us real witches look bad.  I'm sure you know what we really use it for...There were plot twists that knocked me for a loop and then made me think, "Why didn't I see that coming?"  Some of them had me yelling at the book and my kids and grandkids poking their heads in my room to see what I was so excited about.You really do have to meet these delightful witches and this poor, confused, overwhelmed rock star and join them in their struggle to save his soul.  You won't be able to put it down! </p>

 <p> The author, Bruce Jenvey, shows us in the very first paragraph the islolation and loneliness of the wealthy rock star, Reggie Sinclair. Reggie meets the witch, Angela, at her shop in Greenwich Village and the adventure begins. We come face to face with the devil, his lawyer, and some potion cooking witches.You'll be surprised at the twists of this first novel in the Cabbottown Witch series. The dying star gets help from more than his witch friends. Jenvey's writing is top-notch, running us through a gamut of emotions. This is a must read. </p>

 <p> Reggie Sinclair, an aging rock star has mellowed with age and is now in the grip of terminal cancer. Angela, an immortal witch, part of the Cabbottown Coven. What do they have in common - they have both sold their souls to the devil and Ajax, the devil's henchman, is waiting to collect.As soon as I saw the cover of Angela's Coven I knew I had to read it, and I was right. This is my type of book. I love novels that keep the pace going without the lulls which give the reader the chance to get bored. You won't find any lulls in this book. Witches, the devil and his underling and the good guys, both the coven and ancestors, were there to help turn Ajax from his evil ambition and kept me intrigued as I wondered what would happen next.I'm not sure how the author got so much into this book, but it's one of those you can't put down. Angela's Coven is not a comical book, but it has a lighthearted thread all the way through from Angela and Reggie's banter to the Devil's dealings with Ajax. Throw in explosions, spells, ethereal beings and the occasional scene that pulls at the heartstrings. Previously unknown links also pop up when least expected. All these make this a good book to read or give as a present. No heavy scenes so suitable for teenagers upwards but enjoyable by every age.Well done Bruce Jenvey, if the next one in the series is as good, you're on a winning streak. </p>

 <p> This was definitely a different take on the whole god versus evil scenario. For one thing, there was plenty of humor to go around!Reggie, a musician who sold his soul to the devil in exchange of a successful musical career is facing death and is none too happy about. He is a great character to follow, someone with flaws but who captures the reader's attention from the very beginning. Angela, a witch, is not as fully realized, but she still has some good moments. Maddy, Angela's aunt, is a hoot to read about. She is feisty enough to count for three people, and some of her scenes had me laughing out loud. Lucifer is equally charming, as is expected, and definitely steals many of the scenes.The plot is fast-paced which is wonderful, never letting the reader get bored. There are a few grammatical issues but nothing horrifying so it shouldn't deter you from picking this book up.This is a fun one and I do recommend it to lovers of the paranormal genre and even those of you who like a bit of humor in your stories. I'll definitely be looking forward to the next one in the series. </p>

 <p> Loved it! Excellently written!This was the first witch book I have ever read written by a man. I did not know what to expect. This book was a very pleasant surprise. I am not the only one who thinks so - this book is getting great reviews on B&N;, Amazon and Goodreads. It kinda of reminded me a little of "Practical Magic", and "Discovery of Witches" (2 of my favorite witch books!), it had that flavor to it.There was only one part that I did not like (and I will not give it away) otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars from me. The rest of the story I loved. This is your basic "Good vs. Bad" just like in "The Stand" you have Guardian Angels and even Lucifer himself but with the new added twist of some witches thrown in the mix.There is great character development - I absolutely loved Angela! I didn't know if I liked Reggie at first but he did grow on me. I also liked all the other witches (they totally reminded me of the witches in "Practical Magic") as well as the "Templars". Oh! and I learned what a Templar was -"a member of a religious military order founded by Crusaders in Jerusalem about 1118, and suppressed in 1312." and "The Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon , commonly known as the Knights Templar, the Order of the Temple or simply as Templars, were among the most famous of the Western Christian military orders. The organization existed for nearly two centuries during the Middle Ages."Needless to say they were the good guys! It was a very interesting mix of characters.There are lots of little surprises in this book that will make you smile and giggle. And towards the end I had tears in my eyes - twice! Any book that makes me cry is a good book in my book, LOL.This story had a GREAT ending! It was very well thought out and creative.Surprisingly and happily this is a very clean book - no swearing or sex! Thanks for that - Bruce!I have one question for Bruce - Will there be more  Cabbottown Witch books? I do hope so! </p>
