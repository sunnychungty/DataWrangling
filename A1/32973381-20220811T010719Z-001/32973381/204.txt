 <p> The film begins at the Hall of Justice in the Public Defender's office. Joan talks to a person before leaving on vacation. She is in love with Eddie Taylor, who has been convicted of crimes three times. The next time it will be life. Joan greets him on his release from prison, they are married. They are not wanted at the Valley Tavern. Eddie is fired from his truck driving job. Now he has to pay the rest of the down payment on the house he bought. He can't find another job. Next there is a robbery of a bank during a money delivery. Has Eddie done something wrong? Or was his hat stolen and planted as a false clue? Will he run away or be convicted and executed for the murders? Was there forensic evidence or was he convicted by his reputation? The film skips over these details. "If the hat fits you can't acquit."Joan easily bought a pistol at a pawn shop in her state, but the attempt failed. A meal is delivered to Eddie; a hidden message is in the tray. Eddie gets placed in isolation. Will he be able to escape in the foggy night? Will there be new evidence to stop the planned execution? Will there be a dramatic event to release Eddie? Will there be an ironic ending? You can't expect a happy ending for this story.This 1937 film seems a little too simple even for those times. </p>

 <p> This film makes one wonder how many innocent men and women have been unfairly tried, convicted and murdered for crimes they did not commit.This forgotten gem of the 1930s is excellent in every way...even with its downbeat theme and tragic ending.  Henry Fonda is superb as is Sylvia Sidney with her sad eyes and woeful expressions, genuine and true-to-life.The DVD is very good quality.  There are a few scratches on the print of the film, but all in all it is great.  The audio is great as well.  As mentioned in a previous review, this DVD has no extras.  But, then of course, it doesn't need any. Just to have this film is enough.  I thought I would never get to see it but I have been wanting to for a long time, ever since I read its detailed synopsis of Jerry Vermilye's book "The Films of the Thirties".  Imagine my surprise and delight when I found it had been released on DVD.  I ordered it immediately and I just finished watching it.It is a thought provoking, tragic film but it is great entertainment nonetheless and makes one stop to think...judge not lest ye be judged.  Outstanding in every way! </p>

 <p> This is not one of Mr. Lang's great films. Although not bad, it does give an impression of being shot with a little budget and not much time. The script is not talented. The story is very interesting and would have made an excellent Hitchcock movie (actually Hitchcock did make something alike) if more care had been dispensed.Henry Fonda and Sylvia Sidney are excellent -specially she. But the rest of the cast are given cartoonish and exagerated roles as bad 'guys'. I believe that Mr. Lang may have saved this film from being even worse treated by somebody even less talented than him, but just didn't do as good a job as he usually does. So it remains as a failed Lang film, but a pretty good one, considering that it is a Lang film. </p>

 <p> Released convict Eddie Taylor (Henry Fonda) tries to make an honest living for himself and his devoted wife, Joan (Sylvia Sidney), but the cards are stacked against them in this dark, fatalistic film from director Fritz Lang.  This entertaining melodrama takes our characters on quite a rollercoaster ride, but cops out in its final seconds with a quite literal deus ex machina ending.  I suspect that the ludicrous final moments of this film were tacked on by studio hacks who felt that the ending was too downbeat otherwise and probably didn't have the sanction of Lang.  Fonda is convincingly angst-ridden in contrast to top-billed Sidney's comparatively simplistic cute, plucky performance./ </p>

 <p> After "Fury" , Fritz Lang stroke again with "You only live once", a bitter, desperate and poignant film that denounces and carves in relief the committed injustices behind the legal system. Eddie Taylor (Henry Fonda) has been sent to prison and released for the third time. His fianc&eacute;e Joan Graham (Sylvia Sydney) has awaited for him during three long years and this time will be different.So when they decide to get marry, the public opinion has taken by storm the primacy of the justice based on his past. As a matter of fact, he decides to reform himself thanks to a decent job, but the happiness is very brief. He is fired and then he is forced to leave the room the same night of his honey-moon. He returns to his ex employer and begs for being forgiven but obtains a rotund "no" as answer. That fact is the last drop that fills his patience and so the destiny introduces its silent arms in this horrid episode. Blamed by a heist he was not involved, he comes back to prison, convinced by his wife based in his innocence. But meanwhile the clock establishes the day of the execution.And so (like an anticipated Hitchcock), the essential evidence comes a little bit late, and he becomes a murderer.Once again, Lang appoints the finger establishing what's right and what's wrong and how the redemption of an ex con is simply an utopia.A tragic movie that reveals a supreme tour de force performance of Fonda. Watch how Lang makes a marvelous shot in the minute 7:43,  that anticipates to Gregg Toland in "Citizen Kane."Maybe that had been the reason Hitchcock chose him in "The wrong man" twenty years later. Don't miss this jewel of the Noir Film. </p>

 <p> I was mostly entertained by this one, sometimes because the script and acting were compelling and sometimes because the script and acting were laughably bad. When Fonda and/or Sidney are around, it's the former, and when not, usually the latter.YOLO is a pretty basic crime drama/romance, ending as a Bonnie and Clydish flick lifted out of the ordinary by the leads, and Fritz Lang's very tight helming. He constructs quite a few truly fine shots and scenes; the very proto-noir, chiaroscuro shot of the iconically moody, can't-get-an-even-break Fonda in his cell from the opposite ceiling corner, with the light streaming out in long cylindrical splinters, is a real classic. Lang keeps things moving well, and despite some lame dialogue among the extras, the movie flows and rarely gets boring. And there are a few decent, corny laughs along the way, a little social commentary here and there that still rings true, plus a couple solid performances by William Gargan and Barton MacClane; some of those old '30s character actors have a pleasantly hammy touch not seen much anymore, outside of Walken and a few others.The film does get kind of obvious and predictable on occasion, and the plot is pretty cheesy at times {spoiler: they're really going to let him go even after he holds the priest at gunpoint to break out? Come on!}, but all told its positives make it well worth the time of any fan of the leads, director, or tragic noirs in general. Not to mention those who enjoy most any decent (or even corny) old b&w; film for the trip back in time.But be warned: the print is one of the worst old scratchfests I've seen since late night movies on our old RCA console tv in the 70s; this is about as far from blu-ray as it gets, short of an etch-a-sketch. </p>

 <p> "You Only Live Once" is a fatalistic proto-noir film directed by Fritz Lang and starring Henry Fonda as Eddie Taylor, a "three-time loser", thrice convicted of crimes involving robbery. One more misstep will get him a death sentence. But Eddie is confident that won't happen. His ladylove Joan (Sylvia Sidney) has waited 3 years for Eddie to be released from prison, and when he sees her waiting outside the prison gates, Eddie is committed to starting a new life with Joan at his side. The couple get married; Eddie takes a job driving trucks; and for a while they are blissfully happy. But when Eddie loses his job and someone plants his hat at the scene of a local bank robbery, Eddie is blamed and loses all control of his destiny.I give "You Only Live Once" such a high rating for its affecting performances. The characters' anguish and frustration are palpable and completely empathetic. Henry Fonda's best moments are after Eddie has lost his job and cannot find another one. His struggle to persevere through financial pressures and temptation to return to a life of crime come through in every gesture and line of dialogue. Even greater is Eddie's crushing feeling that he is failing his wife.Sylvia Sidney contributes the most moving performance. Joan's values change over the course of the film, as she goes from being an optimistic, affectionate working girl to disillusionment with the institutions and moral certainties she once took for granted. In fact, Joan's change is so radical that she becomes disillusioned with the whole idea of doing the "right thing". "We have a right to live," she says. And she commits herself to do anything it takes. Her love for Eddie is also among the most convincing I've seen in a movie. She loves him with all her being and can hardly live with the idea that Eddie's sacrifice for her may have brought his troubles. The scenes of Eddie and Joan together on the run convey a loving partnership that makes the story tragic. All the while, Joan's boss, Public Defender Stephen Whitney (Burton MacLane), has worked tirelessly to defend Eddie for the crimes he did commit and those he didn't, apparently because he is in love with Joan. So even though the course of "You Only Live Once" is dark, it contains some of the most convincing representations of selfless romantic love I have seen.The DVD (Image Entertainment 2003 release): This isn't a restored print of the film. The image has white specks on it, although not enough to interfere with the enjoyment of the film. The disc doesn't have any features except for scene selections, which you find by pressing your "menu" button. There is no main menu to speak of. </p>

 <p> Fritz Lang's best films were already behind him when he arrived in Hollywood. He would not surpass the films he made in Germany, but his American films are almost always worth seeing and sometimes approach greatness. You Only Live Once is one such film. The story concerns sympathetic criminal Eddie (Henry Fonda) trying to go straight and the woman who has stayed by him, legal secretary Joan (Sylvia Sidney). Lang makes the audience root for Eddie, who is not a typical snarling thirties gangster, but a basically decent man who through bad luck and bad choices has found himself in a desperate situation. Fonda is perfect for this role, and gives a fine performance. Sidney is equally good as a woman fighting against friends, family and circumstances to stay with the man she loves. It is her performance which makes the film a terrific romance as well as a fine thriller.The print on the Image DVD is fairly good. It shows quite a lot of wear and tear, but seems complete. There may be many scratches, but the black and white photography still looks stunning with good detail and clarity. The soundtrack unfortunately has a great deal of hiss and crackle. Occasionally this makes the dialogue quite hard to hear. Nevertheless the film is still perfectly watchable and the flaws present in the print and soundtrack did not spoil my enjoyment of what remains an excellent film. The DVD has no extras. </p>

 <p> A weird film that combines realism with surrealism, drama with fantasy, plays romantic background music where more foreboding music might be expected & has a totally illogical ending. But though it leaves the viewer wondering it's explained by the fact that the director is Fritz Lang & it's his way of movie-making. Makes you sort of think about life. </p>

 <p> You Only Live Once is a dark little Fritz Lang drama from 1937. It's the story of Eddie Taylor, a man falsely accused of committing a heinous bank robbery (a crime which we believe he committed until a crucial moment later in the film), and his devoted wife Joan, with whom he goes on the run for several weeks in an attempt to go to the border (they never do reach the border, do they?). What makes this such a wonderful film are the subtleties, the grocer at the beginning complaining about the police officer stealing an apple a day from his stand, the sublime scene where Eddie and Joan stand by a frog-pond and Eddie recalls how his first 'rap' came after attacking a boy who had cruelly maimed and tortured a frog, the conversation between two prison cooks preparing Eddie's last meal about how a chicken was slaughtered to feed a man who is himself about to be slaughtered... The society we're presented with here is a dark one indeed, one that is nearly devoid of any compassion or justice. The priest, Father Dolan, provides the moral voice of the film. But in an ironic and grim plot twist, Eddie and he secure each others' deaths. Kudos especially to Henry Fonda, who delivers a convincing, and subtly shaded, performance as Eddie. Sylvia Sidney is good too, especially in a minor scene where she smashes the window of a drug store to obtain some medicine for Eddie. This is a very good film, and at around 87 minutes, it doesn't overstay its welcome. Don't pass up this early, gripping classic from Fritz Lang. </p>

 <p> Dark and broodingly pessimistic, Fritz Lang's second Hollywood movie is a love story of sorts.  Made in 1937 and set in the present day (ie, the Depression), Lang has favorite actress Sylvia Sidney fall for `three-time loser' Henry Fonda.  Sidney is, conveniently, the pretty young secretary of the local public defender, while Fonda is a chronic convict who robs, kidnaps, and murders for the gal he loves.  Or something like that - tag lines tend to exaggerate things.  In any event, the warden reminds Fonda on the verge of his third release that, if convicted and sentenced again, we throw away the key.  This being a Lang movie, justice is flawed, the mobs are vicious, and sour-stomached Fate is inevitable.In Lang's first American movie, FURY, Spencer Tracy played an innocent man falsely accused and `lynched' - not with a rope, but the jail he was being held in was bombed and burned to the ground.  Mobs are tough in Lang's movies, and anyone with a rap sheet is going to get the extreme short end of the stick.  Fonda, we learn, was more or less corrupted by the system.  His initial crime had to do with a fight he got into with someone pulling the legs off a frog.  See?  He was a good guy, once.  All that crime stuff is in the past, though, and with pretty young Sidney at his side his prospects look rosy, indeed.Such is the set-up, a march to domestic happiness primed to get all gummed up by a society averse to extending a hand to a jailbird.  Again like FURY, the first half of this film builds us up to a happy and triumphant conclusion, only to change direction at midpoint and proceed down a darker and more hostile path.  Employees don't give jailbirds a second chance, whether or not they have a new bride and mortgage to be paid.  What's an ex-con to do?Like many of Lang's movies, YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE pits his hero against society and its flawed engines of justice.  Fonda isn't an innocent, but he's recognizably one-of-us, and to that extent you're emotionally involved in his fate.  Also like FURY, YOLO is neatly divided into two section after something really bad happens and Sidney and Fonda embark on a Bonnie and Clyde like odyssey.I had a few minor problems with this picture.  I found an arrest of Fonda, and what happened after, implausible.  I won't reveal what it was, but I had big problems with what the System did with Fonda after they met him for the fourth time.  If you're going to make socially conscious movies you have to portray society accurately and believably.  Any deviation calls into question the entire story, and this one, in my opinion, has a deviation you can drive a truck through.That said, this is an above-average movie.  Lang had a terrible reputation with male actors - Tracy loathed him and vowed never to work with him again - but he coaxes a nicely nuanced performance from Fonda, a broad arc that take him from toned-down bashful (his comfort zone stuff) to a couple of scenes where he acts Cagney-tough and looks strikingly like John Dillinger.  The ending is a downer, corny and expressionistic.  Forgetting the less-than-credible preceding events, Sidney and Fonda's second-half run is exciting and works quite well.  Sylvia Sidney, an underrated actress then and pretty much forgotten today, has a bright vulnerability to her that suits the movie. </p>
